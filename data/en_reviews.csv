2	A voucher to nowhere #skypickerfail 2400 out of pocket due to skypicker delays in their booking office
5	I booked with Kiwi for the first time, just a short flight from Göteborg to London. I had forgotten my middle name in the fill-out section and was quite worried I had to pay for another ticket. Dominika and Nikola resolved the situation in good time with no extra cost. Thank you very much, will be booking again!
5	I would like to say THANKS YOU for your customer services dept and especially to one of your employees, Tomas Jurik ( Travel Consultant), for the excellent service he provided me today .I have always been pleased with the service I receive from <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com>. However, Mr Jurik's professionalism and ability to get to the bottom of the situation quickly exceeded my expectations.Such a commitment to great customer service is to be commended. You can be sure that I will continue to use <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> in future too.//S Rana
5	I just noticed 2 hours before my flight that I still haven't checked in online yet, as the email with the notification landed in my spam folder. Eric could help me very fast and still manage my check-in for me so I got the e-tickets in time. Thank you so much!
2	This is the first time I have dealt with Skypicker, after being referred to them by Kayak.The good thing is that they are easily accessible on the phone and the staff are polite and friendly.However, I don't think I will ever book through them again. I spent a nightmare 12 hours or so dealing with complications related to the outbound itinerary.First of all, Skypicker doesn't tell customers clearly when making a booking that LUGGAGE MUST BE PURCHASED SEPARATELY for each leg of an itinerary even if the entire journey is on one bookingFor e.g. we bought an Air Asia ticket from Singapore to Melbourne. The journey was routed with a short stopover in Kuala Lumpur.We received ONE booking reference for this from Skypicker. When we went online to purchase the luggage or called them, they wanted us to pay for the same luggage twice. First for Singapore to KUL and then KUL to Melbourne. Skypicker's system issued me TWO PNR numbers for this one itinerary.I spent hours and hours fighting this. At one point, I had both Air Asia and Skypicker on the speakerphone AT THE SAME TIME. Air Asia insisted I should not have been issued with two PNRs and but Skypicker kept insisting this was an AirAsia problem.After hours of going back and forth, Skypicker acknowledged that this is not fair and I should be quoted for ONE luggage purchase price, which is what I paid.Now, for the return journey - again, one booking for Melbourne to Jogjakarta, with a stopover in Denpasar, Skypicker at first insisted I pay for luggage twice but when I reminded them of earlier conversations, the staff member came back with one price.To summarise, even if you book one A to B journey on Skypicker, you may be slapped with paying for luggage more than once.In the end, the flights may come out cheaper on Skypicker but with the hours of time wasted with dealing with issues AND the subsequent double or higher charges for luggage, Skypicker turns out to be more expensive that mainstream flight providers.
5	I was concerned because I needed to meet up with my connecting flights. But it worked out without a hitch, and I was very glad that it was so straight forward. Each flight (if there is a stop-over is printed out on a different page which makes it easy to control your intinery information when checking in. I would recommend this service to anyone.
1	The process of refund my money took 4 months after numerous calls and emails.  Airline returned US $369 to <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>, and <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> Customer support agreed in their email that I should receive 341 EUR.  At the end, they only returned 217 EUR to me without any explanation.  My email for a justification went into black hole.  Nobody bother to reply.
5	Very good service thanks to Pavel F. also.
5	Astrid at customer service provided me with prompt and professional assistance
5	Thanks for the fast reply and support and the good surface.
5	"Very convenient booking of a complicated trip. I booked a two week ""Prague - Goteborg - Bergen - Trondheim - Kaunas - Budapest"" trip. Tickets landed in my mailbox, just scanned the code in the machine at the airport and off I was."
5	Olga helped me out with my issue today and I am greatful for their efficiency and professionalism.
5	I had never booked with sky picker before and was flying one way to australia from london. Big move, and i was worried with using a new site as i didnt want anything to go wrong and be stuck.. The price was about £200 cheaper than anywhere else i could find. I thought i hope this isnt a cheap price and it all goes wrong. Usually its cheap for a reason. Anyway! All was fine, as smooth as can be. Transferred through frankfurt and delhi and on to sydney. NO PROBLEMS AT ALL, would definetely use sky picker again. 5/5
5	I had a minor issue with checking in and <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> fixed it instantly. No waiting time on the line and the employee was very helpful. After a couple of minutes, my problem was solved. <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> is a case study in how to provide excellent customer service, inside an industry that often seems to have forgotten it.
1	This company allows fraudulent transactions to go through.  Their customer care team are hopeless and don't want to help.
5	Thanks for the really great help from Michal Havelka! You are the best! My problem was completely solved and now I have no worries!)) Thank you for your professionalism, prompt problem solving and for such a pleasant conversation! I will recommend you to everyone!
1	I'm not able to fly due to illness of my mother. I can't find a cancellation button anywhere . I am trying to get a refund and the customer service is not helpful at all .would be nice to get some money back since I even payed for extra luggage . It  says changes can be made 36 hours before departure obviously not
5	Today Miroslav was very helpful, quick and courteous. Many thanks! On the down side, I am not sure why Kiwi does not provide the correct codes for customers to do their own check-in directly online with the airline they are travelling with. It is cumbersome and unnecessary. In any case, the service provided by Miroslav was excellent.
5	Very good Compagny and for help with new tickets cool support aya
4	I talked to a few people today from Kiwi while trying to change my flight, and sometimes I was  they were all helpful, but I would like to specifically thank Barbara for helping me and calling me just so I do not run out of credit abroad and  Catalina for sending me a helpful email.
5	Thank you very much for the service! I spoke with Odra P. over the phone to check in me and it was in a quick and professional manner! Thanks again.:)
5	To date I have been very please at the level of excellent service that I have received.
5	Thank you, Allan Whitfield, for taking the time and effort to help me with my booking and all. You are all very kind and helpful indeed.
5	It is my first time using kiwi and I wasn't able to upgrade my cabin bag. I wrote to the 24/7 support and I got all the help I needed from Irina and i asked a looot of questions
5	Lukas was friendly and competent.. great Support. Thanks for it.
1	Skypicker cancelled my return flights from Vietnam at approx 5.30am via email on the day of the flights. (They cancelled them because they had not left two hours between connecting flights - their bad. It is true the airline adjusted the timing, but even the original timings did not leave 2 hrs) I read it at approx 8am and realised the new flights were leaving soon and I had a mad dash to the airport, cutting my holiday short and leaving my best friend on her own in Vietnam. When I got to the airport they told me they had not booked these flights for me and I had to buy them myself!!!!! These flights came with an 18 hour layover - which I would NEVER have chosen. They were also very difficult to communicate with and did not return my urgent emails. I used the live chat function, but was just told 'your case is being considered'. I told them of the urgency, but I was just fobbed off. They then blamed me because I didn't answer my landline. I don't have a landline - not at home, not on holiday! I was told they would contact me via email, but they didn't until it was too late. Cut a long story, they are not going to refund all my out of pocket expenses. I am left with being messed about, very bad communication, stranded in Vietnam and paying extra for it!!!!!Then I find out that they could have booked me onto a different flight, which had times that were much closer to the originals. I assume they didn't offer me that because they were the more expensive option. I took the cheaper option and now they won't refund me the full cost of the room I took for my 18hour, overnight layover, which was the cheapest room I could find and still way way cheaper than the better  flights that they didn't offer me. Absolutely appalling. Thank goodness I had a credit card and didn't have my kids with me.
5	Perfect trip. Very cheap
5	very good
1	"the company answer ANY question with a mashine. its not possible to book a ticket for a child even if they say its possible. i was on a ""life"" chat with a mashine and then told do u want a trantscript. im not impress. and my son will NEVER EVER use kiwi again. i also tried to call. same answer"
4	I had a pretty good experience with skypicker.  Cheapest airline option, saved me at least $100 for me to fly from the USA to Europe.  There was a small inconvenience when my boarding passes wouldn't download properly and the first customer service staff member did not help me.  However, the second time I called and was connected to Johnathan (Jonathan?), and he helped me figure things out. Thanks Johnathan!
5	"I have used the Skypickers website for 4 travel bookings so far and will continue to make them my first internet search.  Their website is straight-forward and if you have any issues that need ""human"" intervention they can be contacted easily by phone.  If they say they will call back in half an hour they do so and with the answer to the question.The team members I have spoken to are always polite and friendly - perfect balance - as well as getting the job done in a very pleasant manner."
4	I bought the cheapest ticket i could find from Denmark to India.The purchase of ticket went rather smooth and got a text message on the phone immediately, which was a nice instant confirmation.It was however annoying, that they limit their handbagage to only 5 kg(Usually these are 8-12kg).Along with that, i had to pay extra for an actual bag - Which is to be expected, when travelling with the cheap airlines. However the problem here, was that they also had a lower kg-limit than most other ticket providers. This was set to 15 kg (Instead of 20-25 kg as regular) and i was UNABLE to purchase extra kilos, not even to pay for 2x 15 kg bags.It was a bit of a struggle to limit my things, to only 15 kg, when travelling 7000 km away - Then you usually stay for more than just the weekend.I did not use their support or services, so i would not know how they are in case of mistakes or problems.
5	Quick and prompt with solving any issues. The phone was picked up only after two rings and the person on the other side solved my enquiry in no time.Didn't have to worry about boarding passes for any of my three flights as Kiwi would check me in and email me the bp beforehand.Great service!
5	Just bought tickets to go to our honeymoon in Europe this summer! Excellent deals and a customer service! @skypickercom
1	I was doing searches from San Diego to Cancun and was trying different searches and one of the cheapest ways  was to fly from TJ to Mexico City and than to Cancun and skypicker came up. I planned the trip 3 months in advance and even called and confirmed-  and was so looking forward to our family vacation to find out when I got there 3 hours early that they had no reservations for us!!! my credit card was charged 3 months prior remember they got the money and left my family in TJ with no reservaciones!!! Thank God  we were  there three hours before because they made me go back and wait in another customer service line to hear the same thing sorry the company never paid us and we have no tickets for you....that was our start of the Perfect Vacation- so after many calls on my end- and several hour of nervous waiting  the customer service guy came running to us with tickets right before the flight... and than we had to worry if we were going to have the same problem coming home- Thank You  very much Skypicker...
5	I bought the cheapest tickets through this service. It is also very fast support service. Thank you!
5	Such a pleasure to know that you will be properly looked after by people who really want to help. As much as an internet based service can, this feels very personal and interested in the customer. It also has great deals. So glad I found <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>!
5	I always use this website to look for flights and bookings. They do a very useful service to passengers, by check-in automatically and make you avoid wasting too much time at airport and saving some money!They also have a prompt and great customer service..lately I found out I didn't add my ID info to my documents and the time for online check in was over, since my flight was in less than 72 hours. Luckily I found an helpful agent Lukas P, who helped me in a very timely manner, fixing everything! I absolutely suggest this company to all travellers out there!It's great! Simply great!

5	I have a problem with my tickets skypicker dont send me for tree days i have to fly today
4	Even though it took a bit time untill an agent was availble but it was worth the waiting because the agent I got, Lorena Gallo, was very helpful and willing to help.  I got all the answer about my booking clearly and simply.
5	Today I had a great experience with one of Kiwi's agents  Jan L, she helped me to book my seat, they are very gentile and attentive to details. I would definitely recommend them for booking your flights...I booked the flights with kiwi with anticipation, while flying across the continent, I had a delay and lost one of my connections, they helped me to reach my destination, and even offered a hotel and meals... Even though that was not necessary, they relieved my stress and walked me through the entire nightmareThanks for everything :)
5	Very happy with the service. Very responsive. Thanks Aurelija
5	pretty good so far , our agent Yulia krasenko, was answering fast  at our  questions and we  could continue our online booking.  thank you! i recomend  their services! and keep on the good job!
5	Great and quick service by Tetiana Pomogaieva ! Very much appreciated
4	Kristyna was very helpful and thorough with her assistance. We had several issues with our tickets and she showed genuine support and went above and beyond to make sure these issues are solved.
4	I had been planning a multi leg journey when i came across Skypicker's site. Overall, it was the most comfortable and offered the best pricing. Would defeinitely use them again!
5	the support provided by Sena in the chat was excellent! she solved all the problems. highly recommended.
5	I contacted the live chat to ask about extra luggage, tha agent was Alexey, so helpful and kind the information wasn't accessible at the moment but they sent it to me really detailed
5	many thanks to petya who helped me with my questions
1	Customer service is terrible
5	Not much to say.I was asked to print my E-tickets and show them at the check-in desk.I did as asked and i had no problems on my journey back home.5 stars (:
5	Lukas was very helpful and solved my problem very quickly, couldn't be more satisfied with the service and efficiency.
5	I made a mistake in the name with my airticket reservation, after a contact with a kind Polina everything was resolved  in a very short time and also for free. They sent me a new ticket with a right name in a couple of hours without paying a fee for changing. Thank you all lot, Polina and Bartolomey!
1	Dear All! DO NOT CHOOSE OR BUY ANY TICKET FROM THIS SYSTEM, THEY ARE SCAM. THEY SELL TICKETS WHICH DO NOT EXIST!!!!!
5	Excellent customer service!! Very professional and I received  a appropriate a prompt answer.
1	So angry so today tried booking flights to Palma from Bristol and back , got email and the flights were wrong way round this cost me over £800 they were Ryanair flights booked through <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> , I rang within 5 secs at 10.30am to say this is wrong I'll need to cancel and get a refund so I can rebook , it's now 6pm and still haven't had a answer and am due to fly tomorrow 6am and still don't have a REFUNDWhen we rang Ryanair they told us my husband also wasn't booked onto the flight , we're not now going on our hoilday because a simple thing like giving me a refund I could of found the flights maybe some ware else.
5	I have a journey booked with three different flights and called to ask about luggage allowances and seat allocation.  The team members went beyond my expectations - even so far as to call me in Mexico with information as it came in.  Katie K was the first person I contacted and she left me a message and also followed up with an email after calling all of the airlines to find out the luggage allowances.Lucie O'Bryan blew my mind.  She found me an aisle seat after I had been given a middle seat on a long haul LAX - LGW and she also explained Norwegian airlines do not provide complimentary food on long haul flights and the cost of food is quite expensive - buy before you fly! Lucie is a superstar and my experience with Kiwi would make me definetly use them again.  Fingers crossed the flights go well - I will update from the other side.  Thanks to Kiwi team for making my life easier and saving me money
5	I am thery satisfied of your services and suport quality!
2	Booking was easy enough. The price, however kept changing. As I searched options the price kept going up as I looked over it on their page! When I did decide on the flight I wanted they said it had gone up by almost twice due to the airline! OK. I cleared the cache and guess what: the price had fallen when I rechecked!Chalking it up to a bug, I said OK. Looking at reviews of Skypicker I decided to take the plunge.OK. paying was seamless.This is where it gets a little exciting. Neither airline had any record of the flight! I had to email Skypicker, then the airlines had the reservation!Another issue, totally my creation. I misspelt the name of someone travelling with me. The airline said they cannot change the name. Skypicker is claiming that the airline wants E220 to change the name! In my currency that's almost TT$2000! Skypicker's wholesaler Hahn Air said the agency can do it for free, but Skypicker is still claiming that it is the airline that wants the E220! I know this was my mistake, but if Skypicker wants to make the extra profit say so!I will not be doing any more business with them. I do hope the vacation is without any more problems...
5	Lorena Gallo just helped me with a cancellation due to a silly mistake I made. She was so helpful, and I immediately got the right flight booked instead. Thanks so much!
1	I requested for an itinerary..e ticket..skypicker sent me # and 4 numbers
5	I spoke with a lovely girl by the name of Petra who cleared up any queries I had about my booking very quickly, while at the same time spreading some Christmas cheer and turned a bad situation into a very positive one. Give that girl a raise, and my phone number :)But honestly she was so helpful and is a great asset to your company. The  service so far has been very good. I would recommend Kiwi to all my friends. Very helpful and prompt. Happy New Year
4	quickly booking and online-check in.great
5	I booked a flight about one months ago and today I realized that I didn't receive any email about my booking numbers yet. Unfortunately it was too late to check my spam folder which was already deleted. So I went on the web page of skypicker and saw the lifechat. Luckily, I had a really nice agend named Eva who helped me finding my booking details and send me my lost email! It was so easy and helped me a lot. Thank you!
4	Thanks to James Tickner for great customer in helping with a refund for an excess baggage charge that could not be arranged with the airline directly.  Saved me time and effort.
1	Too many unnecessary emails from Kiwi stating enter your passport details or pay Euro 30. Click on the link and there is no option to add passport details. Very complicated method of operations. How upon earth do they expect busy travelers to be following their instructions.
5	Nice and easy to use! Great prices and when i got confused the online support was extremelly helpfull
1	"DO NOT use <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> i have the worst experience ever with them! I usually do not believe in making complaints but I want to warn people about their awful service!Firstly; it took 5 months for kiwi to change one name on my booking, this took 20+ hours of conversation on their ""Live Chat"" service. In the end it turned out they hadn't changed the name so we were not allowed on the flight as one of us had not been checked in by kiwi. We then had to wait in the airport for 8 hours before kiwi admitted it was their fault. I had to pay for food and an overnight stay in the hotel which kiwi advised they would reimburse me for immediately. This was in September and I only got the refund two weeks ago. Again, this is after around 30 emails back and forth where kiwi were adamant they did not have to pay for the hotel. They eventually admitted they had promised to pay for the error and I got my money back 3 months later.I have never experienced such terrible service, the worst thing was that I not able to get one point of contact so on every call/email/chat I had to explain to a new person the extensive history which wasted so much time on both sides. I will NEVER be using them again!!"
4	I Needed some help with my tickets today and got fast professional response from Bek
5	I booked my flight with typo on my last name and the issue was being solved within 1 hour. Excellent service!
5	Thank you to the agent who helped me so professionally and effectively on the Live Chat and to all the persons involved in interacting with airlines to ensure that a spelling error I made in a surname was corrected. This was handled extremely rapidly and professionally. Thank you! Happy New Year's to all of <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> staff member!Regards,Joelle
5	Just know I finished to chat with David, he helped me very well. He explained me and solved my problem check in. I really like how he dealed me.
5	Since my flight was cancelled and my phone was not working for making any calls, I tried asking Kiwi for assistance via Facebook chat and Mr. Ondrej Koraba was there to help me find a solution for the urgency I was having to get to my destination on time. Also I received assistance from Mr. Adam Jelinek. They both not only helped me with the trip details but were very gentle and made me feel calm in those moments of tension. I would and do recommend Kiwi for their Guarantee and the great customer assistance!
4	The live chat support is really helpful on Sky Picker. It helped me fill up the details without any hassle.There were things like information abt promo codes and any joining membership bonus which i think skypicker must provide like other websites dealing with Travel.Also there shud be provision to buy extra baggage in addition to what is being offered standard/limited.
5	Exceptional service!! Glad i found this site.
4	Ok so Lusine is the best so far...but i haven't gone on my trip yet so can't really review. Very helpful via chat...I can only hope my trip is as smooth
4	your live chat really helped me, you webpage is very confusing
5	I contacted Kiwi chat and I was attended by Tomas Krivanek who kindly helped me to find the cheapest and best option for my flight. He assessed me and answered all my doubts and now Im flying for 2nd time with the kiwi support!I have suggested all my friends to try with this company!
5	I've booked flight on Skypicker for the first time, and I was sceptic for online booking (was always booking flights at the company's desk at the airport) but everything I've had to change (seats for four of us etc.!), Ms. Mary P. handled with great care, swift and with fast and accurate responses, making my flight so much more of an nice adventure while traveling to Dublin, Ireland! I hope that workers like her will get promoted, great asset to the company! Thank You Ms. Mary P.!
5	Ya compre pasajes a traves de otras agencias de viajes o vendedores de tickets de avion. Pero sinceramente <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> supero todas mis expectativas. Para comenzar tienen una excelente interfaz grafica lo que ayuda al cliente a entender los precios que uno esta pagando. Por otro lado, la Atencion al Cliente es excelente.Muchas gracias a Erol G y Chan H! Es como si estuviesen trabajando las 24hs. No fue ni por telefono, ni por Live Chat (que tambien funciona perfecto), sino que fue por mail. Y mas alla de las dificultades que el mail puede llegar a suponer en cuanto a Atencion al Cliente se refiere, estos chicos estuvieron ahi para ayudarme hasta el ultimo minuto! Incluso con problemas de Re-Embolso!Mejor que <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com>, imposible!
5	"I had a great experience today through a ""live chat"" with James.  Thank you so very much for walking me through my questions."
4	Hey there,Unfortunately my flights were cancelled due to unexpected reasons, but kiwi helped me a lot in finding the best solution esp representative Mr. Babak assisted me a lot in this issue. I am so happy to use Kiwi and will continue using them as they have the best prices among the others. KEEP GROWING KIWI ;)
1	I ordered a trip to bali from Da nang.We then realised australian school holiday was on.So me and my wife decided to change detination to <http://Phillipines.At|Phillipines.At> 2am I went on the web site and paid the extra money and change the flight,website telling me it was <http://confirmed.At|confirmed.At> this point no one ask for passport details.Went to bed woke up and checked my emails about 8am.There was an email to contact your company,witch I did.You asked for passport details wich I suppl.I asked when e tickets would be mailed.The agent told me soon.I waited for around 2hr then contacted a second operator.I told him I was worried beacuse no e tickets.(dealing with other companys the e ticket normally turns up fairly quick),He checked everything and assured me dont worry  its all good,but if the tickets dont turn up in 2hr please contac me again..Of course nothing happened.I contacted you again asking for previoes operator only to be told hes gone home.Asked the third operator for my tckets .Now suddenly there was an extra fee of $150 Au .I argued that I should not pay it beacuse this was not a fault of mine.Then I was told I could get my money back.But suddenly things changed,and I should only gethalf my money back?The only options cancel and lose all my money or pay the extra fee.I decided to pay the fee and get on with life.I could have bought the same trip for about$600 now this cost me around $1300.Iwas told you try to ring me and emailed <http://me.my|me.my> phone didnt function well in Vietnam.There was only 1 email snt about 8am.Moral of this story is 1 you should have asked for my passport details when Ichanged my flight.  2you should have refunde all my money as this was clearly your mistake         3  a $600 trip turned into a$1300 trip.NEVER AGAIN
4	I had booked a flight Novosibirsk-Bangkok-Kualu Lumpur-Sidney via SkyPicker. Now I am in Australia and I can say that I'm satisfied with the service. The Support department especially, as they answered all my enquires by email and phone and managed to add the meal and baggage the hours before the flight.
5	She solved the problem very quickly. I am satisfactory . So I feel very good. She is the best!
5	it's really nice
1	I had the worst experience that someone could imagine from this company.Terrible conditions to see the details of the flights and I couldnt do the check in of my flight because of them. And I have need to pay 45 euros because of that thing!I just have a word : TERRIBLENever use this!
3	why u delet my comment
1	"Horrible and unreliable service!!! DO NOT BOOK HERE, that is what I can recommend!Booked for a friend MOW - DRS and MUC - MOW at the end of the year by Aeroflot and Ural Airlines for having a nice xmas and new years party. Price was 328 EUR all in. Yesterday the booking was completed successfully, the money went from my credit card and after 4 hours they have canceled the booking cause of technical problems. Okay, this can happen. Today I retried it once more and again booking completed successfully, money went from by credit card and after 4 hours of nothing I call them and they told me that they are still facing technial issues with the website but they will run my booking. I looked at skypickers homepage to track the status and there was a green light telling ""booking confirmed. I couldn't believe so I took a screen shot. 20 min later I received a message that the price have been increased to 637 EUR !!!, which means +200% or otherwise they will cancel my booking. THANK YOU FOR KEEPING ME BUSY 2 NIGHTS DOING THE BOOKING, RAISING UP THE PRICE 200% AND RUINING MY NEW YEARS CELEBRATION."

5	I wanted to thank you Milica who were very kind, helpful and patient with me and my hundred questions!
5	After getting a ticket, I've suddenly recognized that the name on it was incorrect (a typo letter). I sent a request via a customer service to update the name in the ticket. I was serviced by Bogdan, and the updated ticket's arrived a day after the request was open. In my case it's about 2 months before the flight so maybe it was a bit easy to change. BTW, I didn't pay any fee for this update. Would like to thank you much for your support and cooperation :)
1	The worst experience ever. When i was buying the ticket it was saying you might need a visa for UK and Paris. So, logically why would i need visa if i'm gonna just have layover. So, I purchased the ticket and then I received the e-ticket it was saying that VISAS FOR UK AND FRANCE are required. This is unbelievable!!!!!!! This is not the first time i travel through paris or London knowing that I always fight with multiple airlines!!!!!! I am not going to enter these countries. I just have layover.  My final destination is Tunis. Why the hell would I get visas within 24hours. PLUS it was  small notice in the website. It doesn't ask you like do you have schengen visa or not. This is insane. This untrustable website gave me only one option which is putting me in couple weeks in another flight plus I need to pay at least 900Euro.!!!! There is no refund option. Therefore, they stole more than 1300$. This huge scam will cost you a lot <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com>. STAYYYYY AWAAAAAY PEOPLE. THEY ARE PLAYING WITH PEOPLEeven when they comment saying that we'll investigate in this case and those kinf of stuff, they are lying. They did not even call me back when they said we'll try to find other options for you and call you in 4 hours.LIARS!!!!!!!!!
5	I forgot to check in online and was worried I had to check in at the airport. Then I noticed an icon for live chat. I tried it an got excellent service and check-in within minutes. Thank you!
5	Thank you for a greate customer service provided by agent Eleonora. She was super helpful, and solve my problem immediately.
4	Hana was really kind to help me. I am very pleased with her service. I look forward to my journey. Thank you.
1	Hi! I have book a ticket With u company but i have not got my ticket yet. How long dos it take? And will i get a ticket? Or is this a fake page? I have e-mail u but i havent get a answer?
1	We booked flights to Crete and made a mistake by chosingthe wrong date. When re-booking to the correct date - and accepting a second payment just as high as the first one - the system required several hours to process our date, only to come up with a booking that still carried the first (wrong) date. All this happened Sep 15 & Sep 16. Since then we are in discussions with Skypicker to get the booking corrected to the needed date - the date we know we used in the correction. There is no willingness at all to help. Skypicker is just shrugging their shoulder and cashing in without ANY service at all. They even refuse to have their data checked in their IT system which should show that typed in teh right dates.
1	"I bought tickets for my girlfriend to fly from Venezuela to Germany where I would pick her up. I received an email 2 hours later saying I needed to call to verify my payment method. When I called the customer service representative then respectfully told me it was most likely because the passenger name was different from the name on my card. I was then asked for additional information to verify my payment and told it will be fixed. I received another email saying it had been declined again. I made another phone call and told it was declined and they don't know why, and that because of their ""security"" system a purchase that has been declined twice Can longer be retried. I asked if there was anything I can do to fix it because these were the cheapest tickets I could find was told ""Our system is not very good but that's how it is"" and that any attempted purchase later with the same passenger name and card number would be declined. I can not begin to put in words at how frustrating it is to be told I can not see my girlfriend who I have not been able to see in 2 years because ""our system sucks""."
5	Everything smooth, as it should be, except that I did not receive all boarding passes for return trip on e-mail. Anyway, they were available on-line, so I downloaded them.I recommend this service to all my friends.
4	Kindly check with your financial department.
5	They gave the best offer, they were able to repair all the mistakes which I made during the order, they managed online check-in for me... I didn´t have to do anything and I didn´t pay much for it.
5	Very good service. I had the issue with the boarding pass not being sent in time to my e-mail address. Enri H. was very helpful and sorted this for me. Excellent assistance!
4	We had a flawless trip, everything was 100% clear and we immediately informed our friend-travellers about the very good choice we made.Thank you Skypicker!
4	Great customer service on the live chat from Tomas Jurik. Very helpful and went the extra mile.
5	Thank you to Julia for assistance with adding frequent flyer details to booking. Simple process and not a hassle. Thank you.
5	The online help was super fast and Lusine was amazing with me taking away all my doubts!!!
5	Excellent customer service! I received a new flight in less than 15 minutes.
5	This website planned every possible airlines for you to your desired destination. So far I didn't face any problem with all the airlines when going & coming back. Recommended to all people looking for budget airlines.
5	Excellent and fast service any time of the day, 24/7. Friendly personnel.
1	"I tried buying a ticket twice, as unfortunately best results on skyscanner come from skypicker. Both times the booking was cancelled after being ""processed"". The most important thing is in their email about booking processing they say ""No money will be taken out of your account until this is finalised."" yet the money has been taken out of my account both times! Completely unreliable service which charges you for the ticket they can not provide. I hope i will at least get my money back."
5	I was booked a ticket from Singapore to Auckland on 16/1/16. Before the booking confirmation, i decided to cancel the booking due to personal reason. I know Skypicker is having non refundable policy, but i still try to contact the customer service team. The customer service officer is helpful guide me through the booking cancellation process. After 2 hours, they are able to cancel my booking and will process the full refund to me. Thumb up! Will use your company service in future!
5	Dear Monika Snowden an Yulia Volova!I would like to express my thanks to Monika and Yulia, who helped me with the reimbursement of expenses incurred due to a mistake of Ryanair representative, who didn't allow my son (17 y.o.) to take flights Warsaw-Dublin-Birmingham. Ryanair informed the airpoprt service that a transit visa was required for taking these flights.After contacting airport services (officer of passport control), it turned out that the transit Ireland visa was not required for my son, but by that time the plain already left. So my son had to purchase another ticket to London and then spent 4.5 hours in 3 trains to get to Birmingam. Of course the price for these new tickets was higher than the initial tickets flight with Ryanair.Monika was the only one person, who listened to our problems attentively, then made a call to Dublin airport herself and return a call back to me with full details. She also advised me how to make a claim, understanding the situation and ....  in 3 days my son received a call from Yulia confirming that the full compensation for the extra expenses he paid was reimbursed by Skypicker!Thank you for all your help!We'll definitely use Skypicker for our future travel.RegardsJim Mojaev

5	Received a great and quick assistance for my problem in changing flights both through phone and emails. Highly recommending to everyone
5	Thank you very much Aura for the help. Appreciate that.
5	I couldn't find my boarding pass in the e-mail, so I looked for assistance. Natalya P. answered me and, quickly and really kindly solved my problem! Hope all you're staff is like her! I'll definitely book my flights with Skypicker again!
5	I am very satisfied with service at Kiwi! Takes no time for live chatting and this guy, Jiri, was extremely patient and hard working. Fixed all of my problems in no time! Haven't seen this from another airline. Full house of golden stars so far! Keep the good work up Kiwi!:)
5	They were quick to respond when I needed assistance on how to book on the website. Won't forget to thank Jonathan Eghan ..5 stars for you
5	I spoke with Mohammed from <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> and he was a real God send. My uncle and I were searching for sites for good airline tickets for hours upon hours and got absolutely nowhere. My uncle doesn't speak too much English, just Arabic so they connected him to an Arabic speaker. I mean no other sites have done that! They hang up or tell him to stop prank calling this number when my uncle calls and speaks Arabic. I've used lots of travel sites to travel back and forth for work and such all the time but I've never encountered one like <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>. Mohammed answered every question in a calm and informative manner, he didn't leave a single question unanswered. He even spoke well to my uncle before he handed the phone to me and I greatly appreciated that. <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> is definitely going to be my #1 pick from now on when it comes to travel. Mohammed was able to convince me within minutes that <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> was the best travel site among so many others. They have different languages, price drop alerts, coverage and the Kiwi guarantee, so many positives were specified. I'm totally sold, thanks Mohammed:)
5	Skypicker provided both the best prices and the best flight connections for our recent travels. When we had to alter our flights (which had already been booked and paid for) they not only answered our urgent phone call but dealt with our request very promptly and efficiently. Within an hour of contacting them they had emailed us with the information we needed. Thank you.
5	Eric was very helpful wen I called I appreciate his patience overall had a great experiance
5	i booked my flights today and the booking was very easy and also got a very helpfull phone call from Yulia K going through all the details in very efficient and friendly manner, well done kiwi. thanks.John
5	I spoke to Serhiy. I booked the wrong date. It took 2 minutes until he told me that he managed to cancel the booking. So I could book the correct flight and I can enjoy my holidays. Thank you very much. Serhiy was friendly and he found the best solution in less than 6 minutes.. GREAT
5	Lenka attention was really quick and helpful. Excellent customer service!!!!
5	Thank you Eric for a job well done and for calming my Nerves!!:grinning:
5	I contacted one of the agents here at <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> because I had some questions that needed to answer so I got to connect with this agent named Denis. He gave me enough time that I need and explained to me what I needed to know. I am very satisfied with his service and hopefully next time I get to connect with him again.

5	Youssef was a great help!
1	I bought a ticket through <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> and paid extra for a checked bag.When I went to the airline website, I found that there was a free bag allowance. Further, the airline offered 20 kg with the checked bag whereas <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> stated that 15 kg only was allowed. I was not able to get anyone on the phone and when I did a live chat, the representative told me that I agreed to the Terms and conditions and so now they cannot do anything about it. This is the first and the last time I will use <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>
3	If you need to contact Skypicker, online chat is the way to go.  Bek was great.  I tried to contact Skypicker via phone, couldn't get through, and via email, slow response.
5	Natalya not only changes passport number upon request but also corrected name typo. Great!
4	I booked my flights from Munich to Dublin with a stop in Brussel with back flight over the same route.After some weeks I got an e-mail saying that my bookings have been changed for the flight back and we would have to stay in Brussels over night. I have to say I was really angry about this so I opende the chat to get more acknowledge. When I first asked the agent Eszter B. about my flights she just wrote me without anything that the airline would cover the costs for my hotel!This is great I am so happy now because I booked a journey with my sister to Dublin and now we even have some time in Brussels free of charge!!!Thanks you so much Eszter! I am now really looking forward to my journey in July 2016. I can only recommend you guys to write or call the company with any issues they will help you the best they can!Best Regards,Becci R. :-)
5	Thank you for the smooth update of an incorrectly typed name. Quick and efficient, plus no extra fee.
4	Really thanks for helping and understanding me I was so nice service :blush:Hussain
1	"I booked my tickets from India to USA on 30th Oct,2016 via <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>. My date of travel was on 6th Nov from India. I got confirmation emails from <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> about my bookings. While going through the ticket details I realized the baggage policy in the ticket is not favorable to me. I immediately processed refund using ""Manage my booking"" tool on <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com>. I initiated return within 1 hour of my booking of tickets.  I got email from <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> that my refund is under process and it will take 10 days. Since I wanted to make sure my cancellation request is approved my <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> and at least acknowledged by <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> I contacted agent via live chat on the site. The agent assured refund will be taken care. I booked new travel ticket via airlines website.  Today I get an email from <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> the tickets are non-refundable and they cannot return my money. I have gone through all my email communications from <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> and nowhere it was mentioned during booking or after booking that the tickets are non-refundable. Even the agent I talked to on live chat didn't mention that the tickets are non-refundable. The tickets worth approx. $1600. This is very high amount for me. I am saddened by this experience with <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> and regret that I booked through them. I am exploring other options to claim my refund. I won’t recommend <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com>."
5	I forgot to check-in 72 hours before the flight. On the day of my flight I was immensly stressed about this, and eventually contacted them. 30 minutes later I had my boardingcards. They were so nice and helpful even though I was the wrongdoer. Thanks Skypicker!
2	After paying for our flights to Bali, I was shocked to see that it will cost $139 if I want to bring one 15 kg bag! I have already paid over $300 each for the flight, with only hand luggage included.Julie
5	Just wanted to say yours ChatClient staff really helped me a lot, and saved me a good night of sleep. Ondra, was really polite, and helpful. If all your team is like him, you are going in a good path.
4	@schommstar I can see that we've sent you boarding pass for Ryanair flight. I wanted to confirm if you have received. Thanks, Ian. Skypicker
4	Lukas Janecka has been a big help for me in correcting some mistakes I had introduced in my booking. Furthermore, he could give me the info I needed in a very short time.
5	The booking process was extremely smooth and thanks Theodore V, for making the modification process a breeze.
5	After I booked a flight and received the Eticket, I noticed I had made a typo with the passengers name.OOOHHH NOOOOO!!!I quickly called Skypicker to see if it could be corrected.I spoke with a consultant named Martin Pospisil.Not only was he Very polite, he Instantly made my worries dissipate, and got Right on to it, contacting the Airline to see what he could do.Within No Time, I received an email from Martin confirming he had corrected my ticket typo, and the process would be Free of Charge!EXCELLENT customer service, SPEEDY processing, and a Genuine Care for their customers!!Thank You Skypicker for having AWESOME staff!!Cheers Martin Pospisil (Y)
5	I has a few questions about the flyght and Mario Roth was very helpful. I hope kiwi's agents will remain like this. Thank you.
5	This is the first time I've used <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> and have to say - I was very surprised and will definitely be using them again.  The service and efficiency of both my booking and special request handled by Thomas Jurik was first class.  Thank you again.Kind regardsElena Ioannou
5	I want to say a big Thanx to Selorm for good service in the livechat tonight. So quickly and easely done,
5	User friendly website and all my travels went smoothly.
5	Luis k  who helps me is good worker ,cuz man solve my problem.i can take a board
5	The start of the flight was incorrect. Therefor i asked via chat  on the website of <http://KIWI.com|KIWI.com> to clarify. Even though my question was unclear, I was helped by Kostya, who patiently let me explain what the problem was. then Kostya investigated the matter and concluded that my etickets were not updated with the latest reschedule. By sending me the updated etickets we now can take the right flight. Thank You Kostya and KiWI for the quick response and solution via chat.
5	Kiwi has a weird habit of not letting you check in for RyanAir flights by itself but their customer service live representatives are excellent! Dorota helped me on the live chat, I provided her the details she asked for and within 10 minutes I had boarding passes ready to go
5	I called today with a lot of questions regarding my multiple itineraries with Kiwi and Babak went above and beyond to assist me.  He also did it with patience and kindness.  I will use Kiwi again for sure!
1	Agree with previous review all the good reviews sound fake.This company is little more than a scam. Asked to upgrade cabin baggage for flight with wizzair who charge £11.50 on their website and basically was told incorrect and misleading information meaning that this option was not available and I would need to check in luggage at a cost of £100! Do not be seduced by cheap prices as you will probably become victim to extra hidden costs oh and they refused to refund any money when I asked to cancel the ticket. Do yourself a favour and book with a proper company who won't rip you off!
5	I booked a ticket in skypicker and I made a mistake in entering the passenger details. I contacted the customer support through live chat and got an immediate prompt response from the person Ivana V. I am very happy with the service. I give full five star.
5	For low cost tickets, you need to deal with extras like seat reservations, luggage, etc...The flightpicker customer service responded promptly and reliably. In these times, when everyone is trying to screw the customer over with this and that hidden cost, and this and that empty promise - this service is worth a lot in my book!
2	I booked flights tickets for our family holiday last Summer with <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>. The ticket fare was supposed to be all inclusive but as we were about to board the plane back to the UK were asked to pay US$200 more for taxes. We tried to argue the case but with less than ten minutes left before take off we had no choice but to pay. We asked to be given receipts and were confident that Kiwi would reimburse once we got back home.  Soon after we arrived I wasted no time and contacted <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> to tell them about the charges.I explained everything to Monika and followed up with a comprehensive e-mail with receipts attached. I was told my query will be resolved within a day. Five days later Mario told me they had contacted the airline but he wanted me to tell them what the charges were for even though I had explained everything to Monika and submitted all the relevant receipts. In the end I provided <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> with the airline's telephone numbers with the hope that it will speed up things. Three months later I still have not been reimbursed the $200 which I should not have been charged in the first place as the tickets were meant to be inclusive of all charges and taxes. The last e-mail I received was two months ago from Petr saying they are still waiting to hear from the airline. I do not know why it is taking that long to make a phone call and get an explanation. In any case the refund of my money should not depend on that phone call as my transaction was with <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> who promised an all inclusive ticket. I have considered approaching the Financial Ombudsman over the issue but am not even sure whether <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> is a company resgistered in the UK.
5	i can just recommend <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com>. i got very fast help. very friendly stuff in the chat. thank you

1	For sure I will never use Skypicker again, nore will I recomend them to anyone. Did you know, that Skypicker has NO REFUND POLICY?? This means you can cancel your trip, but you CAN NOT get any money back.
5	Hi, I met mr. Josef on phone to clear a missing refund for my cancelled flight purchased via Kiwi. At the beginning I expected bit tough discussion to clear this issue because the issue happened about 6 months ago, but I was greatly treated with mr. Josef who showed a combination of professionalism, patience and eagerness to treat the situation correctly. You´re lucky to have such a person in your team. Karel Jezek
4	Had an issue and it was swiftly resolved by one of you, Barbora. She was so nice and helpful on the phone. Wish I could rate her 5 start!
2	"I booked my flight tonight with SkyPicker. I realized immediately after I confirmed that I may have made a mistake. I contacted the ""live agent"" messaging system right away to inquire about the parts where I may have made the mistake. I thought I was making myself quite clear about the information that I wanted, but the agent (who shall not be named here - she was very nice, it was just extremely frustrating if you're on the other end and need urgent answers) misunderstood my questions and failed to give me a straightforward answer. I began to inquire (important note: this was around 5 minutes after my booking confirmation) if I could cancel and start over. In the American flight booking system, it is standard to have a free cancellation policy for the first 24hrs. The agent told me that I cannot, but later her answer changed and told me it would be possible if my flights were not confirmed. By the time she told me this, it was almost half an hour after my booking. I checked my confirmation email, and it took 10 minutes for them to actually confirm my bookings... meaning that I DID have time to cancel my flights and book it again! Realizing that now was very frustrating as I have just spent over an hour messaging back and forth with the agent to try to figure out the complications from my original booking.Other than this colossal error, the agents were personal and friendly. I'm sorry it had to be such a negative experience. I'm hoping all of my complications will be resolved by Skypicker and that I won't have to waste any more time over this matter."
5	I'm so thankful to Mr. Mohamed your call center agent for a great service. His very helpful for me to retrieve my E ticket for my moms flight. I really appreciate  for your patience. God bless
5	I am so impressed with how your company handles clients and I was especially impressed with your manager Thomas Knox. He was very understanding and most importantly empathetic to my situation. He really listened to my case and I could tell immediately that I was in good hands. Even though I was the one one who made the mistake, Thomas understood my point of view and even assured me he would pass along my suggestions to make certain things more clear on your website. Thomas is a people person and that is the key ingredient to a great manager. If you are handing our promotions this year, I would suggest you seriously consider Thomas Knox who made my hectic experience into a reassuring one. I could not have been in better hands that day. I will definitely use your app in the future and I have already recommended it to several of my family members and friends.
4	So it was looking like a disaster when I got to the airport and my flight was cancelled. I had another two flights to catch after. The airline provider lion air had messed up and then put me on another flight and informed me I had to pay for another flight to get to my third flight on time. I contacted kiwi and they were very fast in responding and refunded my money after further investigation. Great cheap service and customer service was great!
4	I was directed to <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> by sky <http://scanner.net|scanner.net>. They provided me with the cheapest flight options for a multi airport journey. I managed to lose my confirmation emails and whilst the website manage my booking did not appear to be working I was able to get assistance from Aliaksandra through the live chat option. Much easier than waiting on hold for a telephone conversation.
1	If your flight gets cancelled and you want your flight agency to be really unhelpful and awkward about paying for new flights, then THIS is the company for you! Choose Skypicker. I would breakdown my rating for Skypicker in the following ways:Awkwardness - 5 starsHelpfulness - 1 starSmugness - 5 starsStubbornness - 5 starsComplete and utter disregard for reality - 5 starsBlackmailing skills - 2 starsThey tried to blackmail us into leaving them 5 star reviews but failed - nice try guys. Instead, they get a 1 star review. Congratulations, Skypicker. I hope you enjoy losing an entire wedding party worth of customers who were subjected to, or made aware of, your ridiculous treatment and policies.
5	Excellent servicefrom Vlada when I needed help with the boardingpasses for our trip.Just did it! Thank you
5	This has been the best travel booking service I have the pleasure of dealing with. I needed to cancel a sequence of 4 flights and Kiwi therefore quickly investigated the amounts for each of the 4 flights quickly and without hesitation. They answered my follow up question also very quickly and removed alot of stress from having to cancel the flights. I thank kiwi for highly valuing customer service in an industry where it can be very difficult to process cancellations. I would highly recommend Kiwi to anyone needing book flights online with confidence.

5	It was really lovely dealing with kiwi. The availability of customer service anytime with immediate response is really wonderful. Thanks kiwi
4	I booked the wrong flight and realized right away. I then contacted kiwi through their chat service. Sara Jurasova helped me and said there would be a 30 euro charge to cancel. On their website it says it's the law to give inbound flights 24hrs to cancel without a fee. So I was confused and asked if she could just switch me to the flight to the correct time since they offered both flights for the same price. She said she would have to contact spirit and see. While she was doing this I decided to call and I spoke to Adam Jelinek. He got my number and contacted spirit. Within 10 minutes he called back and said he was able to switch me to the correct flight with no charge or fees. He was very personable and understanding. What could have been a nightmare ending up in great hands of Adam and cantvthank him enough for fixing my mistake. Sara did email me back saying spirit didn't have an issue and saw the flight was fixed. I appreciated her following up with me. Although she should know the laws about canceling a flight. It all worked out in the end and was very happy with the help.
5	I appreciated the courtesy and great help received from Anna T.  I also must mention Andrea C. For subsequently completing my seat booking. It is really a relief for someone my age to be able to speak easily with someone who has patience in this age of racing through everything. Young people obviously can not remember the good old times of using travel agencies where you sat down and told the agent exactly what you wanted to do and left the office with your tickets, seating and everything solved. Well, Kiwi just gave me a taste of the past and it feels good! Thanks, Rachel
1	This companies practices are illegal in the United States. They admitted they do not place all their policies till after the no return payment. Additionally, told me its my fault if I can't transfer my luggage in time in 2 hours -- 1 of those hours being time that I had to be boarded.
5	I have just dealt with Miroslava on the chat forum and she/he has been so very helpful, efficient and courteous.  She dealt with my questions promptly and got my queries sorted.  I would rate her service at 5 stars.This is my first time using your company and I would most definitely use you again in the future.Many thanksJordan
5	Online chat really works.Great web platform, fast and efficient answer to a last-hour issue.I recommend.
1	"Originally I thought that this is your typical flight search tool so had no reason to avoid them when they offered reasonable prices for all of my flights within Australia.However, when I later had to deal with them over a problem with one of the flights then they wouldn't take responsibility or offer reimbursement / compensation.Long story short is that one of the domestic flights (not typically subject to any restrictions on liquids carried on board) had departed from an international terminal (thereby being subject to the limit on liquids). As such, I had to throw away my liquids.None of the info sent from <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> advised of this arrangement. I spoke to the airline who said that it is the responsibility of the party who sold the tickets to advise me of these details - that's <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com>.At first I called the company and then they told me to submit a claim form. Then I received a response advising my to take my issue up with the airline. After corresponding with the airline, I was then told to go back to <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com>! So I did and got told to refer to the T&Cs:""Article 6. Conditions of CarriageYou acknowledge that a Selected Carrier’s terms and conditions and conditions of carriage will unconditionally apply to Your contractual relationship with the Selected Carrier and that You must make Yourself aware of such terms and conditions as well as conditions of carriage before the Service Agreement is concluded and You complete the Booking."" The key point in the above extract is to ""make yourself aware"". This is a far cry from the likes of flight centre or any other high street travel agent who help you out with these things.I recommend to steer clear of this company."
5	Amazing and super helpful! Tomas U went the extra mile helping me out managing my booking. Very quick to reply all me queries and always providing options for my requests.totally recommend it :)Thanks again Tomas :)
5	I worked with Bogdan and he was wonderfully helpful! Very pleasant to work with and worked very quickly and efficiently, and followed up promptly on the issue we were working out.
5	Thank you Juan Costa, He did a grat job and in 2 minutes i have everything done.
4	I bought 3 tickets and everything worked smoothly and nice.+Trustworthy and reliable.+The service is very fast and they do consider about the customer.+They reply very soon especially via facebook.- They don't deliver digital boarding passports.
5	Thanks to Hana (my <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> host) an urgent problem with my boarding card could be solved in about 4 minutes. She makes me felt so comfortable and she was so professional and eficient.I hope I will not have a problem like this again but now i know Kiwi can solve it
4	"August 22 (Friday night) we missed the flight from London to Gothenburg because of delayed flight from Dublin. Got a very good help in the phone call (in both directions), got booked new tickets from another airport. Unfortunately, these tickets were not paid and we could not fly... (""It was misstake what never happens""). After several conversations we had to buy tickets for ourself (the only one in real what the airport pre-booked for us and kiwi had nothing else to buy). Sent into all documentation and got full refund for the tickets, shuttle and bus (got to fly to Stockholm - were no tickets to Scandinavia in the next 2 weeks).In the big picture very satisfied. Tickets price exceeded original price 7X and we got it paid. Definitely sense of security and will use Skypicker / Kiwi services again and ignore the mistake with ticket payment."
5	I was not able to add second baggage to my reservation, the chat guys (Jan Lukasek and Fahd Sidhoum) helped me during few minutes, contacted all the airlines and it was all arranged within a moment. Their fast action was appreciated.
5	I call to the customer service and Simon the agent very nice actitud , help me whit everything, friendly and efective !! He fix my problem and i am si happy ! Thanks a lot Simon

4	I booked a flight with Kiwi to later realize i can not check-in online for my flight and bag allowance shown on eticket is not accurate and confusing at best! So i checked the info with Tom on live chat and I found the chat very helpful. Thanks Tom
5	Flight was cancelled, but Nina and Nizar helped me perfectly to find another flight!! Excellent work!

5	I've been redirected to <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> from a larger fight search engine, and, I've accidentally booked the wrong flight times. Dimitriy from kiwi was able to secure my flight change at no extra cost and in a very short time. Brilliant!
5	Team member Lucie H assisted me with a change of Date for my flight. Very happy with the help she gave me. By far the best service I have had with dealing with booking agencies. A+++
5	I needed to change a name on my son's ticket because his middle name was on the passport but was not on the ticket! I wrote on the live chat and minutes later i had a confirmation that it was done. Thanks to Michal for his excellent work. Really great services. Thanks to all that works at <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com>
4	Lekena was very helpful.  I had not received my confirmation, she quickly determined my email address on file was incorrect & resent my confirmation.  She was great!The beginning of the chat box is automated, I had to re-enter things to many times & again when the (live) representative engaged the conversation.  That was annoying!!
5	Emre Tam Travel Consultant did very well and quickly in a short amount of time, just a few minutes after my call about the false nationality and it had been edited. Great work!
5	Thanks so much for helping me update my passport details on my reservation. It was quick and painless via their online chat. Wish all customer service could be like this :)Thanks!!!!
5	Very nice costumer service by phone, they had all the answers needed.
5	Last chance ticket.. Called Kiwi. A very nice and helpful lady, named Polina Mihhailova, took care of everything. Super smooth. Will definitely try to book again. Thanks!
5	Made the stupid mistake to book my flight on the wrong date. Made a call with <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> and a very professional guy called Vally helped me and changed everything for me to the right date. Super!! so happy! Thank you Vally, you have made my day
5	Big thanks for excellent service to Jiri - wish I could always have that experience with customer service!
1	I have a heart condition and my doctor told me after I booked my trip that I can no longer travel. In an already horrible situation for me, I reached out to Skypicker to get a refund, and they won't refund me, even with a doctor's note. In 2016, I would hope that companies know how much competition there is out there and that $461 dollars back to a customer is going to help them more in the long run than having no sympathy and being money-hungry. So disappointing.
4	Once I was past the bot response I got a hold of Miroslav.  That guy should get a medal - prompt response and friendly. Helped me out bigtime. No five stars because of the annoying autobot which gave irrelevant info. No hesitations to book through <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> in the future.
5	Our payment had been denied and instead of loosing our flight, I call them they try the payment again and not only everything was solved but they Zdenka also called me back, at the time arranged, to guarantee all was well!Amazing costumer service.Thank you loads!
4	Kiwi can't be beat for cheap flights that may have some re-checking bags/switching carriers on layovers.  Pretty solid, very cheap.
5	Thanks so much to Jan Lukasek for helping me out with my many questions! he was a great help and I could tell that he is eager to provide great customer service and cares about his customer's experiences.I have not taken my booked flight yet but so far I am extremely pleased with the service and wouldn't hesitate to book again based on my current experience.Thanks!- Kira
5	Had been given a seat on a Ryan Air flight (33A) which I thought was a bad seat - so called up Customer server. Spoke to a great guy called Sam.A who helped me get a better seat on the other flights as it wasn't possible to amend the first flight. Had 33A again on my homebound flight - which was actually quite a good seat and will try to get it again! Anyway - 5 stars to Sam for his great attitude and helpfulness.
5	I want to say: their help was as like how it's they can fly: Very high.Good company, with nice price list. Thank you Kiwi.

5	Had to ask about my son going back from Porto - and they had to fligh to Brussel -  Mohamed Abdelkader helped me in a very proffesional way - thank you.
5	I was concerned about my reservation being paid for and used the chat service to ask some questions about my reservation. Enri was very quick and very clear with his help. Best service I have EVER gotten online that quickly.Thanks Enri
5	I had doubts regarding <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> after reading some reviews. However, I was more than pleased with the choice of flights they offered and with the prices. I flew half of globe (from Ukraine to Japan), changed flights 3 times. I was lucky in Stockholm - the officer checked me in for all the next flights and gave me the window sits. I did not have the experience with luggage check in - check out - with hand luggage I did not have any problems. In addition, I was happy that meals were provided on the flights, I did not know they will be. Well done, <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com>!
5	After 3 successful orders - and actual flights, I was ordering the tickets for my next trip. Unfortunately, I mistyped the email address and did not get any confirmation to my inbox. I had to talk to the customer care and a great guy named Dmitriy Malitskiy sorted the issue in 2 minutes.Frustration-free and the most cheap online ticketing service ever. Keep the good work!
5	The experiences I made with <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> were really good. The website was easy to use and I received confirmations and other details immediately. Also the the 24/7 telefone service was very good and gratifying. Betya answered all my questions and is a pleasant person!
1	Accidentally booked the wrong date for a flight (misread) called within minutes of clicking and was told I had to pay to change it. Since it was important that I be in Barcelona a certain day I had to pay the fee. It was my mistake. Changing it was a huge process (they took the money quickly though) and now I am at the airport waiting for a flight that has been rescheduled 6.5 hours later with no notice. I get that things happen. I called customer service and it was a terrible experience. The agent was rude and condescending. When I said having no notice of a schedule change was unacceptable she laughed and told me that it happens. (Excellent empathy...) and then proceeded to tell me that she saw on her end that the flight was still scheduled for 410 am. Am I to take that as I am lying? Maybe she should check the website of the carrier which it is updated on before commenting. If kiwi wasn't notified ok that's fine. But customer service agents should be able to, at the very least, not make a extra 6.5 hours at the airport even more painful.
5	Thank you Ondra Pohl for helping me today with checking in online even though I should have done it two days ago you still found a way to help me! I would have paid 45 pounds if it wasn't for you. Very kind and helpful.

5	Had never heard of the company, but thanks to <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> I booked a last minute flight to my destination when Easyjet cancelled my flight. Payment etc. was handled fine. First leg issues with a boarding card, had to fully check in to the second leg with an e-ticket. Had time to do so. Price was fair, the route was a bit crazy, but I was glad to find the flight and thankful to find <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com>. I will keep them as an option for the future.
5	Thank you Daniel Peter for solving my query within few seconds.
5	Great service and quick response, really friendly and helpfull, the agent Katerina did a great job helping me solve my questions and problems, thanks again Katerina!!

5	Such a great staff helped me out when my flight got nearly three hours delayed, in the space of an hour and in a foreign airport I was quickly assigned a new, more convenient flight time by a friendly and courteous staff that understood my concerns. Would recommend ten times over. Thanks so much to Zuzana, Michaela and Ali for helping me with getting me out of dire straits.
5	The agent Tereza was amazing, super helpful and kind.
5	Skypicker is the number one for me in searching for flights thanks to interactive map and good overview of where to go for the best prices.Unfortunately I encountered a problem paying for a ticket but Tomas Krivanek on support was fast and helpful with resolving it. Overall thumbs up! :)
1	"I recently bought a flight with Skypicker, it was cheap and I was very happy with this company for the cheap flight they offered me. $618 Kathmandu, Nepal to Sydney, Australia.However, I made a mistake with my flight, and booked and paid for the wrong date back from Kathmandu. And that date I did book for was right in the middle of Everest Base camp trek. I realised this within minutes of my booking and looking at my trek itinerary. At that point, I freaked out, because I read the terms and conditions and read this company had a no-refund policy, which I understand. I then rang up to see If i could change my flight and the nice customer service representative told me that the replacement flight fee would actually be more expensive than going and buying a separate flight myself from AirAsia directly. I really appreciated her honesty and then hung up the phone.I then accepted my fate that I had lost the money and to move on, I then checked my transactions online and saw that the payment was under 'pending transactions' and thought that this could be interesting. So I rang Skypicker back up and talked to a male this time, a polite, well spoken gentlemen. I told him about this pending transaction and he said that it means that his company hasn't accepted the money through on their behalf yet and that it was still in the 'holding' phase and that it could be very possible for them to just send it back knowing that I definitely can't use the flight. He, however said, that he would put it in the system and then wait for the finance department to 'decide' whether they would accept the money or not. I questioned him on this, asking what he meant by decide, and he said that they could decide to just send the money back and that's where the 'automatic' system ends, at their computers. I thanked him over and over for this and he told me he would call me within 30 minutes and let me know what happened. During this time I got sent my 'confirmation' email from Skypicker, which i thought was strange cause I had rang him twice to cancel the booking. After an hour I rang him and talked to another employee who said that they had tried to call me but must of had the wrong number, and we checked the number and confirmed that it was the right one.They then said that the money couldn't be sent back and that the transaction was already complete. I was so confused as the previous employee had told me other wise. I then spoke to the manager but he just kept saying ""it was in the terms and conditions"", and I pleaded with him to help me on some level, somehow as I had just lost almost a whole weeks worth of pay, he said he could transfer me to another flight and I said ""with that money i already used?"" and he said ""no that money is gone"". I explained over and over how I could see on my computer that it was still in the 'pending transactions' part but he just kept saying theres nothing he could do.I then hung up and rang my bank St George, where she said that the money is still there and just waiting for Skypicker to accept it, and because the purchase is over $500 there is nothing I can do to get it back without Skyjackers consent.So, the money has't charged yet like the manager told me, yet they are refusing to let go of the money for a product they know I can't use and have now even cancelled. Like, they don't even have the money yet and they KNOW that I can't use the product at all and it it's no cancelled, doesn't it seem fair to just not accept the money and let it come back into my account??I understand that this was all based on my mistake, but the the manager of this company had no initiative to help and just expected me to accept the loss of all this money and then pay for another flight, after his employee said that I could get the money back. this was a pretty emotional couple of hours for me and just more proof of big commercial companies not caring about the individual.Sorry readers about the huge rant, this has just upset me a lot and I wish Skypicker would just be a little more helpful considering the large sums of money. Although thank you to the employee who did obviously break the theme of ""it's all about getting as much money as possible"" and try to help me."
3	@IATA @skypickercom EXtra over and above airline charges. Using altered booking passenger contact information. Such as email and contact no.
5	Easy-to-use platform, excellent costumer support, outstanding low fares flights matchmaker!My favourite flight booker, will book again for sure.I'll recommend it to everyone.
5	"Since I discovered it 1 and half year ago, I can't stop using it.Low prices, no ""hidden prices"", interactive world map (so useful !), and booking extremely simple. Because of these 4 main things, <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> became the only tool I use for all my travels.And guess what ? I have never been disappointed. Thank you to all <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> team to have made such a nice website."
4	I am very pleased with one of the staff Lucie Polivkova. She was very patient and helpful. Answered all my questions and sorted out my issues with my daughter`s fly. Thank you very much, Lucie. You are doing a great job! Well done!
5	Thanks very much to Alan who has been assertive and helpful in dealing with my query tonight. He has helped me sort out my booking and confirmed everything I needed dealing with.
4	Thank you Daniele for your quick phone and e-mail support today. You moved very quickly the checked in luggage to my boarding pass from the one of the person traveling with me, which was very helpful for us!
5	La migliore applicazione per la ricerca e prenotazione voli,  è dotata di tools che permettono la ricerca tramite nazione,  raggio geografico,  intervallo di date ed altro.  È possibile prenotare tramite skypicker e al check in ci pensano loro.  Anche l'assistenza tramite chat è molto efficiente.
4	Discount airfare site Skypicker offers travelers new ways to find cheap flights <https://t.co/X2nHLtP1B3>
5	Foram muito eficientes e gentis!Recomendo!
1	I would give this company negative stars if there was an option. Skypicker - please dont even bother responding to this review - the damage is done. I will make it my priority to advise the world against your terrible services until you are out of business or you change your name to start scamming under another alias.
5	Thank you so much Monika!! You're the best!! Me and my friend  have booked ticket from <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> Shall I made some mistakes.I had to call to kiwi call center and was rescued from her. But while she helped me, the connection is lost and she tried to call me back and help me done with information ;)
5	Ich kann nur gratulieren den Mitarbeitern der Kiwi schnell und hilfsbereit in allen DingenTeona half mir in allem habe ich nicht verstandensehr edel Team
5	ANASTASIA WAS GREAT AND PLEASANT WITH A LOT OF PATIENT.
5	Had a problem with passport details so i decided to use the online chat to find some help. Veronika was extremely helpful and sorted out the issue within a couple of minutes. Very friendly and very quick to help me out.Will 100% use kiwi again because of this!
5	Great customer service and James went out of his way to solve any issues...Thx guys keep up the good workWill Alpers
5	Molto cortese e gentile nel rispondere in modo celere alla mia richiesta di prenotazione volo, spero che siano tutte come Eleonora C, ottima assistente viaggi.
5	I was a bit skeptical and nervous about using Skypicker based on the mixed reviews I've read but I ended up purchasing a ticket from JFK to AMS. I had to connect on OSL on my flight to AMS and then CPH on my way back to JFK and everything went super smoothly! Skypicker emailed me each day before my flights and said I had to check in at the airport but I was able to use their confirmation code that they sent and check in to both SAS and Norwegian Air beforehand and get my boarding passes sent directly to my. Super easy! If you're thinking of using Skypicker myonly tip is to make sure there is plenty of time between your flights because if there are any delays that could make your trip super stressful if you missed a flight. You have to de-board and get your baggage if you checked then recheck in through security for your second flight so it takes time to do all that so delays can make it cutting way too close. Oh, and I suggest buying the baggage beforehand. I did that and I had no hidden fees for anything! Thanks Skypicker I got to go see my little sister and not break the bank!
4	The initial Skypicker process (found through Kayak) was normal, and the low or non-existent booking fees were a nice change from some sites. The customer service was also very prompt in correcting an error made when I entered my travel document information.The one downside was the much higher price to pay for checked luggage with Ryanair using Skypicker (as you can't access Skypicker bookings through the actual Ryanair site) - €44 per bag instead of €15 (the online Ryanair price)!
5	five stars to the online service of the  kiwicom great job  very quick very good ,so simple miss tanya hi five nice job  you make my day ,keep that way
4	The online process was easy but not the cheapest one. I had no problems with the online check in. Overall a good experience. I would improve the online platform to be more user friendly.
5	Fantastic service Simon, thank you so much!
4	I was in SKYPICKER for flight and fare proposal,An excellent and very reactive assistance done by Aurelija and Ondra to adjust my booking The answers were very clear and in line with my expectationsI appreciated!
1	They will take care of your money and you'll have no powers what happens next. They deal with the airlines. If you need to change a flight they'll simply sell you a new flight instead. Double paying it's called. Never again. They are von artists!
5	Thank Olga for a quick respond. It was very helpful and I appreciated such approach!
1	Seriously Skypicker?? I booked a flight through you guys on VivaColombia (Booking 869455) and was sent an email from you guys saying my boarding pass is ready for printing. Well, I went ahead to print it out, found out that it's actually an e-ticket with a fine print saying that this flight can only be checked in at the airport counter. So I did that and VivaColombia slapped me with a US$15 charge because it's an additional service when it's totally no fault of mine??? And according to them you guys should have checked in for me, informed me of this additional charge, which I had never heard of from you. Too many hidden charges which is no fault of the customer but the customer ends us paying for your HIDDEN INFORMATION. This is way unprofessional!!!
4	I encounter a problem while flying from Mexico City to Cancun with the local airline, when I called the called center the answer was quick, and after a couple of days I got a refund for a flight I had to pay. Skypicker always replied messages and in the end the problem was solved satisfactory. I would use their service again and recommend it to other people.
5	Very satisfied with this service, the agent was fast at rectifying a problem my friend accidentally made when booking.I have already started to recommend this service.
5	Thank you Tomas Jurik for processing my booking soooo quickly so my son could get on a last minute flight.  Thank you also for calling me to advise that it was all done.  Thank you!
4	My first time buying tickets with Kiwi. Prices was good and also the service when I contacted them.
5	Got nice experience in planning and booking with skypicker. Thanks Miquel for online support and dealing with all questions related to my booking payment.
2	I will not give the lowest rating (Poor), because the initial booking process was good, BUT then I had to change one of the departures on the itinary, that started out as a good experience as well, but ended up as a bad experience. Basically they gave me a price by email for the change, which I immediately accepted by replying to the email, the problem is that they didn't send me the payment link to pay for the change until the next day, well I paid the change fee, then they called me back and said the price for the change had just gone up by 129 EUR because the tickets had now gone up in price, complained and the supervisor got involved, the message from the supervisor was that there was nothing they could do so I had to pay the additional 129 EUR. All this happened while I was on the phone with them, so I agreed to pay the additional 129 EUR right there and asked if I could be sure that there would not be an additional price on top of that, they said they couldn't guarantee that because the price could have gone up while we were speaking, I was on the phone with them for more than an hour and they even told me that they booked and confirmed the first leg of the flight first and then I had to wait for them to get confirmation on the connecting flight (I don't even want to think about what the situation would have been if the connecting flight in the meantime had become not available) it did end up though that the price stayed at the additional 129 EUR. I have been doing a LOT of travelling and therefore booking with different agents, so I know that a professional agent will find the flights, tell you the price and be able to hold them while you speak to them, if you agree they will finish the booking. Apparently skypicker don't have the option to do that, so all they are is a middle man that you tell where you want to go and they find the flights for you, and then hopefully if you agree the flights are still available for the price they quoted you. Anybody can do that themselves, so I see no advantage in using them for that.With that said, the people I talked to was nice and helpful, but I do feel ripped off by the additional 129 EUR, which was their fault because they let a day go by between giving me a price and giving me the option to pay.
5	I received help from Sara with a booking issue from a typo I had made during the actually booking. She was extremely helpful and sorted out the problem with speed and efficiency. Michael
5	Big gratitude to the team of Katerina, Daniel and Daria who so quickly in the last minute did seems very small thing (changing baggage from one person to another ) but very important for us, what show us that this team is taking care with all heart not depending who you are, how much money you have and size of your problem. You are amazing and i would like to continue co-operate with you in the future. Much love :)
5	Mr. Tamer I thank the wonderful people and the best technical support in the world portion
5	I have a problem with the boarding pass, I explained my problem on the Skypicker Chat and in just 10 minutes the problem was solved.
5	Most important thing is ofcourse reliability in taking care of booking and paying process. But what can make difference between firms is what happens when a customer has questions or requests. Skypicker has excellent assistans you can live chat with. They find the answers. Also they answer your emails immediately. I felt safe during my trip to exotic South East Asia countries.
1	I've bought a Ryanair flight and there is no possibility to check-in online by myself... They claimed I will have to buy another ticket on Ryanair site to do so, because there is only possibility that they will make check in for me. But I would like to have control on it and this is really strange that I am not able to check in by myself as in other similar sites...Better avoid unless they will change their stupid rules.
4	There was a problem with my booking as I hadn't received the confirmation but with a simple call they were quick to help. Their efficiency is much appreciated. And the fact that the helpline employee was sweet is an added bonus.
5	Sent an email to skypicker support and reply was received within 1 hour and my problem was resolved with no issues.
1	NOT RECOMMENDED.....
1	Its a shitty company that you assume is the same as other  companies but cheaper but u only find out it is the complete shit compared to every other option and it is complete shit
4	So far so good! We are ready to leave for our holiday on Tuesday and I just used <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>'s Live chat. Ondra helped me out with my questions rather quickly. We are booked on two Ryanair-flights and need to make an internet check-in. Kiwi will do that for us and send us the boarding passes 7 days ahead. Otherwise it'll cost us a Ryanair-fare. Thanks to Ondra we got all of that sorted out! :o)
5	I made a typing mistake with my email address when booking online with <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> but didn't notice.  I just received an email from Mario telling me he had picked up the mistake and corrected so I would receive my e-ticket.  Without him doing that I would having to be spending time chasing my e-ticket email.  Thank you so much Mario.  You're  real asset to the company.
5	I used the chat option and spoke to Hana to advised that I may need to change my flights. Hana responded quickly and directed me to the 'Manage your booking' page where you can change your flights. Hana talked through how to access the change of flight options and afterwards arrange for an email to be sent to me by the airline with the options and prices.
5	It was very fast contact with me few minutes after my booking, I got everything without any problems, they did everything for me. I strongly Reccomended!
5	I had some problems with my check in and Yurri N was the best help ever. Thanks Yurri
1	I can't believe what a scam this company is! I had saved up months to buy my dad a ticket and when I was booking my computer filled in my FIRST name  incorrect (only the first name all the other information is correct) and after I realised I emailed them immediately, only to get the response 'you have to buy a new ticket'.... 2 min it would be for them to change the name, 3 weeks of full time work it would take me to buy another one. I am infuriated. I will NEVER book through this company again, it is an absolute disgrace to the human race.
4	sai tres dificile de me conecte a kiwi
5	Don't book  <http://skypicker.com|skypicker.com>  . I lost balance from my card without any reason.  If you enter your card details in <http://skypicker.com|skypicker.com> site ,they will save the card details and you will lost money from acvount any time. 100 % sure . Please don't go with them ..
3	I am not completely satisfied by the Kiwi company. For what my concern,  5 hours before the boarding I did not get the boarding pass yet, thus I called the assistance. The italian service perhaps was still sleeping, not available at 7.30am. Instead the English service was really kind and provide the right support in very excellent way. The issue was related to the passport number, nobody informed me till iI called the assistance.
5	Had a minor issue regarding online check-in and wanted to avoid the extra costs at the airport. Sena was awesome and fixed my problem in less than 5 mins. Professional and straight forward service, just what you want!
5	The service of help is so nice and Elsa C too.

5	Exellent suppor by LENKA
4	When I realized I have to upgrade my baggage allowance, I contacted Kiwi and got a quick answer on the chat and later on the phone. Josef E had to work hard to get what I needed on time from VietJet and called me twice on the phone to inform me. Thanks Josef!
5	Customers service couldn't be better! I made a mistake with my reservation, so I tried to solve it throught the Chat Service. That was quick and so easy!! An agent called Alan was really kind and helpful, he changed my reservation details for me. I can only recommend Skypicker.
3	Wayne give you the reservation number
4	<http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> allows you to mix and match different flights beyond airline alliances. Their customer service has been really supportive in handling custom add-ons. Recommended!!!
5	She is nice and I appreciate that she do for me

2	We had our flights cancelled from Bogota to San Andres and have spent several days trying to contact them to arrange a refund. They have shockingly bad service with the online chat  leaving you with no one replying and the UK contact number which they provide getting redirected to a Vodafone mobile of someone who has never even heard of <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>!It is not worth the hassle booking with this company. Such a shame as the booking was really easy but when you really need the support there is no one available to help!
5	I would like to thank Simon from the service center for a really fast and good service. He fixed my passport details, so I could get my boarding passes.
4	I received good help from the Kiwi chat service, by operator Lucie F. She was very helpful solving my problems.
5	The service was exceptional. Very professional, friendly and efficient. I was really impressed! Use them, they are fabulous!:heart:

5	Had the good fortune to be helped in straightening out my plans with the Chat Representative: OndraA delightful and knowleadgeable employeeKeep up the good work skypicker
1	I was really unhappy with this travel agency, and I had problem with my booking. Indeed it was impossible to make the check in online, without luggages I loose 6 hours of my hollydays dealing with the chek in in the airport !!! I send 2 email in avdance in order to ask how to make the ckeck in online , the only answer was to send a request to the support, but without answer after 2 emails,and after contacting several times the online support,  I have to given up. Therefore the worst is to come, as we were unable to make the check in online and to contact skypicker, and as my information wasn't send by skypicker to ryanair I had to pay 90€ of checkin instead of nothing if they had send the information !!!!!
5	Had a slight mistake in my reservation and I was promptly helped by Mr. Luís Silva. Very helpful and friendly. Would recommend.
5	Tomas was very sweet, patience & police THANK YOU!
1	I've had the most horrific experience with this company.  I booked 7 tickets for a month long trip in one day, all in July.  I booked a ticket from Victoria Falls to Cape Town via Johannesburg for JULY 17-22.  I then received an email from <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> saying that they were experiencing technical difficulties and that I would have to wait some time for my flights to be confirmed.  A full 24 hours later I received a confirmation email stating that my flights had been confirmed for JUNE 17-22.  An entire month earlier than I had booked for!  I called immediately, no more than 5 minutes after receiving the confirmation, and the agent told me that since the tickets had been confirmed there was nothing I could do short of paying a fee nearly equal to the original cost of the tickets to change the date.  The agent said that she would have the IT department check to see what happened.  Well, OF COURSE the IT department said that it was not their responsibility, despite the fact that I had sent them screen shots of my original search showing that I had selected July 17-22.I am a small business owner that donates a part of all of my profit to foundations around the world and this is my first sourcing trip.  Having to buy a whole new ticket because of someone else's mistake is a huge issue and is causing me a lot of setback.The fact that <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> clearly made a mistake, and that I have proof showing it, and they still want me to pay for their mistake is absolutely ridiculous.  I have flown all over the world and never in my life experienced customer service this bad.  I should have trusted their bad score on <http://trustpilot.com|trustpilot.com> and never booked with this company in the first place.  I can assure you that I, nor any of my 6000k+ online followers looking to me for travel recommendations, will ever use this company again.
5	excellent customer service...Tamara help me a lot,keep the good work.

5	I needed to upgrade my baggage with Whizzair and they helped me to do that and sent me my boarding passes. They did the online check-in for me, so it was very easy and all I had to do was print it. I had no issues in any of the airports and I flew through three major cities.
5	Just enjoy the trip!
5	I used Skypicker for the first time in September 2015. I was a little bit concerned because I read some negative reviews, however in my case everything went as promised.Thanks to Skypicker I was able to fly roundtrip from Seoul, Korea to Sydney, Australia almost 60% cheaper than other websites, and with just 1 connection.I really recommend everybody to use Skypicker, and myself of course I will use it for my future trips.
5	I was really upset that I would have to pay $145 per bag for one of my trips, but Noah was able to work a miracle. It was difficult for both of us, but after a an hour or so, we were able to find a way to pay $77 for both of my bags! He was so terrific and patient. Best experience with an Airlines agent answering a concern of mine. Thank you so much, Noah!
5	thank you skypicker!!!! u made my journey awesome.....and thanks Anri A for helping me decide flights.....:)
5	I had difficulty in getting a seat for our flight to Osaka.  Thanks a lot to TOMAS KRIVANEK and ALINA BERNATSKA, who made it a lot easier.  Their response were quick and extended excellent assistance and provided sufficient guidance for us to complete our requirement.  I would like to extend my commendation to both TOMAS and ALINA for their professionalism and outstanding customer service.
5	"I would like to share my positive interaction with the company's representatives, in providing detailed information about my flight details. I would like to praise one in particular, named Anastassia, which was very professional, patient, and sympathetic, to all that was asked of her via Chat Message Service. I would've otherwise have to way a further 20 days before I would get any response via email to my ""refund application form"".Excellent service, excellent professional, highly recommend! * * * * *"
5	Lot of really nice deals and a customer care representative was able to answer me around 2:26am in less than 1min and for forget to mention Tomáš Mužík was really helpful
1	I booked three flights with <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com>, a few days before the first departure. <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> confirmed them before sending me a second email asking me to verify my credit card information. I called and had a useless long talk with an operator who asked me multiple questions about my credit card and my payment to check that it wasn't a stolen card. Apparently despite the veracity of my information and the fact that it was indeed MY valid credit card they decided to cancel my reservation without further details. Of course, as expected in the mean time the prices had gone up. Whether it's a scam to get people to pay more or it's a stupid administrative error, this absolutely convinced me NEVER to use this website again, and I'll be sure to tell as many people as possible.
4	My first booking experience with Kiwi was flawless. After booking, I wanted to make changes to my account (not the itinerary) and Peter Hrnciar was very helpful, willing to look for the right solution. He may not all the solutions at his fingertips, but he was going above and beyond to find the right answer, offer options, and did follow up via email.
5	profesional sevice.thanks to michaela o
5	Big thanks to Michal for a profesional service.
5	No problem there, good service and great website. Overall very good
4	They have a good customer service, They are so helpful, specially Angelika.
4	I just booked a flight from Stockholm (NYO) to Gdansk and appreciated the good price! It was also very easy to book. However, I realized that the NYO airport was quite far from Stockholm, which I should have checked before booking, but which will make it difficult for me to make the flight on the date booked. I contacted customer chat and they responded quickly. Unfortunately, it was not possible to cancel the purchase, even though it was done within - let´s say - max 15-20 minutes. This is contrary to i.e. Norwegian air which lets you cancel within 24 hrs, even though the ticket is non-refundable. This part was therefore a dissappointment. The customer service person, JAMES, was, however, very friendly and did check these things for me in a very timely and friendly fashion. He certainly did what he could to help me, and will also get back with me through mail if there are any alternatives. He certainly is doing a great job!
4	The system was a bit slow and I didn't receive any confirmation email. I tried to call, and they said they would call back, which they never did. So I tried to contact them on the chat, where I got a hold of them. And through Dominika, it went from being a bad experience to a good one.
1	I had the worst experience with this company. EVER!Never had i had so many problems to go back home from Turkey...When i opend my mailbox there were always a mail from them, abouth that there have been some chances and one of my fligt were cancelt and I should contact the flight company - not Kiwi, but me! 10 hours flight tranport just to go back to Copenhagen (normal 3,5 hour flight) First from Konya (cancel) instead from konya i took from Antalya, to Istanbul, and then to Bonn and then Köln...(Köln was the worst place i ever had! No help at all!) Sorry KIWI but I will never use you anymore!!
5	Sam called me the other night to help me make sure I had everything I needed for my flight after I submitted a request for a change online.  What a pleasant surprise and wonderful customer service experience.  Thank you!
4	Thank you for great custumer service at all time in the day! The answers from your chat is perfect! I get directly answer from you!
4	Skypicker's customer support is fast and efficient. Had some issues on the boarding passes and the support team is clear with their instructions. Would definitely book with skypicker again in the future.
5	I had a counseling with Barbara Kubešová.I reserved 5 multi-destination flight tickets and among them, I was wondering about 1 ticket's check-in procedures. So I asked it to her if it is okay to check-in at the airport directly, and she tried her best to solve my problem with checking airlines for a whole day. She was very very kind and nice and I really appreciate for your perfect service. Thank you very much
5	I was need to get a wheelchair on board, so i write to Skypicker then Ivana V helped me so much. Perfect service, I get there. Off cause they need a lot of information, but that was not a problem. They answer me fast. And my English it's really bad, but she was really friendly, and helpfully.
5	My flight from Bali to Cairns was re scheduled due to volcanic ash. The alternative flight service that Jetstar offered me was not great however I spoke with Alexandra L via Skypickers online chat service. Alexandra was very attentive and understood my concerns and was able to reschedule me for a flight that suited my travelling much better. I would recommend.
1	"Avoid buying tickets from here. I can't imagine this company will last for long. I booked a flight with my husband (at the same time mind you) and they managed to only book his flight, not mine, which makes no sense. In a panic, we called their customer service number and they said they had a ""technical issue"". How comforting. But it gets worse. Their solution: to have me to pay for another ticket myself and they would reimburse me for the cost. Well let me tell you, 2 months later it's still not resolved. I'm constantly having to follow up with their customer service desk. As we were dealing with multiple currencies (SEK, EUR, USD), they chose a rate that was extremely favorable to them. I'm telling you. They always respond with a vague ""I'm so sorry... please contact us if you have any questions or concerns"". It's like I'm talking to a robot.  They obviously aren't sorry, or else they would do something about it."
4	Hi, as it turns out I was just too late to fill in additional info so that skypicker could perform my online check in. I just called their customer service and got help directly over the phone by Babak who was very friendly and helped me even tho Im pretty sure I already passed the deadline! BIG thanks, very good service and superkind attitude! HAPPY COSTUMER =)
1	I, my mother, and my sister travelled with Ryanair trough Skypicker on the 29th of October, going from Copenhagen to Dublin and then from Dublin to Glasgow to see the 2015 World Gymnastics Championship, so alot was depending on our flight there. We get our boardingpasses as planned, print them, and head to the airport on the 29th - only to discover that our outbound flight has been moved to 20:00 instead of 10:20, which would not only make us miss our connecting flight, but also Worlds. On our printet boardingpass it does say that departure time is 20:00, but in the mail it says 10:20 - and by what I can read in the disclaimer, we are supposed to contact Skypicker, if we find any mistakes (which is somewhat understandable). But this was an actual move of our flight, so that makes it skypickers responsibility to tell us. We ended up paying an additional 15.056 kr. to get 'last minute-tickets' with SAS.Afterwards I contacted Skypicker (who was very friendly), and they ended up refunding us 1,957 kr, because we as travellers have to contact their customer service if we find that their is any problems. Although that is fair I still cannot see how they could have done it any differently. We got the absolut last tickets to Dublin in the entire airport, so unless they would have provided us with another plane, I cannot see how they would have done it any diffrent. As I said, very sweet people, but a very disappointing outcome. Will by no means travel with Skypicker again.
5	My experience with <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> was great. I am very satisfied and especially with their customer support. I had to renew my passport, while on round trip, and I connected customer support for an update of my info. They solved it within a day even it was a weekend. I highly recommend this company.
5	skypicker is very good and I really like and really sings with you  i am very happyabdallah benamar
5	Alice W. was a great help! Thank you..
4	Ira V. provided adequate support when I need information about the flights, baggage allowance and emergency contact.
5	Kiwi made my booking the easiest most efficient trip I've ever had to book. I did a multi booking trip that consisted of 4 different airports and kiwi allowed me to book it straight through them instead of individual airline sites. I loved the simple process and website design and will definitely be using kiwi again for future bookings.
5	I am really impressed from <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> prices, website and staff. The live chat seems to work very well and the staff create a cozy atmosphere giving quick answers in our requests. I would like to especially thank Jan and Pavel for their friendliness, kindness and their excellent support! Good job!
5	I had good support chat from Enri but unfortunately the outcome was not what I was after - that was on the airline end though, apparently.good service, good support.  will use again.
5	Skypicker has less rates and best service of ticketing. You don't need to be experienced in online ticket buying, the system directs you within every step and avoids you to make mistakes. System warns and mails you if your reservation has a missed information like your pass no etc. It gives you the chance to check-in and add extra services & luggage. What can a customer want other than these during buying a ticket online?
5	I found cheap, affordable flights quickly and easily. I should note that the 'cheapest' flights may not be for everyone. My 6-hour red-eye layover was manageable because I didn't mind sleeping on the airport seats. A 16-hour layover found me wanting to book a hostel just for one night, which resulted in unexpected costs (obviously unrelated to <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> and more to do with budget traveling). I enjoyed using the website and the customer service was very responsive. The only change I would ask for is enabling the customer to add additional baggage online after booking the flight, rather than having to contact customer support to do it for me. Customer support had it done in less than an hour, but I still wish I could have done it myself.
1	Why the Skypicker has a non-refundable policy.  I'll never use this page
5	I would like to thank Mr.David who helped me out on booking confirmation of tickets. There was a hold on ticket confirmation ,they solved it immediately .In future will book  flight tickets from kiwi. Thank you so much.
5	Dealing with the check-in issue and met Nina Kasap through the online Chat Portal. Very helpful, very responsive and my issue was solved within minutes! So glad to have such professional customer service. Keep up the good job, well done!
4	price for Lithuania was the cheapest to find on the internet with Skypicker
5	good experience with customer service agent regarding payment method
2	Start-up that finds discount flight tickets 'hidden' on airline websites launched.  <https://t.co/keWmGiKVHY> <https://t.co/8QxUWI87Xs>
5	I just had the greatest experience via live chat with Neil.  He was so incredibly, helpful, patient, and customer focused.  He got all 10 of my tickets sorted, seat assigned, and squared away.  Absolutely one of the best customer service experiences I have even had.  Thanks, Neil!
4	I actually had some problems because they forgot to check my flight in yesterday, but when I contacted them, Klara was very helpful and reassured me that everything will be sorted today. Hopefully everything will be ok now - fingers crossed!
5	<http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> is a great company. The customer service that it offers is exceptional. They ensure that all concerns and issues are properly dealt with.
5	I'd like to thank Aura for being a great customer service representative. Very patient and detailed. Provided me with loads of information and even links to solve my problem.
3	@belencerchi @skypickercom beware of delays mine cost 2400.
5	Thank you for your sincere working.When I made a booking airlines, I had an error of one passenger's name.I knew this situation after some days. So I sent you corectting the error with e-mail. I received the reply that we should correct it just now.But it took a long time , because of the relation with airline company.Every times, I sent you urgent e-mail. You always gave me the situation kindly. It finished today. Thank you for Mr. Jana and Mr.micha' s kindness especially .Regards
5	It seems that the live chat is not the fastest (or else there is a problem with my broadband) in the world but it's definitely 5 star. Valentin has solved my problem in no time. Big thanks and will definitely come back to you guys :)
5	Hello everyone!Skypicker is an easy to find flights when you need something quick and cheap. I looked on the internet to find something cheap because the flight that I finded in the first place was to expensive... For ex: the direct flight to my destination was 168 pounds and a flight with one stop (on Skypicker) was 61 pounds. I saved 107 pounds. Thank you Skypicker!And you people are very good! The one wich observed my mistake with passport expiry date and the lovely lady on live chat who helped me to make the correction.Have a lovely shift everyone and keep it that way all the time!PS: I know the rules! :)
5	I used Kiwi because they offered the best price and wasn't expecting much service. But I actually had an issue regarding extra weight which I bought with the initial booking. It was not reflected in the checkin of the airline.I contacted Kiwi via Live Chat and they solved the issue within a couple of hours. Contact was fast and friendly.
5	Peter was great. I had mis-typed my email address and he had it sorted within minute. The best! Professional and friendly. Thanks, Peter and Skypicker!
5	Simon H was very nice and professional explaining all i needed to know!Tanks to him and to Kiwi to have him working there :-)
5	There once was a man from AustraliaWho's email entry was a failureThe a techy named NatashaFixed it in a flash-aAnd now she's become my saviourIn all honesty, Natasha helped me a tonne and was so quick and kind. There is a chance her name was natalia but she was brilliant!
5	Great service at very competitive rates

5	Kira did a fantastic job! She was a pleasure to talk to; immediately understood my problems and quickly came back with great solutions. I can really recommend Kira and Skypicker!
1	The boarding pass is not available until the day before your flight. Usually when you buy your ticket, your seat number is on the ticket and everything is easily displayed. There is no such thing here. You buy a ticket and you have no seat number. It honestly feels as if your buying a standby ticket. Would honestly never recommend this to anybody!!! One time experience, never again!!!
5	Today I contact online chat help, the agent Sena was very patient and help me a lot to solve the problem, I can't image what will happen without her, this experience make me feel the <http://KIWI.COM|KIWI.COM> is a reliable company I can recommend it to my friends and their friends.
5	This is the first time i have used Skypicker and i must say the staff and the overall service have been excellent. Waqar, Daria and Elena- i must say fantastic level of customer service.
4	"I'm law school student who lives in Seoul, Korea.I bought a flight ticket for Karibo airport from Incheon Airport.And after the purchase, I realized that I didn't check on the extra baggage slot. So I was allowed to carry only 7 kilos hand luggage.I go Karibo for Scuba diving, so I need to carry some heavy things like my BCD, jet fins, etc...At first I wanted to cancel my ticket,but Skypicker's policy was non refundable.I tried to contact to skypicker via ""contact us"".I asked for cancellation first. and in the case if it's not possible I asked is there any possible alternative proposal.And, the respond was so fast.They mailed me back in 30 minute.(Even we are living in a global society, I didn't expected that fast response, because I live in Seoul. And Skypicker is in London.)And after some mails between me and skypicker's support team,we settled that I pay 53 euros more to get 20 kilos baggage limit for inbound and outbound.I appreciate skypicker's fast and continuous reply.It was really fast. I could handle it for very short time.(Thank you support manager Mariya Potello. Non refundable policy is the only reason why I gave 4 star. Your service was really fast, kind and great.)"
5	I give five stars to your employee named Kira. Unlike the others working at this company she actually understands English and understands what I mean. She has humor and is very service minded. Kira should go far within Kiwi or whatever company she decides to work at./Åsa
5	I'm surprised of how effective the guaranty policy is in case of getting stucked in any scale. It was a shame the next flight is in about 14hrs, but the refund fact for hotel and food it's also awesome! I got assistance from Hana, Nikola (twice) and Olga and were very effective, kind and helpful.
5	I was in contact with the Mr. Alan Whitfield whom was completely helpful and polite. Until this moment, I am very happy with the services provided by <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>.
5	Using Skypicker was very easy and helpful.  I will definetly use it again for future travels. I highly recommend!
5	@stephensilber @skypickercom Only 3?! Personally I like to go through customs enough to greet each agent working :)
5	Very pleased with your services and the speed with which you replied to my messages in particular!
5	I recommend this company,for how quickly responded to my issue.ThanksTomas Krivanek for your help.
5	Love it! Awesome search options and super helpful customer service :)
5	Great booking service. It`s realy cheapest, comparing with Skyskanner, OneTwoTrip and other. Also I realy like it`s usability, easy to found flight exactly that I looking for.Also nice support in 10 munites I`ve solved my booking issue. Spechial thanks for Huan Kosta from support for his gently and useful support.
4	I had a little delay in my trip and contacted by phone the assistance where I talked to Daniele. I let him know there was the chance I could not make it to the connecting flight and he reassured he would keep track of the situation. Luckily I made it to the connecting flight and the operator checked on me contacting me by phone during the lay over. Very helpful staff, easy to reach (only a couple minute wait on the phone) and reassuring.I'll be flying again with them shortly with a connecting flight operated by ryanair.
5	User interface for picking your flight is awesome. Although on my smartphone it seemed to be not responsive enough. This however does not affect functionality. Maybe because of the price of flight itself, the fees were low as well. After the choice of flight everything went smoothly. I did not expect that electronic ticket would come in my own language, I used English on website, it came with some useful warnings in my language somehow detected, possibly based on payment by card. Boarding passes came one week before flight to email. Passport number has been solicited per email  with a sort of reminder. Enough info. Perfect. I don't have experience with customer service line, because in my case there was no need.

5	grazie Daniele per l'aiuto.....sei stato efficiente, professionale e molto gentile.
5	Puput saved my evening! We couldn't find our tickets nor any information from Kiwi about our flights. Puput was super helpful and patient, finding our reservation and helping us through the checkin process. Super service! Thank you once again for your help!
5	Really great service! Had a live chat with Phana and was extremely friendly and helpful. Would definitely use Skypicker again in the future :)
5	Thank you very much for very nice service from your side. I have spoken to Ira. V. through livechat and have got some help to my booking conformation. She is serviceminded and helpful, very sweet agent!!! Furthemore, I have got a service in my native language which was a great surprise!!!
1	"In good faith we purchased flights from Sydney to Los Angeles with a connection in Auckland.  Only after our purchase did we learn that we could not check-in online and would have to claim and re-check our baggage in Auckland - added risk and a hassle but seemed doable.  The kicker was that ONLY AFTER claiming our baggage in Auckland did we learn that we had to go through New Zealand Immigration/Customs, even though only simply transiting the airport facility.  The line was very long and very slow, taking 57 minutes to complete.  Thus, the connection time that seemed OK was really condemned to failure from the start.  The result was that check-in was ""closed"" for our subsequent flight when we arrived to check-in.  <http://KIWI.COM|KIWI.COM> stuck us with the nearly $900 USD cost for booking subsequent flights at an upcharge rate."

4	Fist Hana and then Filip both were great and I feel they really try to help me and undesrtand my issue, Of couse the time I had to wait was a lot, but is great they notice you before.I hope the answer I waiting for both will be as great as the attention
5	My flight is in 2 days and I have been worrying about my baggage limit. Spoke to a gentleman named Nikola, and he researched the individual airlines I'll be travelling with and provided me with information on their baggage limits. He was also a very friendly individual who gave me some insight as to what I should expect on my journey, as he had past experience.Their customer service made me smile. Definitely recommended!
1	On recent travel to Myanmar (Burma), I used Skypicker to book an internal flight with Air KBZ. Skypicker however does not make it clear that the airline allows you to check in 1 baggage of up to 20kg for free, instead you are left with the impression that you have to pay for it at £20.12(approx. USD 28), which I did. On contacting Skypicker and asking for a refund of the baggage cost as it was actually free I got the reply from their staff Francesco Marra:'Unfortunately we can't refund you for the luggage that you add because you provided to add it by yourself without consulting us'.The fact is Francesco, if your company misrepresents on your website checked baggage has to be paid for, then I as a consumer will comply if I wish to check in a baggage. In addition, the point of the internet is that I should not have to 'consult' you.Essentially you are defrauding your customers by this deception. This is pure profit for Skypicker.For anyone interested, currently there is a free 20kg checked baggage allowance for internal flights in Myanmar using internal airlines (may differ for non Myanmar airlines)
5	I had a very nice chat with Patrik Pivoda who helpt me with all of my questions (even some stupid ones)  he was quick at responding and had very clear answers.
5	The flight from Thai Smile Airways Siem reap - Bangkok is cancelled... Not on information before for me...
5	"The problem was a booking of 2 tickets at CambodiaAngkorAir directly on their website. Unfortunately, I got no confirmation, no reply to my e-mail and on the internet there were only two more tickets available for this flight - just from <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>. So I booked them and got the etickets and confirmation right away.In order to prevent a double booking and to be absolutely sure that a booking was made at CamboiaAA (for example, at “virtuallythere” all my other flights were confirmed, but this still not) I called Kiwi support Germany.It was a very friendly lady (Marie F.) on the phone, which I could describe the problem. She then communicated by email and phone with CambodiaAA and I got a series of mails about the status and finally the problem was solved.I think you can well understand how important it is for a ""Dschungle flight"" which is also a connection flight, not only to get clarity about the ticket, but also to have a competent contact if you have such a problem.All the more I would like to thank the exemplary service and support of <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>.Das Problem war eine Buchung von 2 Tickets bei CambodiaAngkorAir direkt auf deren website. Leider bekam ich keine Bestätigung, keine Antwort auf meine E-Mail und im Internet gab es nur zwei weitere Karten für diesen Flug - eben von <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>. Also buchte ich sie und bekam die etickets und die Bestätigung sofort. Um nun eine Doppelbuchung zu verhindern und überhaupt sicher zu sein, dass eine Buchung bei CamboiaAA zustande kam (z.B. bei “virtuallythere” waren alle meine anderen Flüge bestätigt, nur dieser nicht) habe ich Kiwi  support Germany angerufen. Es war ein sehr freundlche Dame (Marie F.) am Telefon, der ich das Problem schildern konnte. Sie hat daraufhin per email und Telefon mit CambodiaAA kommuniziert und ich bekam eine Reihe von mails über den jeweiligen Stand und schließlich wurde das Problem gelöst.Ich glaube man kann gut verstehen, wie wichtig es ist, bei einem ""Dschungel-Flug"", der auch noch einen Anschluss-flug darstellt, nicht nur Klarheit über das Ticket zu bekommen, sondern auch einen kompetenten Ansprechpartner in einem Problemfall zu haben.Um so mehr danke ich dem vorbildlichen Service und Support von <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>."
5	The company found alternative way for my travel when all flights were already sold on the specific date, moreover it was so much cheaper than expected! I received the prepared board cards via email, which was great- there was no need to make the checking by myself. Thank you very much <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com>! You have my highest recommendations! Definitely will use you again!
5	Thanks for help Sena.
5	Very fast, friendly and helpful assistance. Thank you Aura!
5	Check-in turned out to be a bit complicatecd, thus had to contact the support chat. Anna Alaxinova provided excellent help and did the check-in for me. Excellent client support, even on Sunday.
5	has not reseived comfirmation email.however <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> staff helped me toresent it to me.Thank you so much.
5	The people in Skyplcker are extremely helpful  and friendly  !After my flight is was cancelled, they rebuke me straight away ,even they pay more then half for the new much better flight !I would recommend this company everyone!  Thank you again !Your team are fantastic :relaxed:
5	Great Service, i faced an issue but Agent.Babak helped me and got it solved . I love this website.
5	great service at best price i could find
4	I used their live chat in order to speak to someone about a query I had about a flight I booked. I wasn't kept waiting for very long and the customer service representative that I spoke to, Lenka, was not only extremely helpful by clearing up the query I had but very empathetic too. I felt like I was talking to a real person who really cared about the customer. I am very impressed with <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> and the staff they employ to deal with customers. Who said low cost flight companies meant sub-par customer service? The only reason why I haven't given 5 stars is because I haven't gone on my flight yet because it isn't for at least 2 months but so far so very good!
5	they were very quick
5	Very efficient and reliable service. Many thanks to SKYPICKER.
5	Everything was fine, got slightly better price + checked baggage allowance (in comparison when booking directly with the airline).There was little bit complication with the check-in online, which originally seemed to be not possible for this reservation (and was quite urgent for me to have, because I had only limited time on the airport). But after contacting Skypicker online support, everything was resolved, online check-in was made by them and I have received my boarding pass to e-mail as I needed.Can recommend!
5	premetto che e' la prima volta che prenoto tramite Kiwi e nonostante le mie preoccupazioni iniziali per quanto riguarda i siti on-line devo ammettere che sono rimasto veramente colpito dalla professionalita' e la celerita' nel risolvere i problemi e le pratiche dimostrata da Valeria & Daniele due bravissimi ragazzi molto preparati che mi hanno seguito ....secondo me meritano un aumento!!!!  :-)
1	Silly searching, high price. There are much better....
4	Today was a long day, after all the trouble i would like to thank Anastasia of Kiwi for her help on finally getting our trip in order, regards!!
5	I wrote them because I had a doubt with the bagagges.I was speaking with Babak. He was polite and effective.He helped me with my booking number and other issues until he found my flight.The bagagges' doubt was solved.I am pleased with the chat service.
5	I chose skyscanner website because I wanted a cheap flight. So when I made a mistake on the flight details turning my boyfriend into a female I was so angry at myself for throwing away money. To my utter surprise and delight Kristina Blahova who answered my call was really lovely, reassuring and kind. Not only was my phone call answered after 30 seconds on hold, but my problems was fixed within 30 minutes. Many thanks!
1	"Kiwi will state that their partner China Southern Airlines will not issue refunds or credits toward ticket changes.  They will try to sell you another ticket at full price. They will recommend canceling the first trip with no credit toward the change. Upon contacting CSA, who did provide me with credit for canceling my initial flight, I was made aware of Kiwi's untruthful and misleading change policy. Buyer beware. They will also charge you for baggage. Not CSA policy. Scam.And from CSA correspondence:""6.     Schedule change optionsIf the tickets were purchased at online agent, please contact your original online travel agency to make any changes or process refund."""
5	Our flights are ridiculously cheap.I forgot to put my passport info, and it's good that they have live chat since I am not good at using phone as a foreigner.Mr. Ulug'bek Z, the staff, was so nice, he dealt with that very quickly, like 2-3 mins.I would definitely use Skypicker again!

1	Dealing with this company was horrible. Little to no customer concern or care and no effort made to resolve what was an incredibly simple issue.
1	Dealing with this company was a really horrible experience. I usually don't write reviews because I usually don't care, but the process of trying to resolve a fairly straightforward issue with this company through their ridiculous business model, and complete lack of customer care or support was motivation enough for me to make an exception.For the sake of your travel and general sanity, avoid Skypicker at all costs.
5	GREAT TEAM... ALL PERFECT...
5	Great customer service - Thanks Filip! very helpful and pro-active!
4	Excellent and quick service by the staff (Lydie Buckova) to add additional luggage on the reservation.Thank you for your help.
5	Klara and Krstyna were very friendly, helpful, patient, and efficient  with my request for additional help regarding my booking Paris-Venice.  I will not hesitate to request help again if needed and will recommend KIWI to my friends.Marilee
5	Will have my flights in few days, but already had an opportunity to use help of the online consultant; Yulia was very nice and informative, and it's always a pleasure to have such a quick reply! Thank you for an understanding service :)
5	Thanks to Juan Costa for a great help with our boarding passes
5	I had to change my flight dates and got immediate help and answer by Michal Stasek. Thanks again!I can highly recommend this company, it makes travelling easier :).Best regards,Sina
4	the most steeler and sheater company ever >:o
5	Very kind assistence and great atention.
5	We used Skypicker to book a flight from Cassablanca to Berlin with a connecting flight through Brussels, but when the connecting flight (Brussels to Berlin) was cancelled due to the Brussels airport closure, we were stressed about how we were going to reroute to Berlin. Luckily, we had a fantastic customer service representative, James, helping us out.James was legitimately the most helpful customer service rep I've dealt with in a long time. He found us an alternative route to Berlin after working tirelessly with the re-booking departments that met all of our criteria, and got us into Berlin 6 hours earlier than we had originally planned to get there, which was great. He even provided great directions on how to get to our final destinations in Berlin via train. He was unreal!
5	I made an error in my booking (by booking a return flight on the wrong date).  I called kiwi and the customer services representative Francesco was incredibly helpful in helping me to rebook another flight and even went as far as to try and get me a refund for my mistake.  Excellent firm, would definitely use again
5	Hey !i'm going to a vacation in budapest next month!and i forgot to add the right baggage...I want to thank kira for saving me and help me to chang it so easily !thank yo for your service!
5	This was my first time using <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>. Was not entirely sure how the check in works, but Vika from customer service has been very helpful and has explained everything in detail.Would highly recommend!
5	Thanks for the quick and friendly help.
5	Great customer service! Good prices! Perfect work from the on-line chat, especially Barbora
5	As a first-time Skypicker user, have nothing but compliments for their service via support@skypicker.   They got back to me within the hour and were able to help resolve a baggage problem quickly.  Thanks to Mariya and her team!
5	The skyskiper Team delivers their service with a huge willing to help and get the client help with their performance. Thank you to all the support team and a special attention to Juraj and Sofia. !
5	Very pleased with the customer service! On both occasions that I have been attended -- the first time by Ahn and the second time by Jakub -- I got all the information I needed in a rather short notice and in a very professional and kind manner. Thanks so much!Best,Ivan
4	The email support that I used to make some changes in my personal details, has been really fast. Also, the phone call I made to make the changes was prompt in responding. Overall, a great customer service.
1	Really bad experience with KIWI, really bad costumer service, I have been booked with them a flight from Kiev to Vilna for 65 euros, i get the invoice in my email, but the day after i recieved an email saying the price was rise to 227.50. and also i already have my accommodation for VilnaI think they must cover the differences, is not my problem if the airline rose the prices, i will not recomend this to anybody
5	I made a mistake with my email and asked them for help. They were very diligent and their help was fast and efficient.Thanks!!
5	Great service by Simon. Really helped me out and was incredibly nice!
1	Thats the worse website ever !!!never gonna book anything thru them, I'm trying to change my original destination, contacted with them 3 weeks ago never got my email with proposition and prices so not only spend 300€  for flights I'm not gonna use and also spend half of my afternoon yesterday talking with useless customer services telling me that they don't know why i didn't get any email!!and that they have to check THE FLIGHTS AGAIN and send it to me all over new prices!!!i ask to spoke to Manager was on hold for 30 min,ask them to called me back leave my phone number with the girl on the customer service chat ,NEVER GET BACK TO ME!!never gonna book anything with them !gonna be easier and faster to find and booked the tickets myself!....USELESS
5	Good to know there is a living person in cyperspace who can help you with any question you might have concerning your travel.The response came right away :-)
5	I am trying to get an airport tax refund for a missed flight and to cancel a future flight, so far the customer care has worked great and I find the online chat a super useful and simple tool how to get any questions answered. Thanks to Irina!
4	Today, I chat with Tomas U who helped me out with an issue with my ticket. I was so ready to cancel my flight and ticket but after I spoke with this agent, he did an excellent job and I ended up keeping my ticket.
4	Fast and very helpful support received via online Chat from Mohamend! Thank you very much
5	I spoke with Valentin over chat on 7th September regarding a change in flight, and he made the whole process very easy, and very quick! He was a pleasure to speak to, and did not rush me at all. He assured me of the change, and after payment, said that I would get confirmation email soon. He is really a good asset to your team Kiwi! Thanks,Trupti
5	He solved my issue taking time and kindly
5	Thanx Martin Carter for being so diligent with the surname change in my tickets :)
4	I had an error with some information on my booking and Jakub, a service agent, was very helpful with getting the right information applied to my booking.I'm very satisfied with my experience.
5	absolutely amazing efficiency. communication is is A* even on a Sunday.What a pleasure to deal with such a helpful team.
5	Nice website to find a trip which isn't expansive. Serious offer. I recommend.
5	easy to book a multi destination trip
5	I had a lot of questions about my flight confirmation and baggage, and Tomas U was incredibly patient, nice and helpful. I appreciate it.
4	I would like to thank Dmitriy Kondik, who helped me get information around how my luggage was actually checked. The service was very prompt, polite and nice. I feel less stressed and more secure traveling after this experiene, because I know I can get help very quickly if needed.
5	Best customer service I have ever gotten from any travel agency. I chatted with Lucy O'Brien who was very helpful and polite even though the error I needed to fix was my own
4	I have bought tickets to the route:Kiev (Ukraine) - Fiumicino (Rome, Italy) - Sofia (Bulgaria)Sofia (Bulgaria) - Dortmund (Germany) - Kiev (Ukraine)Route to Sofia was ok - fast and with no issues except for the one. Ukrainian airlines doesn't have a contract with WizzAir so they failed to check-in my luggage to the Sofia directly. I wasn't able to re-check-in the luggage too because I didn't have the Shengen visa, only the Bulgarian one. So I took the bag (fortunately not too big) with me to the cabin.Route back from Sofia to Kiev was bad.The main problem was the connection 12 hours in the province airport with no ability to walk around. This was caused my failure to proceed through the transit area of Dortmund airport because this airport simply !doesn't have such area! What a mess!!! Majority of small province airports of Germany don't have transit areas too. So be careful traveling through them with only destination country visa open. You may be asked to go home because this is the violation of border passing rules.
5	Es la mejor forma de reservar en un solo paso varios vuelos conectados entre si, en los que se ajustan los horarios, escalas y otras conexiones.
5	The passenger I booked this for had some problems on the way, but they were not <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>'s fault ( I didn't investigate visa restrictions properly ) and she got safely home in the end, on time.  Just a warning, if you have to change planes in Saudi-Arabia - talk to the airline for requirements before booking.I am very impressed that when I called the service line, they answered quickly and spoke very clear English and spoke in calm helpful manner.  Even something was wrong with my phone and the automated system didn't understand when I punched in the booking number (using a 14yr old landline handset), I was still connected to a service agent quickly.Last time I booked with a budget agency, in January 2011, I was supposed to get a refund because of a changed schedule - but I never got the refund and they neither answered phones or email (they are still operating: <http://Travellink.dk|Travellink.dk>).  Fortunately the credit card company reversed the transaction.So I had already seen a lot of good reviews about <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> before booking and I hope other wont be afraid to try them cos I certainly will.Thor
4	then it was  very nice to be able to connect at any time with operators..being desperate in a foreign country does not help very much.I am sure Skypicker could solve  our problem had it been necessary !!!
2	last minute change of flights, without any transfers. I had to do a transit VISA for KL (Personally). They have just booked the flights point to point. Never book a flight in SKYPICKER!
5	Thanks Eugene!! Before I asking you about the regulation of the baggage, I worried about it so much cause I didn't know about the rules. But Thanks to your kind reply I knew that I can bring nail clippers into my bag. Thanks so much :D
5	Had some problems when I entered the wrong details into my booking,BUT the superhero they call Magda (Customer Support) fixed it in a jiffy!It was all very fast and smooth. There was no need to worry!All praise Magda, she's divine.Thanks for the help,Jesper
4	My experience was mostly great and saved about $500 from the other major flight sites. I also had a nice layover in London which was fun. The downside to this is sometimes you have very long layovers and if you at not planning on going into town it makes it annoying. But if you have luggage it makes sense to have enough time to go get it and get back through security. This is a great site and everything went smoothly. It is best to only use a carry on but make sure the carry on is small enough for all of the other airlines! otherwise you will pay 40 dollars for each connecting flight and it adds up!
4	Before I could explain the reason for going onto the live chat, Elsa C. was quick to run through my bookings and identify the question that I was going to ask. I was really impressed with her initiative and the service that she's provided.
4	Even though it can be complicated, with for example the support-email adress not working for me, The customer service people are very helpful, thank you Amil for helping me out
3	RT @Haidaloup: This New App Will Find You the Cheapest International Flight <https://t.co/3rodkFn7Ss> via @CNTraveler #ttot #traveltips
4	We re-scheduled a flight to Manchester from Copenhagen. During this process Anas Dallal from Skypicker has been a great help, assiting with quick and professional help.Thanks for great help.Rune
5	I had an AWFUL and HORRIBLE experience with Iberia, I lose my flight because a mistake made by 2 of their employees. Tamara @ <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> helped me a lot to solve this.
1	They are thiefs, the worst  company  i ever  had anything  to do  with,i purchased my ticket and i couldn't  fly because of them ,STAY AWAY FROM THOSE THIEFS, STAY AWAY FROM THEM,
5	Miro was great and helped me out. I recommend this service.
5	Mayyar helped me (not sure how to spell it, but he was a great help:))
5	Got quick and friendly help.
4	Not all flights were automatically checked-in.
5	I was only on hold for approximately five minutes and the agent (Martin Carter) was professional, efficient and... well, human. Really nice guy!
4	It was nice to have all the separate flights in one place but after I bought time I have seen a small difference in price.. it would have been cheaper to buy them separately but more time consuming. All in all good service
5	I fully recommend doing business with Kiwi. Airlines cancelled my flight so I called Kiwi support - Zdenka Bornova did such an amazing job helping me out & finding alternatives that I have to write a review. Best customer support I had in my life.
5	Since i had no experience with flying Ryan air and i was not sure about procedures so i asked at the live-chat which served me - clear, kind, pro-active. It was very satisfying problem solving. thank you.
5	One of the best services I ever received. Katerina (from Czech Republic) was awesome. Sh was so patient and polite.This girl deserves a payrise for her excellent job. Thank you Katerina.
5	"Fast, helpful, intelligent! Special thanks an Daniel! Will keep ""Kiwi"" in my mind for the next travel!  Thank you all!"
4	Writing in to congratulate the job your Agent Viktor P. does.  He was friendly, accommodating and very efficient.  I was very impressed.  Job well done!
5	My flight was cancelled and I received an email about that. The suggestion for the change was a bit tight and I asked Kiwi for help. It was dear Dominika who helped me out and was so nice about the alternative. I had done research on what would be a nice flight. Dominika would have approved my idea if her suggestion wouldnt have been a better one, because I picked her recommendation, after she told me my idea was fine. So she found me a better flight than I was willing to take. Now I have a flight with a day to spare in Stockholm. Top!
5	I had some questions about my E-tickets and I got the help and attention I needed immediately; Martin Pospisil answered all of my questions and was very patient. I'm pretty satisfied and haven't had any problems with my booked flight until now.
5	I've used Skypicker before and I always appreciate your service very much. They are always very fast in repliing, and thanks to you Henry Gharagyozyan this time.
5	I've booked a ticket in skypicker and I made a mistake in entering my personal details.  Mrs. Lydie B. was a great and kind help. She was patient about my questions and kind to call the airline company and sorted things out. Thank you again!
5	I connected to your online chat service several time , but the the service at the last conract was graet, My issue has been solved by her effort and attention , I want to extend my gratefullness for her assitance which made me to feel better about your service. The rate i will gave is just about her caring
4	Fast, easy booking. E-tickets right to your phone and all check-in with out problems even if I had more than one stop on my trip.
4	Had a great customer service experience via live chat and receive clear information, which I didn't find myself.Thank you,Kristina Buresova!
1	As you see I booked a ticket with <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> from Sharm-El Sheikh to Amsterdam at  22-11-2016. Then I'got an e-mail that the plane was overbooked, so I would get a refund. Later in the week I still saw the same ticket on your website. So my boyfriend decided to call and ask if the ticket was still available. The helpdesk told him that if it was on the website, we could book the fligth. So he did at  28-11-2016.  Eventually he got an e-mail again, that there were techniqual problems, so we could get a refund of our money, again....We called again and told the whole story. Another person from the helpdesk said that he would look for us what he could do.No response from him. So my boybfriend called the next day again. Your employee told us that all the flights were completely full when flying with Air Cairo, so there was no possibility we could book this flight. And that this kind of things happen quite often. They said that they would get the flight of the internet as soon as possible. Every day I looked on your website and everyday the same flight is still available after 15 days!!!? But now for a price of 712 euro, instead of the 223 euro I bought it the first time for. Quite strange if you ask me. So is this the normal way to communicate with your customers??I feel betrayed and I hope together we can come  to a resonable solution.  Because at the moment we only have a flight from Amsterdam to  Sharm-el Sheikh. If we want fly back, every ticket is double the price or an extremely long traveling period. My idea is that <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> at least offer us a comparable flight back, for the same or a reasonable price. Because this is not the way you should treath your customers.
5	I talked to Adam J on the live chat and he was super helpful and very kind! Couldn't have asked for anything else!
5	Anna helped me with my question very well ,  and was was attentive
5	I booked my flight with skypicker many times and it always met my expectations. What I like the most is that I dont have to do a check in by myself, just put down my details. Very nice experience I had last time, when I made mystake with my personal details. When I  was chcecking it on website noticed it was wrong and contacted customer servise late at night via e-mail. And in morning I had already reply from Adam that everything is fixed. Big plus for efficiency ... keep it up :D
5	Great company to book with. When I had a query the fantastic Mario R resolved it straight away for me on web chat. Highly recommend Mario and <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com>
4	4 stars because i was missing a boarding pass but luckly help assistant Yulia.Y solved the problem in seconds. Thank you again Yulia.
5	It was a problem (I bought a ticket at <http://aviasles.ru|aviasles.ru>) and I didnt know is everything is ok or not. Because the usual time for getting answer from <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> is 4 hours. I called to Mario and he helped me to make this information faster! due to it I could be in time to the airport. Thank you a lot!
1	Airline had cancelled flights but they didn't inform me and it was so shit when you at the airport and asked them for help and the answer just would be contract in one hour One hour past but nothing happened Won't use them again
5	I want to thank RomanIt helped me to complete information and thingswithout him I could not handle
5	Sena at <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> was absolutly wonderful! The whole issue was resolved quickly and efficiently and she was very nice even though it  was 100% MY mistake she was fixing! Thanks again Sena!
5	Thanks very much to help us on help desk. Especially to Olga M. We will using Skypicker again in future.
5	Fly over there with <https://t.co/JeOQ372EEU>. You can book hotel and rent car too. <https://t.co/tpGBaK6mNg>
1	"Very Poor experience! Made errors to booking had to pay more at the airport. When we were checking in they couldnt find out our booking and said we hadnt paid. To gain a refund has taken 4 months. each time making contact they ""havnt"" received emails. Im beginning to think its a scam."

1	Today, I visited the airport to board my international flight from Japan to the Philippines. I also booked my musical instrument as an extra seat on the flight (as I have done with other airlines in the past). When I arrived at the airport, the ticket agent said I needed to call Kiwi to combine the two reservations. I called Kiwi and they said they would call the airline to change the reservation. After waiting an hour, the airline agent came over to check on the progress. I called Kiwi again and they said they were still on hold with the airline. They finally got through to the airline and changed the booking, but the airline said it was now too late to board the flight. The Kiwi agent said they would call the airline to change the flight and would charge me a change fee. Later in the evening, I called Kiwi and they said I had missed my flight, and thus there was nothing they could do.$900... It might not be a lot of money to you, Kiwi... But it's a hell of a lot to a traveling street musician who lives on tips. If someone at the company of any influence reads this: please take the profits you earned from my flight and donate it to charity.
5	Skypicker has great customer service, available on sunday evening, and guy named Jonathan was so kind and helped me to do the online check-in even after deadline 72 hours before departure.
4	They offered great support and my consultant especially, Radek Pospisil, was very nice and useful.
5	Thanks to Daniele Livrieri who sorted out missing  boarding pass in less than 24 h before my flight. You are great guys. Quick answer, very professional.

1	So I this will be long winded , I booked a flight on the 25th of August for a flight on the 22nd of November , now my mom has a brain tumour and had gone blind in one eye and is having an operation on the 21st of November and wanted me to take care of my brother that is autistic for her , so I booked it Heathrow to Oslo and to Los Angeles. Now I never received an email to confirm but then I decided to book another flight from Las Vegas to Dallas and I got the conformation right away and I thought oh that was weird , I'll call and ask if the other went ok , when I called I was told the email was wrong so it was corrected , when I received my email confirmation for my flight to Los angles to my horror it said the 6th of December ! I thought this isn't right so I called right away and explained that the flight was completely wrong it's not even wrong by a couple of days it's not even the right month ! I said if I had realised this when I got the email I would have called. Now first of all I know I wouldn't book a different because of the significance of the date to me in November. So I called was told there is nothing they can do. They said I made a mistake. I booked this on their app I said this isn't possible. I didn't even tell them about the story in the background but my anger right now of how insensitive they are is just fuelling , I will guarantee you I will fight this to the end. I have already printed out your T&Cs. I work for an insurance company as a Quality insurance auditor and I will not rest until you have implemented TCF. Treating customers fairly. Funny how when I asked what your turnaround time was for complaints was you gave me the wrong email address the first time then a complains one after I asked about it. No doubt I will take this to Twitter and every social media.   Sad because I thought you were a good company hence why I booked another flight with you. I would pay the extra amount if I had the funds and not for my mothers condition
5	simple but easy to use
5	When I experienced a small problem with my ticket, Jana Zdechovanova from Kiwi, went well above and beyond to fix my problem and create a pleasant trip. My issue was resolved very quickly, efficient and with very high professionalism. Great company. Good prices. Thanx!
4	Return flight I payd twice, because Debet card used of Kiwi office isn't the same as in my e-ticket.I am waiting for refund.
5	They were always aviable in live chat and a worker there named Olga really got me out of troubles haha
4	Great online support , faced few issues initially but all issues were sorted immediately and definitely the tickets are way cheaper than any other travel site ! Highly recommend to those travellers who are sure about their destinations well in advance .
5	Great service!
5	Now, it is true I don't fly a lot because I mostly hate the customer service of some agencies and it will always be a part of traveling (as we can no longer walk up, buy a ticket and explore the skies :( too bad, really)... But this dream of an agent (Neil) was most definitely a turning point. Professional, calm, helpfull... This guy... This guy should get a bonus. Great service, great prices... I made the right pick! (Yes pun very much intended)Thank you for a great experience!
5	Martin Carter was amazingly helpful when I needed to change my flight. My flight between the US and Europe was a 60% discount compared to any other site on the internet. AWESOME!
4	Thank you so much for all your team Thank u Adrian
5	I am really satisfied with the online chat. It is more convenient than waiting in the phone. All the stuff is very helpful (especially Julia), and gave me quick answers to all the issues I encountered.
5	Dear Lusine and Daria:It's a big thank you for all all your help. They are friendly and help me a lot.Have a good day.Best regards, Mango(Chang, Chia-Wen) from Taiwan Customer Relations
5	Best Service! Thank you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5	Chatted with Zuzana about the check in system and seats. She was very helpful and solved all my questions without hesitation.Great service, congratulations Zuzana
5	I'm really positively surprised by the seriousness of this company! First I had my doubts, even because we had problems with the baggage size. But the contact (with Romain Rouchet) and his help and effort disabused me!Like other new and small companies, there are problems, but they demonstrate commitment and try to please the customers!
5	Thank you Eleonora and Anita for helping me  correct the name for one off the passanger. Verry professional you quickly. Thanks and have a great weekend :)
5	super support when I could not find my ticket.
5	Donald did a great job assisting me. Thank you ! fksjglfjsdklgjfkld
5	My flight was regrettably cancelled, but your customer service did all in its power to find me an alternative itinerary, and if that wasn't possible, a full refund, which in itself is really, really great. I contacted this service live chat three times and each time I was met with understanding, professionalism and the utmost courtesy. Especially Alaa and Artem Krohin were very helpful, prompt and patient with me, I really felt in good hands. WIth Artem we quickly came to a compromise and essentially a solution that I cannot complain about!Also, your flight search engine is seriously amazing... <3Thank you!

1	"I just bought two tickets from Budapest,Hungry to Madrid Spain. Unfortunately, I made a mistake I did not notice, that Wizz Air would take me to Brussels only, where I would connect to the Madrid flight via Ryan Air after 10 hours overlay. I went back to Skipicker's website where there is an option for ""changing your booking"". But it is a trap! I would have to pay the full price of a new ticket not allowing me pay difference for a new reservation. Other words there is no changing, only new ticket buying options.I have sent an email, explaining my situation, The answer is ""The extra cost(s) for the changes will be 203(€), and is non-refundable"" Lesson learnt: Skypicker is selling tickets at least 7$ more expensive then airlines direct. If I buy tickets from airlines, I would have option to change my ticket within 24 hours without any charge. This company apparently  buying up cheap tickets ahead, and selling it to passengers on a regular airline direct price, with no flexibility or options. This is nothing but abusing customer's right, and supplying low quality product. There is no reason to use this underground companies anymore, they follow everyday airline ticket prices+ add some commissions to it."
4	"Without Prejudice: Observed inability to get proper feedback or clarifications on transit conditions at Denpasar airport on the phone call to Australian number. Experienced constant troubles with ""free"" but hopeless WiFi for several hours at Denpasar. Eventually found a restaurant with reasonable consistency of WiFI to continue my work whilst in transit. Screen shot is available to prove my point.Booking process and prices with straight payment by Master Card seem to be better than OK. Skypicker process is not comparable with my experience of deliberate cheating by Jetstar through ""voucher"" system."
5	It was very helpful to contact <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> via chat. Aliaksandra provided to me information about flight booking in my country and resolved ambiguity. Operative and clear.
4	Used skypicker recently for flights to france. Unfortunately, due to air traffic control strikes our flight was cancelled. Massive effort from James saw us getting to france on alternative flights to make a wedding we were attending. He worked tirelessly to provide us with an affordable solution and we are very grateful.  Thanks James!
5	On the 24th of September, my flight from Copenhagen to Bangkok had a 3h delay, which made me miss my connection flight to Chiang Mai.At the airport in Copenhagen I sent a message on fb to <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> asking for assistance. Very quickly I got an answer and I was told that by the time I I landed in Bangkok I would have 3 options of flights to go to Chiang Mai. So it happened. The only problem was, none of the options really suited me, for I had to reach Chiang Mai before 5pm, to be able to take the last bus from there to Pai, which departed at 5:30pm. At the airport in Bangkok I was offered by Thai Smile (the airline with whom I was originally flying to Chiang Mai) to go to the ticketing office of Thai Airways, cause they would offer me a new flight. The options they gave me both arrived in Chaing Mai before 4:30pm, but they also costed around 35 euros. I then wrote <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> again, through the live chat on Kiwi's website and very efficiently Saskia told me I could buy one of those flights and <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> would refund me.I want to thank <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> and it's employees for the amazing support and service.Best Regards,Gabriel Austregesilo.
1	Thought I give Skypicker a try, but unfortuntaely had a terrible experience. They've provided us with the wrong information about our flight (ryanair). They emailed us, we have to check in at the airport (but we knew airport check-in isn't available for ryanair). Tried to check in online, didn't work, no one answered our emails. Went to airport early to sort it out with ryanair directly, but they said they had this issue with skypicker before and there's nothing they can do for us... and we had to deal with extra fees (90€) and stress. Tried to contact Skypicker customer service afterwards, but still haven't received an answer. ryanair and skypicker is a combination that definitely does not work!
5	I needed info on the airlines I was flying. I got on chat and a woman named Barbara came on to help. I have to say she was great. She helped me with all my questions and was a very friendly about it as well. I hope that if I need to contact you guys again I get the same person. Thank you Barbara you made it so much easier for me. God bless you!
5	Adding extra luggage by chatting with Bodgan using the online chat was painless, thanks!
5	I forgot to check-in before it was too late. Fortunately I got in touch with the chat-employee Miroslav and Tamara who made the check-in and even added extra check-in-luggage eventhough the internal rules said No. This is great service!! It would cost me 140 euro to do the check-in (not incl. luggage) in the airport, so the customer-service department and especially Miroslav and Tamara  really made my day!Five stars from me!!!
5	It was great the help from Alan! Nice and efficient, giving all the time helpfull ideas. He solved my baggage problem quickly and efficiently.
5	I gave wrong passport number when making a reservation. Tried to solve it myself, but was unable to. Got hold on Miroslav in help chat and he was able to help me and made it really easy for me. Service could not have been better. Thank you.
4	We went through Skypicker flying return to India. The day of our trip home we realised that the date of our confirmation was one day different to the date of our automatically generated (through Skypicker) boarding pass. This meant a (unbeknown to us) 24 hour stop over in KL and arriving home a day later than we expected. It was only through checking our documents carefully that we noted this change and were not informed or alerted to this in any manner by Skypicker. Saying this, I had my brother call Skypicker as soon as I noticed this to see what the deal was. The airline had changed their flight and so technically it was out of Skypickers hands. Through all conversations with Skypicker about the situation they were extremely helpful and responded in a very timely manner (thanks Neil!!). Everything was clarified really quickly which gave us a bit of time for planning. They also refunded us 50€ each for accommodation for the night in KL, which we were thankful for. A good experience with Skypicker all up! :)
4	Thank you very much Alan!!!  Your atention was awesom, kind regards!  :)
5	I missed the adventure generator from #Drungli, but #Skypicker looks like a good alternative. - Looking for flights in #Brazil.
1	On July 12 I booked a flight with Kiwi as a cost effective route from London to Dallas Texas for September 9. I was able to confirm a flight for three flights and while i wasn't too excited to have a nearly 24 hour lay over in Boston, I accepted it for cost. On September 3 I received an email stating that my flight was cancelled. The next offer cut my travel a day short, I chose not to accept this offer because I had prepaid accommodations and tours. The next offer was to cut my trip short three days, also not acceptable. After sending several emails on my behalf questioning whether I had a flight, I finally was able to connect with someone. Then subsequently was still receiving emails stating that my original flights were scheduled as normal. Upon finalizing an actual flight out of London, I had additional baggage I was trying to get situated. The call center said they would work on it, they didn't. I had to call several times more to situate the additional luggage. I will never recommend this site to anyone. This was my first experience and I was very unhappy to have spent the last week of my vacation worrying about if I had a flight home and if my luggage would be a problem. I was recommended through Kayak, which has never presented a problem. The customer service reps all seemed to be just as confused and speaking with a supervisor was of no help whatsoever.
1	"Skypicker does not send the passengers' contact details to airlines while booking but uses their own. With this comes some responsibility. On this basis a flight broker is obliged to forward all information they receive for the passenger regarding changes in flight schedule, especially cancelled flights to said passenger. Skypicker never did. Although RyanAir had timely informed them via SMS and e-mail of the cancellation of my connecting flight due to aircontroller strikes, Skypicker never bothered to inform me. Had they done so, I could have reacted by rerouting at reasonable prices and would have got my money back for the cancelled flight as well.As it was, after the first leg of my journey I was totally stumped when I was greeted with flashing ""cancelled"" signs and found myself stranded in Bergamo, Italy. I had to wait in line for five hours to have RyanAir staff present me with proof of their messages to Skypicker. I had a hotel and a car booked and paid for that day in Sicily and thus could not take up RyanAir's offer to wait two days for the next flight. The only option was to book a flight for that night myself and change airports.Now, Skypicker refuses to cooperate and pay for the consequences of their failure as a broker by reimbursing me for the additional costs. Their justification, ""not part of our terms and conditions"". With this sort of carelesness, abysmal customer service and argumentation any journey booked through them turns out to be a gamble. I'd strongly advise against using Skypicker."
5	Dealt with their customer representative Nina Kasap regarding baggage allowance and the matter was dealt with positively in less than 24 hours. Our thanks and appreciation. Cheers, Bev ü
4	Thanks Lucas for Helping us!
5	Booked with <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> for the first time, the process was very easy and communication was outstanding.  The airline changed the flight time of my connecting flight and Kiwi informed me immediately and helped with alternate arrangements.  Probably the best online travel experience I could have expected; they met and exceeded every expectation.  Even better, their outstanding service continues after your trip.  I would recommend Kiwi to anyone, and will continue to use them myself.
5	I had reservation chat with Igor Guzvinec ... he was absolutely helpful, very patient and most of all cared for what he was doing to ensure that from such a far distance away , he is making me feel very safe in the communication between KIWI and myself.Thanks a million Igor 10 out of 10
5	#Skypicker, 3 yr old Czech startup unearths flights, fly as cheaply as you want, and for 1st time in US. <https://t.co/tAeoN5lTiA>
5	Awesome customer support! Everything done within 10 minutes! Love it!
5	I spent a little over an hour on an online chat with Alex A. He did a wonderful job of trying to work with me to help out with adding luggage to my itinerary. I have to admit I did not receive the pricing I would have liked, but Alex was patient with my frustrations and did a fantastic job trying to help me. Skypicker definitely has better customer service than most other booking websites.
5	Very good service and Olga Muzychuk helped me with online checking and it was very fast without any problems or issues.
5	Very helpful agents, good prices, for sure I will use them again ! :)
5	Both of the girls I chatted with helped me above and beyond what I expected.  I'm disabled and they were able to answer and fix problems I was having. They researched until they could fine the answers I needed, and notified the airline of my needs. All I can say is thank you from the bottom of my heart.
1	"I had a serious problem with my booking #320332I was supposed to fly from Bangkok to Auckland, but when I arrived in Sydney - the second stop - for my surprise I couldn't make my and my boyfriend's check-in because our names were wrong in the reservation. The thing is: our names were wrong because your website has a poor Portuguese translation, which is actually a mix between Portuguese and Spanish. A lot of words are similar but with really different meanings.The part where I should fill the first name (please see the attachment) is written ""Nome Próprio"", which means in Portuguese the whole name and the part that should be the surname, is written ""apelido"" which means in Portuguese nickname.Apelido in Spanish means surname, and not in Portuguese. Unfortunately, we didn't know it before.""Apelido"" or surname in Portuguese is Sobrenome. So different of ""apelido"", isn't it?Therefore, my boyfriend filled up our names wrong because you induced us to make this mistake with this wrong translation. You are the responsible for this big troubleThe name change was not possible because these flights that we bought are low cost, and it is not allowed.As we had to fly immediately to Auckland because we had a flight to Brazil on the next day, we desperately looked for other flight and we had to buy other tickets to fly to Auckland.Also, I have nervous stomach gastritis and this stressful situation made it worst. Can you imagine me with this disease in this situation? Without money (otherwise I hadn't bought low cost tickets) in the end of my trip, tired, 2 flights after, one day flying, plus 3 more flights and 2 more days to come back home, really worried about to lose my flight back to Brazil. Desperate to find the next flight to Auckland?So, I asked for the refund about the replacement tickets that we had to buy in order to not lose our flight to come back home because of your wrong translation. We had to ask money borrowed for our relatives because we haven't this money to pay the invoice.In addition to stress and nervous we had the embarrassment borrowing money. The travel that we planned for one year saving money supposed be happy and wonderful, but this problem is keep making it stressful and frustrating.You said that my ""refund application will be processed within 5 business days"" and today is the 7th business day since I made the refund aplication and I didn't have any contact yet.I understand that all companies have problems but what makes difference is how they solve them."
5	i just want to say that everyone in kiwi's team are absolutely amazing, i had an issue where the airline changed my morning flight to an evening one, once i contacted kiwi to find me a substitute flight they replied on my email very fast and helped me to resolve my issue. special thanks to Sabina, Daria, Pavel, and Olena for the amazing customer service's experience. kiwi is the best
1	My flight from Rome to Dublin was delayed on the Rome end and I missed my flight from Brussels to Dublin. I did not know I would miss my flight until mid flight when I asked the steward. There were many people on my flight in the same situation. When we landed, we were focused on getting the next flight (as were many others).  There were no flights until Thursday - no, I did not call Kiwi. It didn't occur to me in the stress of the situation. My focus was getting a flight & my exhausted children to a hotel to rest. This is the shameful practice kiwi uses. Be sure to call them, otherwise you're out of luck. So, weary, stressed traveler, be sure to remember that little detail or no refund for you!Believe it if not, that's not what I am most upset about. Kiwi's communication is dreadful! At every turn, I had to contact kiwi first in order to get any answers even when they promised to contact me within the next 24 hours. Isn't this ironic? In order to get a refund, I have to contact kiwi immediately but they don't contact me at all? Shameful!!!! I contacted kiwi around 7:30-8:00 am the very next day (7/19). I sent my receipts as requested. I was assured I would hear from kiwi in the next 5 days - no contact. I contacted them and they told me they didn't get my receipts (7/25). They didn't let me know that until I contacted them (???)! Sent the receipts again. On Aug 1st, again, they didn't have my receipts. In the course of the conversation, they found them. Again, I contacted them! I contacted them AGAIN, on Aug 5th. Was told I would get a refund for Brussels-Dublin only. I questioned this and kiwi sent it back for further review. Aug 6th - received my first email from kiwi asking for my bank information. I questioned them about the refund & they assured me they would get back to me - they NEVER did!!!I contacted them on Aug 17th - was told someone would contact me in the next 24 hours - no one did!Aug 19th - contacted kiwi again. Told them no one got back to me. Was told it could take up to 30 days. I let them know we were at the 30 day mark. Sept 2nd - contacted kiwi again. Was informed again that I would only get a refund for Brussels to Dublin. Made it very clear I was disappointed and that the communication was awful. Shame on kiwi - I would use s different s company. Will NOT recommend to others! Remember the lesson here - do as I say (contact me first!) not as I do (no contact to the customer)!!!
3	Skypicker offers flights for up to 90 percent less with a cloud-based ticketing portal <https://t.co/bpool559Pe>
5	Maria was very patient with answering my queries and had given me helpful directions to settle my problems. Good customer service overall. :)
4	I booked 2 stops flight with two different operators where I received boarding ticket for one and instructions about getting boarding pass at airport. 3 hours before depature I arrived at airport and got information that I haven't any ticket, so Kiwi made a mistake. I tried to call the hotline but just waited 20 min in waiting line. So I booked new ticket for 1780 EUR to take my travel.After my return I complained and only received 780 EUR as refund, after a call to ask the reason I also got rest 1000 EUR back very fast and without any further complain.So all in one Kiwi is trustable and responsable!
5	I spoke to two reps: IRIC and NATALY and they were AWESOME!!!! Helpful, attentive, very clear  and well mannered! You cannot find service like this, I know! I worked ten years in call centers including Dell computers, <http://Hotels.com|Hotels.com>, <http://Expedia.com|Expedia.com>, Metlife and At&T.GIVE THESE TWO REPS A SALARY RAISE! They need to be supervisors as soon as possible!
5	Miroslava P on the online chat helped me, and answered the questions I had.
5	This evening I had two queries for skypicker so I used their online customer support application. Lusine was my agent and she was extremely quick, helpful, and very friendly. She didnt make me feel like I was talking to an automated machine and was eager to make sure that I had all the answer I required. Thanks Skypicker!
5	I received excellent service from Lorena G. in getting an error I made on my booking corrected. Very quick and easy resolution.
5	Thanks Neil for the service given. And solving the problem of the boarding pass that was not made.
5	I booked a flights but i had few mistakes in the information. So i had to call the customer service, and a guy called Serhiy was the represinter for me. He was helping me so perfectly. He was Replying fast, fixing the problem within minutes. Appreciate the hard work and i do appreciate how great helping customers is in this company. Best of wishes.
5	Me girlfriend made a mistake and wrote the booking number instead of the passport number and we contacted them the day before our flight and they managed to fix that, thanx for Tamara who helped us with the info correcting m, otherwise we would have been charged at the airport for having wrong papers and etc. GREAT customer support! Much appreciated!
5	I just use the online service to manage my luggage and to check about the price for the extra one, i was really asking a lot of questions and Natalya was still very kind and helpful by checking and doing everything for me. She was soo helpful for because I can't find something on the web side she explains everything to me. Very good for you to have that kind of hard worker in you company. Thank you Natalya for making my flight easier. :*
5	I chatted in with Adam, he was very polite and quickly answered all my questions. Will return to this site for future purchases!
5	The website is limited but they have good costumer care agents by phone. I had some complications and a lovely French guy called Eric solved it nicely. He was very polite and made my day.
5	Big thanks to Pavel Fridrich for saving my ass!!!!
4	There's one boarding pass that didn't get sent to us, however we were still checked in online so the inconvenience was only very slight. Otherwise very happy with service.
5	I'm really pleased with the service that the agent Mr. Luis Silva provided, it was useful, very efficient and  solved my problem.Best regards.Bruno Soutinho
5	I bought flight tickets trough <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>. After I booked I noticed that I had booked the flights home for the wrong date. I connected to the customer service chat and were offered the most professional, kind and great service by Tomas L. I hope he gets the Christmas bonus this year. He deserves it.
5	Very helpful, fast service. No problems at all. Would use services again and also recommend.
5	I am very satisfied with the service. All I had to do was to book my flight I didn't have to remember when to check or spend any time to it as it all was managed by SkyPicker. Definitely will use it for my next booking.
5	I was satisfied with Skypicker services, thank you.
4	Fantastic live chat service and Mohammed is efficient, effective and extremely helpful. Thanks, Mohammed for being so helpful and for dealing with my request really quickly.
5	They helped me in 11th hour. Truly commendable
4	Me and my husband  got fast and easy help in their online chat to check in and get the boarding card to print  by Lusine, thank you!

5	It's been an absolute pleasure dealing with <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> from the simple intuitive booking process to professional customer service. As a frequent traveller myself, I value customer service above all, and the only way for one booking company to distinguish themselves from another. Mr. Tomas Jurik at <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> has been particularly outstanding and gone over and beyond in terms of customer excellence. My 81 year old grandmother needed special assistance due to her limited mobility & Tomas Jurik assisted us in every way possible:- organised the check in & emailed the boarding passes- Investigated the possible baggage re-check in transit- requested special wheelchair assistance- double checked all details - follow up of service Tomas is a great ambassador for <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> and I wouldn't hesitate in recommending <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> to a fellow traveller. Thank you for putting our family's mind at peace. Kind regards,Anca & Elena
5	Varvara was awesome! I was confused about about my three connecting flights and their different carry-on/ checked luggage policies and what I had to pay and she helped me figure everything out and which airlines I had to pay for and which I didn't! Would definitely book with Kiwi again!
2	A startup that finds 'hidden' discount flight tickets just launched in the US <https://t.co/859sPV56Gj> via @sai
5	I've made some error about my booking detail  n quickly made a webchat to request some revision. Ms. Irina as the operator is really helpful. Nice job ms. Irina.
1	Booking 2053211. My wifes order through <http://Finn.no|Finn.no> reiser and their supplier <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> for her and daughter was put on hold because of an obscure security check. We did not get a ticket, the amount is still reserved on credit card. We needed to go home fast. Because of kiwi we had to stay because the obscure security check took 18 hours before we had to cancel the order, meanwhile there was no available tickets. Husband (me) ordered booking separate through Kiwi could not use his own ticket (booking 2053362) and lost 880 Euro. I have never experienced something like this.
4	Skypicker (like many 3rd party travel sites) uses their own email for booking, so you can unfortunately not manage your own booking directly with the airline. This is a problem for adding bags at the last minute. Skypicker should take a look at a workaround for this, but in the meantime, Tomas in their webchat customer service department was able to go the extra mile to help me out and add a last-minute checked bag to my reservation. Many thanks to Tomas!
4	In the middle of my first ticket debacle, skypicker has lost my business and I might get charged Ryanairs bogus check in fee
4	Travelling around India was made very easy with <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> as to work it all out myself would have been a nightmare.
5	Thanks Aura : )
5	I usually don't write reviews, but after chatting with Alan for a few minutes, and watching in amazement as he navigated my complex flight order (7 in total!) flawlessly, I felt compelled to let the world know how well he handled the situation. I thought customer service was a lost art, but he has open my eyes and allowed me to put my faith back in others. Thank you, Alan, and Godspeed.-Alex
5	Only have had an amazing hassle free business win Kiwi
1	Not satisfied ... I took a ticket to go from Amsterdam to Madrid and from Madrid to Amsterdam (via London). The first flight (Amsterdam to Madrid), I didn't have any problem.The second one (last Sunday) was more complicated. I had a flight from Madrid to London Gatwick. This flight got delayed (it arrived at 17.57 instead of 16.20). My connection was at 18.30 but time to go out of the plane and go to the other terminal, my flight was gone. i was panicked as no one helped me in the airport and it was the first time something like this happened. So I went to see the company with who I have my second flight (my priority was to come back to Holland because I worked on Monday morning) - they offered me another flight the day after which means that I had to take an hotel. I checked with the airport in general but no flights were available before Monday morning to go to Amsterdam. I paid the other flight and the hotel thinking that someone will pay it back to me as the missing flight was not my fault. I didn't think of calling Skypicker because it was the first time I had this problem, I was in a country which is not mine and I only wanted to come back to be able to work the day after. So I contacted Skypicker less than 24 hours after that (on Monday afternoon) and they reimbursed me the price of the flight that I missed which represents 77 euros knowing that I had to pay 200 euros (other flight + hotel). They told me that I had to contact them but I thought they were not available because my flight problem was on Sunday evening and on the e ticket they said to call them immediately if you have a problem but they don't say they are available 24/7 so now I have 120 euros that I had to pay for something where I had no control... So good company until you have a problem!
5	I had a check in question and called for answer.  Call was answered immediately, efficient voice instructions and instantly connected to a GREAT and COMPETENT customer service agent named Lorena.  She was efficient, answered my question promptly, cheerfully, and correctly!SOOO Pleased ... I am first time user of <http://KIWI.com|KIWI.com> and absolutely will bookmark this company site and use it regularly !!!Thanks, Kiwi!
5	These guys saved my life with their incredible service. Due to the incompetence of Bravofly I was stranded in Mexico and could not afford to leave on time to make it to my visa appointment in Germany and then enter this amazing company. Not only do they give you great prices and a myriad options they are also super accommodating. I needed extra luggage and a series of services that should normally be no problem but due to me buying the ticket 2 days before departing it would have been complicated, but they handled everything amazingly! I cannot recommend a company more than them. Also, they are available 24/7 free of cost. I will always buy my trips with them.
5	I would like to thank very much to Mr. Martin Čermák for helping me with my problem with boarding passes.
5	Finding the ticket is the easiest ever. Perfect
5	Just had en excellent experience with customer service by a very serviceminded man with the name Selorm.
5	Thank you BOGDAN again for your availability.It was quick and friendly.Professionalism is your nickname. Explained everything clear and short . It was exactly what I was looking for.Thanks again !
5	Neil Camilleri and Jan Lukasek helped me professionally to solve my problems by chat. Now I hope no further issues will pop up.
5	Thank you Mohamed Abdelkader for your help, I'm more than pleased with your assistance.
5	What I can see in this company that many persons working hard but very little working from
1	"I have now tried to book two tickets with the same result. The web page showed a price, but when the order was confirmed and my money was withdrawn from my account, I get a message two hours later saying that there has been a price change on the ticket of approximately +25% extra. I then have the option of accepting this price change or get my money back, just be aware that the reverse transaction can take up to 10 working days. I then look at the web page and see the exact same flight, now just cheaper than before.. I ask the support team if they can just change my booking to that one, disregarding the lower price - so I don't have to make a double transaction from my account, but the answer is just the standard: ""you can only chose between the two"".I then chose to get my money back (in 10 working days) and order a new, cheaper, ticket. Same thing happens, only that it takes them three hours to tell me the exact same thing again.I read in one of skypicker's replies to a Trustpilot-comment, that the airplane company changes prices up to 12 times a day? - well, no wonder the price changed in my booking if it took them three hours just to get the tickets...  I am now forced to buy a more expensive ticket somewhere else because I can't trust their service. The whole concept of their business is really good; offering cheaper solutions, but when it doesn't work, it doesn't work (I am glad that it did for someone). Maybe they should hold the transaction of people's money until they actually confirm the bookings? My experience of buying a ticket from Skypicker is like lending money to a total stranger, with negative interests, and hoping to get them back (a bad business, if you ask me).I can only give them 1 star, based on the fact that I was not able to purchase a ticket without an added price on 25% after buying them, and plane tickets from the Philippines to Europe are not cheap.The worst thing about it all; the price is at it cheapest now on their web page, 12 hours later after first trying to book it."
1	Terrible customer service. They don't even offer the best offer. When you find the best offer (too late) by yourself and ask for a change of booking (flight way much cheaper that the one they sold you), they just offer you to buy a new ticket with a ridiculous refund (5% of the initial amount)The customer service employee on the chat wasn't really friendly and stopped the conversation when I probably bothered him for too long...DON'T USE THIS WEBSITE
5	I had some system-related problems ith my bookings and I have recieved great assistance on livehelp desk, very pleasant experience. Skypicker is really great and well working company and its pleasure flying with them. 5*

5	I booked less than a week before my departure, it would cost 1.5 times with other ways of booking, but Skypicker save me a lot. Highly recommended if you are in a hurry to fly.
5	Very professional,helpful and competent personal!Lots of time I needed to ask or to answer,but hadn't opportunity to call.I opened chat and all time I received help.Thank <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> and more bigger thank for operators in chat  Maria,Lucie,Lenka, Jolana, Selorm,Věra, Lukas N., Lukas P., Dominika!!!Best regards!

5	Very happy with the customer assistance at Kiwi. Received a handful and immediate support from Joao Carreira, whom I really thank.
4	Skypicker provided cheap flights with acceptable airlines who gave us no problems. Using this service was a good way to find a good deal
5	This review is for Veronika, with whom I chatted over their Live Chat. Response was very quick, and she was very professional and courteous. She answered all of my questions quickly and effectively. I haven't yet taken my flight, but hopefully it goes as smoothly as my conversation with Veronika.
5	I was so relieved by the helpfullness and pleasantness of their serivce staff .. service awas FAST and EFFICIENT !!
1	I booked a flight with this company one week ago. They took my money but the next day they told me I couldn't have my tickets for that price and so I could either pay more or accept a refund. I asked for the refund and they told me that the time for the refund was 1-5 days. Today I am still waiting for the refund and the worst thing is that I wrote them 2 e-mails and they are not answering me!
1	ATTENTION ATTENTION ITS A FAKE COMPANYFirst use Money from the card, after 1 hour later say its cost 50€ more...When you want canceled, its say need 10 days to come the money back to my credit card. But my payment was in seconds. I write the service but they are ignored. Care about and not buy or pay with this company!
4	I was glad i was able to talk to a person who help me with my issue today, I thought i would not be able to finish my task today, thanks to Jiří Červenka he helped me in the best way he can, KUDOS if i may say, i hope that the skypicker would give importance to you fellows that are doing their best to help us, specially me since this is my first flight with you, i hope to travel more soon! :)
4	Had a problem with the issuance of my boarding card, but it was quickly solved with the online support via chat by Nikola.Thanks a lot ; )
5	Hey there... thank you RADEK for a great service! Good man out there!  Helped me sort my ebooking-mess!
5	I experienced some difficulty in reviewing my change before paying for it. And Milica, after asked me carefully about my situation, helped me to delete the change so I can do it again to make sure my change is correct.You're great, Milica!
1	"DON'T safe money and book ""cheap"" tickets with skypicker- you will pay extra afterwards! I had a nightmare at the airport in MDL, myanmar- realising that my flight to hong kong has not been cancelled, the direct connection did not even exist! as online check-in is not provided you can not be prepared for that.calling the call center did not help in this situation- they said that they were not informed about the cancellation by the airline- wich turned out to be wrong- as the airline (hongkongexpress) proofed about informing skypicker later. Unfortunately no one informed the customer!  Furthermore they could not provide any alternative itinerary.As there was no direct connection existing at all- I had to organise two additional tickets spontaneously by myself to approach my final destination- an additional cost of 420 EUR.The sum of the total refund is peanuts- the max refund is double the price of the ""non existing"" flight ticket- which was 70 Eur- makes 140 Eur in total.So the extra amount for me is still 280 EUR- 4 times the price of the actual ticket!As I am a student I went for the cheapest ticket- it ended up in a very exhausting trip, paying the highest price in the end. I would definitely not recommend!!!!!"
5	I would to thank skypicker and more spcefically Martin Carter for his attention and helpfulness provided.He was always present, trying to help us and making everything easier.Thank you Martin
5	Well, I had a problem trying to access my account and I used the live chat to try to solve the problem as fast as possible and in the same minute someone replied me and explained that everything was alright and that I didn't need to worry about that!Once more, thank you very much for your attention and help!
5	Recieved the absolute best chat support help from a lad named Sam!! thank your very much my friend! Thumbs UP! ;D
5	I write in the chat online to resolve a problem with my reservation flight and Filip answer me just fews minutes later, he has been very kind and polite make a great work and help me suddenly. Thank you very much :)
5	Thank you, first time booking with you, I had an inconvenience and your fine employee Daniel Petar has definitely exceeded my expectations! I'm pleased and satisfied with the competence and patience showed, well done!
4	Hi had a complicated situation and all the chat customer care team were amazing. Dorota was very friendly and as we were waiting for things to go through so kindly gave me recommendations about what I can do while I'm away.

5	Hi my name is Rachel, by mistake I typed my email address incorrectly so I didn't get my e-flight ticket. However Michaela Ondraskova from support team contacted me back and helped me to work it out. Thank you!
5	Great website allowing you to book flights with different carriers in one transaction. Saved me a huge amount of money on a recent flight as they also use budget airlines. Boarding pass emailed beforehand as stated. Had no problems and would use again.
4	Spoke with their customer support online today and they were very helpful. Great service.
5	thanks Irina

2	"I have tried very hard to make a slight change to a reservation, and the staff at the call center tells me everything is not possible. It seems very scripted, but I cannot seem to get past the ""travel consultants"" that are clearly unable to come up with real solutions."
1	Don't ever book your tickets through this company. Their customer service isn't even worth one star.
5	#skypicker for the win!
5	Great deal for me me.Excelent price and good customer service!
5	Skypicker has great customer service, I was answer in within 6 hours about my issue with my ticket. I had put in the wrong email and Anastasiia Kopivska kindly changed it and informed me on how to check in for my flight.
5	I would like to thank Lenka the agent who helpd me even though i didnt get what i needed because of the airline policy (viva colombia which is a terible company) i got all the information i could get in the matter.
4	Great service by Patrick! Well done!
3	Spent 3 days chatting online with their team and they could solved my issues. Then, I got Vally on the phone and he put lot of effort trying to solve my problem. Problem solved. Thanks Vally.
5	Best customer service I have ever get in life, I will recommend to anybody in the world keep the good work going.

5	I had a plan to go to Taiwan from Singapore via Thailand, but first flight was too late and I missed second flight and what was worse there were nobody to help me because they got off work at 11:00pm.So, I'm very embarrassed and couldn't help waiting to morning. However I thought that trying wouldn´t hurt and tried to livechat on Skypicker. Finally, I got new ticket to Taipei from Skypicker less than two hours and they provide cost to transfer.
5	Easy to review booking details and easy to follow through once at airport.  No issues at all.  Thank you so much.  Would not hesitate to use again and again.
5	Experienced some questions about my flights, support team helped me to figure out and solve everything. Thanks, Anna!

1	"I requested to have seats assigned when I bought my tickets over a month ago, because I'm traveling with a minor . So far they haven't been able to do it and I'm leaving on Tuesday. Their answer ""sorry, our mistake, be patient, we'll put an urgency not to your request"" and that's it. I also added a piece of luggage yesterday, and it's still being processed.  The travel consultant was not useful at all to solve the problems. At least she was nice."
5	Adam Jelinek does a great work at <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> The agent had clear answers for all my enquiries, he's reliable and quick, fulfilled all my requests politely and solved an issue with online checkin availability for my flight. the only agent that answered clearly for me on the issue! Ask for him!
1	I purchased a two part flight from Nice to Argostoli,when I received the confirmation email the flight was not via Stansted as I had booked but a two stop via Milan and Brussels and took from 9.50 in morning to the following day As this was for my young daughter I rang within 2hours to say they had given me the wrong flight They were not at all helpful and took forty eight hours to offer me a part flight change at 115 euros I could buy the flight from Ryanair for less the delay cost me more money as flight prices went up while I was waiting for a resolutionDO NOT USE THIS WEBSITE BOOK YOUR FLIGHTS DIRECT WITH AIRLINES AND IF THERE IS A MISTAKE IT CAN BE REFUNDED WITHIN 24hours

5	I made a mistake in a flight reservation shortly after making it, and the staff at Kiwi was so helpful and professional in solving my problem. I am so used to being let down by travel companies, thatI was sincerely at a loss for words when they were able to help me out in such a short amount of time. I am definitely going to recommend Kiwi to my friends! Thank you Lucie and Lorena so much for your help!

5	I want to thank Selrom and Monika for their service they were really  helpful and really friendly, thank you for helping me so fast and for being patient with me
1	I booked my tickets for a flight and was charged the amount on my credit card. Later that night, I received an email saying the price changed and I now had to pay more money or cancel the flight. The link no longer worked when I went to pay it.Talked with support 2x and nothing happened — no real help was provided to solve it. I then received a call from them saying the price changed again (this time 4x more than last time, an extra $115 CAD)...Will never use this service again. I just wasted so much time and energy on this and didn't get even close to the price that I was expecting from the service.
5	Good service, no hidden fees. Would use again
4	Prices were good, and the customer service representative who helped me was wonderful (Eva). However, there is a downside to purchasing tickets at such a low rate: cancelling or refunding, or generally using the credit elsewhere is not possible. This is in their terms of service and is perfectly reasonable, but a financial issue caught me by surprise and now I'm left with tickets I may not be able to use.  :Ptl;dr: Good prices, good service, but no refunds or cancellations.
1	I was unaware that I needed to respond with in 12 hours to confirm a booking number for a flight after entering all my information including my license number.Upon calling the business to see if my transaction could be further processed I was told no and that it was for security and that it was now my banks problem if I wanted to have my money back in less than 10 DAYS. In 10 DAYS the price for my flight will be higher so in the end this company has wasted my time and more money.
3	"We are very unsatisfied with Skypicker. We are still waiting for an airline refund from a flight in November. We had everything settled with the airline already (including the statement that which amount we will be refunded), but Skypicker told us that they would have to conduct the refund. Since then literally nothing has happened except for emails such as ""we are investigating the matter"". We would and will never book with Skypicker again"
5	nice friendly help from live chat, was atended by Ivana V, all my questions were answered quickly and fast service for sorting out my problem, would recomend, thanks
5	Elsa C was my customer service rep and she was very kind and helpful. Excellent customer service at this company!
4	Thank you Nino K. for clarifying my query politely and efficiently via live chat.
5	Skypicker customer service reps are the BEST!!  Thank you for helping me so efficiently.  I'm not great with computer-related stuff, but my Skypicker hero basically did it all for me.
5	I was really glad for such fast and nice service from agent Alan Whitfield who helped me with extra information needed for my flight. Thanks again. :)

Thank you! look forward to booking with <http://skypicker.com|skypicker.com> again soon!!Katherine Hutnik
5	My son's flight was cancelled due to a winter storm, so the Kiwi agent assisted me in finding an alternate flight. It was all new to me, but she was extremely helpful and stayed on the chat until I received the new e-ticket!
5	I called the service centre with a badly worded and confusing explanation of my problem with new boarding passes and luggage issues, which I projected to Dorota Žigová in a minute long monologue. She barely skipped a beat, payed full attention and interpreted my issue, she took maybe 30 seconds to explain to me how she would solve it and what I should expect. All with a friendly voice and attitude. In half a minute everything was sorted and organised and she big me a good day. Excellent service! Thank you  Dorota
1	My flight today was postponed 10 hours, and I didn't get any information. The only solution according to <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> was that I could buy new tickets to an earlier flight at my own cost. Seems that this company is not serious at all, and that they don't care about their customers..
5	I had a very good and helpful experience talking to Enri A on the online chat. They were really helpful, polite and efficient. Excellent service!
1	Terrible experience with Skypicker.Could not check in online because they didn't provide us with the correct information, and then we all incurred a £45 charge EACH (more than the cost of the flight) to check in at the airport because online check-in was compulsory (we weren't made aware of this either).
5	Great communication, thanks to Neil who solved my problem so quickly!
5	This is my first experience with Skypicker, and I had a number of questions after making my reservations.  I was very pleased with the help I received from the customer service rep--Mario. I really appreciated his patience, as we worked through the problem I was having.  Thank you, Mario, and thank you, Skypicker!
5	:D well I have some question and Anastassia and Johana and another Miss were very friendly and with a lot of patience resolve all my questions and help me with one mistake :D I think it´s really good I recomended
4	Skypicker flights were a good value and I recommend the service.
4	Until now I never had any problem concerning this company and the truth is that it's very comfortable to book on their website and then the tickets are sent to your inbox ready to print. This time the ticket part didn't work but contacting the customer service through the  chat, the issue was solved rapidly. Thank you very much Pavel!!!

5	Quick and to the point. Helped me out!
2	Good services except if you have an extra item you want to bring with you on the flight. They will ask you to pay for it but they don't check before with the flight companies. So, like it happens for me, you can be obliged to pay twice. First with Kiwi and a second time with the company.Thanks to Veronika from the Chat on Kiwi's website. Hopefully they have a good helpcenter.
5	I was having trouble with my check in luggage. Since it was my first time using skypicker, i was really anxious. I tried using the chat option, and in the first few minutes i thought that i will just be talking to a system generated response, then Alexey T. answered, then all my anxiety went away. She was patient with me answered my concerns. I will definitely recommend skypicker to my friends and family
5	... I thought i have a Problem but then i meet this guy Lucas and he was my Angel Was a good Serves! Fast Help! anf a very friendly guy!Thx to the Company and specialy to lucas
1	No reason given, they cost me at least $500 today. PLEASE DONT USE THEM. They're based out of the Czech Republic!
5	all the service was quick and smooth. i really appreciate the work they have done for me.i definitely want to use the website again, if i travel next time.
4	I was able to conveniently chat with Martin Carter who was extremely helpful! He was not only kind and responsive, but he did his best to help me out with my travel issues. I was disappointed that the grace period to cancel my flight only lasted 24 hours though. Other than that, the customer service was great and I appreciated Martin's help a lot! GO MARTIN! YOU ROCK!
5	I was given a superb customer service by Polina and Kostya. They went above and beyond their call of duty to assist me through my difficulties.I commend <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> any time.
1	I looked for a ticket at the Skyscanner and was redirected to <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com>. I could choose another one, but I didn't, and I'm here now. So bought the ticket and recived a message confirming the operation. 20 minutes later, I received a new email saying that they were a problem with the airline, but that would soon be resolved. However, I saw that he had made a mistake one hour later and asked the clerk if I could change the ticket for another time and if there would be any charge. If the price increase, I would not cancel the ticket. She said that would give me an answer later. The answer was that the price would be higher. I then said he did not want and could be the start time, then she said I would have to pay more because the passage had risen. When I refused to pay the more they said they would return my money. Now that the passage is more expensive. I am angry because I failed to buy into other companies and at the time the ticket was cheaper.
5	its my first time that i flight with kiwi and i very stisfied with the service.i just speak wite their agent Babak and he help me what i want .very good service
5	Best customer support I had so far: one day before our departure (ryan air) we realized we have not put our passport details on the kiwi due to travelling and lack of internet (they could ask for that information right with the booking though). therefore our boarding passes could not be delivered. At 10pm (8hours before the flight, I contacted the Livechat (did not have much hope at this point) but I was positively surprised. To make make it short, within a short period of time our boarding tickets have been issued AND the correct luggage was checked in (our mistake, we only booked 15kg instead of 20kg). I have to say a big thank you to: Katarina Sochova. She answered quick, smart and proactively. Something I have not seen with any other flight booking service so far! Keep it up!
4	I thank Jan S. very much for clarifying all my doubts, giving my full attention to my requests and helping me updating important flight information. Excellent job
1	I wanted to change the dates on my itinerary before the 24 hr. deadline, Lucie came back with an alternate itinerary and I emailed her back immediately to book the new itinerary. But nothing was done and now I lost the money I paid for this booking. incompetence, lazyness and tons of excuses, I won't book with these people again.
5	It was cheap, without meals and drinks as expected. Wtih no bags as expected for that price, I could check everything online, only thing I mind I could not acces one of my boarding pass.
5	Thanks you ! They make all the it can be possible to do for make be at my destination for a 5 places trip take the days vefore with plane delay cancel etc alway someone for help by phone of chat and when they say they will do it and call you after be sure that they do it !

5	Barbara Kubešová, a Senior Travel Consultant with Kiwi was wonderful. On my behalf she took quite a lot tf time to be sure I had the information I needed and emailed me promptly. A polite and friendly manner makes all the difference.. It's a pleasure for me to talk to such people. And what she couldn't answer she found out for me. Thank you Barbara, I will certainly rebook with Kiwi.
5	Booked our tickets from Barcelona to Edmonton without any problems. This company also has a live chat on their website which made things so much easier when we had questions about our etickets. Thanks skypicker!
5	I chatted with Tomas about some questions I had about my boarding pass and luggage and he was very helpful.
5	Everything went super smooth.
1	Flying from Tijuana to Cancun on May 26, 2016, we found out at check-in that our flight had been cancelled due to airport construction.  We had not advance notice of such cancellation.  It took us four (4) phone calls to Skypicker/Kiwi.com to get them to reschedule our flight.  Each time a representative would state that they were working on it and would call us back within an hour.  They never called back and seemed to be shaking us off the phone each time with empty promises.  Four phone calls, many frustrated hours later, and through our persistence they reschedule our flight.  This should have been easily addressed in one phone call and, frankly, was something they could have prevented through rescheduling in advance of the flight.  Overall our experience with with customer service was terrible and we arrived to our destination 24 hours later than planned.  I will never use Skypicker/Kiwi.com again and would advise others to stay away.
5	it was my first time using skypicker. They provide kind&fast services so that I want to use their services next time I want to give a special thanks to Yuriy N.
5	Lukas, the person who helped me was polite and answered my questions clearly and fast. Was a goos experience.
4	Very helpful staff, ready to offer advice and alternatives at any hour!
5	Natalya P. provided me good information and services. I really appreciated with this service.
2	I booked a flight for my boyfriend and I but the online check in has been made initially only for me as my boyfriend's passport details were still missing. That means I had to call the customer service and ask to do the check in online for him separately resulting in getting separate seats. It would have made sense to send a reminder BEFORE the online check in was made for me.I just wouldn't use this website anymore as booking directly with the airline company is just better as you would the check in for both at the same time. Never had any issue like this before booking directly with an airline.The only positive note I have to make is the customer support received by Eric who's been very helpful.
1	I bought a flight with <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> 3 months ago, but the flight was cancelled. I really needed to flight that day, so I ask to the staff what to do. They answered “you can buy a new flight and we will refund you the money of that flight”. Everything OK.The real problem is to get that refund. After the flight, <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> told me that they only can give me just a part of the money.After a lots of mails, they accepted to give me 428 EUR. (of a total of 630 EUR) and 50 EUR in credits due they “forgot” transfer the money for weeks.I repeat, this was 3 months ago and until now I still don´t have all the money (not even the money they promised!), missing 117 EUR of the 428 EUR!They have a terrible costumer service. I have been sending mails for all this time, wasting a lot of time and energy, asking for the money they promised to give me and now they don`t even answer the mails.I`m a traveller who have been traveling around the world for 9 months, buying a lots a flights of different companies, and never have too many problems like I have with <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>. They don`t care about the clients who already paid, they just want your money and then they forget everything about you.If you will buy flight I can recommend you to buy with another agency.
5	One of my flight was delayed. As a result I missed my connecting flight. I contacted Kiwi's support center and received immidiate help. The service was personalized and humane. Thank you Marla for a job well done!
5	I had a issue that i needed solved immediately and James Tickner provided fantastic service.  He resolved the issue and followed up with email to ensure that all went smoothly.  Great stuff
5	when i contacted to kiwi for changing my flight schedule,i met  Vlad.Although my English is not enough to conversation,  Vlad was still kind.So i finally can get a few option to change!thank you Vlad! and i want to say i felt your kindness.and also thank for kiwi that match me to Vlad.
2	Email issue resolved, working hard to resolve all delayed requests. Please call us for any urgent questions on your booking. Skypicker team

4	Very good service. Given good direction for what to do and got informed for the policy of the company! Direct feedback and was given flexibility for solutions !Last, it would be nice to have customers from GR the option of getting informed through free call service
5	Delayed flights turned into missed connections, but Hana solved it quickly and without fuss over a short chat-session. Arrived at my destination only a few hours after the planned time! Will use Kiwi next time I'm flying!
5	Easy to say thank you very much indeed to all of your great team, really professional, kind and helpful! Well done!!!
5	The service is so nice. They respond to the customer immediately via online or email. Book with this agency and you won't regret it.
5	I had a big problem with a online checkin but i get a online chat with very helpful Miroslav. I really appreciate his work and what he done for me. That is why i can travel to se my son.I really recommand Wiki and Miroslav !!!
5	I bought tickets to Cairns via Bali, and was very concerned because the Bali airport had been closed for a few days due to the volcanic ash making flights unsafe. I dropped an email to Skypicker to check if I would have a problem with my flights, one of the customer service persons came back and said that the airport was cleared for travel the night before and not sure if it would change the next day. And when it was sure that it would the following day, Daniel H. made a couple of failed attempts to contact me via my mobile and he then sent me an email to inform me of the bad news, but at the same time, he offered me an alternative flight schedule that would still bring me to Cairns the next day, albeit a bit longer. I was grateful and advised him to book it. He did that and gave me a call and emailed the new flight bookings. I was delighted to be upgraded to Singapore Airlines and Virgin from AirAsia and Jetstar. On top of that, the baggage allowance had increased for the normal services airlines. I was ecstatic and grateful for Danial for making the effort to ensure that my holiday plans weren't disrupted majorly! Couldn't have done this when I tried calling Airasia, the customer service was practically non-existence. Could only get on live chat and was put on 98 in the queue!?!? Nothing would have been resolved if I had booked directly with AirAsia. NEVER book AirAsia! And trust Skypicker to make your holiday a fuss free one! Thumbs up Danial! Keep up the good work!
5	Thanks from Erika B. for answer all the question that i ask.Though my English is not that good,and type slowly,but also got a polite responses.Thank You again!!
5	The website made it easy to book multiple flights for one journey, and kept the price as low as possible. They checked-in for the flights on my behalf and sent over the boarding passes by email! My only problem is that I couldn't use an e-ticket using the wallet app on my iPhone, even though I've been able to do that for all my other flights! Otherwise it's a perfect service! The instant chat on the website is fast, easy and the people are super polite! Thanks!
5	On the minute help and precise help to check in with my details over chat. Very nice!
5	I want to say thanks for @Youssef  for helping , because we had exam and we could not be late , he called my  father to explain everything and he cared too much .so, he solved the problem so fast ��
5	Had some troubles with my flight (strike at my airport). They are helping me fastly to find a solution. I recommand this website!
5	We lost to book the ticket. But Skypicker is the nice services with very well supports from the these team.Thank you so much for your great supports!All the best!Greetings,Lany,
5	It is a pleasure for me to recommend Sabina- such a friendly, supportive and helpful person, that made me remember Kiwi as a truly great company that cares about their customers. I had some big troubles with Cebu Airlines and I could really see that she was doing EVERYTHING to help me. I even had a feeling she was checking the updates of my case after her working times :) It was a pleasure to have her as a person responsible for my case and I can really wish everyone to have contact with her.  Thank you so much for the heart you're putting in your work, it's really appreciated. I wish you all the best,Anna
5	Hi customer care team,Thanks a ton for your kindness attitude in resolving refund related issue; related to unfortunate events in Brussels. I'm sure with this kind of customer service , your company is making life long relationship with customers like me.Best Regards,Vikram
4	We had a great experiance booking with <http://Qiwi.com|Qiwi.com> and the transaction was hassle free :)
5	Everything worked alright, no problems occured, tickets arrived in time
3	The tennis season is about to start with the #AusOpen, book your last minute flights here: <https://t.co/KdfcJPeZJl><https://t.co/NoJqYOnH4h>
5	Good Job! I paid it fast and easy.. Nice customer service
4	Had some problems with the luggage which seemed to be included in the price of the tickets I bought, but at the check-in counter it turned out that its not, so I had to pay for my luggage separately at both flights.Nevertheless Ive sent the letter to the company using their online contact form and got response immediately and cash back within few days. Very pleased that we sorted this misunderstanding quickly and in a mutually convenient way. Thx Skypicker but please do smth about this luggage thing:) cheers:)
5	"I found the cheapest return ticket from London to Stockholm (3 day-trip) on Skypicker webpage. I booked it immediately and since that time they kept me updated about my journey details. In the last minute I had to contact them by phone because I forgot to provide my travel documents number - and they were as helpful as possible. The journey was perfect, I did not even had to think about the ""online check in"" because they did it instead of me, as well. I'll definitely travel by this company again and again!"
1	"Will NEVER use this company again!! my first flight with easyjet was delayed on March 3rd by 2 hours. Because of that my next flight to another country would be effected and they were going to find an alternative. I call them at 730 in the morning about this and as I am about to board the plane after all other passengers boarded at 1150 I receive an email as they said they couldn't reach me via phone. The alternative they offered me was to stay overnight in Switzerland and next day would fly to Portugal. I found this very distracting as they had booked me a flight and gave me 2 minutes to decide whether I'd stay overnight or not. I decided not to go on the plane as this would really distract my plans in Portugal. I call them again as I'm at the airport and they wouldn't find another alternative  that did not have a layover over night so I leave the airport. As I managed to move my plans and important meetings in Portugal, They email back about other alternatives for the next day. I accept one leaving March 4th to London at 1525 with the promise they'd delay my flight home by one day. As I'm at the airport about to check in, they call me and tellme that flight at 1525 is not available. At this point I'm very frustrated with the service and ask for a refund. They call me twice after that offering me overnight alternatives but refuse to delay my flight home  which was scheduled on March 7th. It was not possible to delay it till the 8th or 9th because that flight had not been ""effected already"". So basically in the end they offer me to get to Portugal on Sunday March 6th. My return flight was on Monday 7th at 6am. I was basically offered to stay a day in my planned destination  then go back home less than 12 hours later. Very very very disappointed with their service as they had promised other and when communicating with them weeks before flight the service was good. This has ruined a planned weekend that was scheduled months ahead and will work against me and my work for several weeks. I work in the travel industry and will definitely take skypicker off possible choices to offer to my clients."
5	In addition to having great prices for flights, the 24-hour customer service line was incredibly helpful.  I needed to change my flights due to an issue with my passport, and the travel consultants, specifically Anh Tran, made sure that I received the best new prices for my flights due to the last-minute problem.  Anh found a flight that fit with my schedule and helped me through this truly stressful time.  I received prompt answers to my many questions as well.  I highly recommend this service and I am grateful for all of the help I received!
5	Good feedback from Martin Carter.  I had to make 3 separate booking for a multi city trip and had not received confirmations.  He called me back twice to ensure everything was OK
4	I had an issue with my credit card verification due to muscomminication due to which I had to pay cash at the terminal. My refund had been stuck for 3 weeks with emails going back and forth between myself and kiwi. Callled up and talked to Natalia and she listened to what the problem was, did  her research, chased up the airlines and organized my refund all within an hour. Absolutely brilliant job. Thank you very much for doing your job so well. Regards Harry
5	After looking endlessly for the perfect combination of flights between European cities (last minute booking, too), it was only through <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> that I found an excellent deal, and to a very affordable price..  Their website is easy to navigate, and provided all the info I needed.   Shortly after booking the flights for me and a 2nd passenger (tickets and boarding passes were already been generated), I realized I had entered a name wrongly and had to ask for online assistance.  The Live Chat was a great way to connect with Kiwi to communicate the problem, and their operator, Dorota, was super nice, efficient, and very helpful!!   Big thanks to Dorota, and Monika K for promptly calling the airlines and resolving my last minute problem!:)
5	I booked Skypicker for my trip from LA to Rome -- it offered by far the cheapest fare of everywhere I looked. I haven't taken the trip yet but already the service has been top knotch. I contacted them a few days before my flight with concerns about the way I spelled my name on the boarding pass (it wasn't identical to my passport) and within a day they were able to get the name changed (for free!) with both airlines I'm flying and reissued me my boarding pass. Their customer service chatting tool has been available 24/7 and you actually are connected to a real person when it happens. I'll let you know how the flight itself goes!
4	price was ok, and boarding passes were sent
5	I was not sure if my flight included a meal or how to request one. Filip was very helpful in directing me to the right area to manage my booking and instructing me how the process worked for me to know the additional cost of adding a meal.
5	Thanks Ondra for helping me with my booking  - Very helpful and knowledgeable
5	The service is really friendly and nice, also for the little things about bureaucracy. Eszter B. was very kind.
5	@askairasia Hello. We've booked a flight via <https://t.co/lKncAOWKdy> and want to ensure, that everything is ok with our booking.
3	@skypickercom dear skypicker I've booking my ticket from belgrade to KL at 16 feb, can I change it to 16 march? <https://t.co/ffjvRLFTRM>
5	I was really positive surprised with Skypicker service. I had travel from Warsaw to Copengagen and i was completely satisfied. Less then in 5 minutes after Visa payment i received my e-tickets. Next time i'll travel for sure with Skypicker!
5	I've used <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> a couple of times now and it's been the smoothest experience I've ever had with any company. Every issue I've had, has been sorted out within minutes.
5	Kojo went out of his way to reschedule a flight after the death of a child in the family. I cant thank you enough, It has been such an upsetting day as Mr L's grandchild aged just 4 years old died earlier today after a short illness. Mr L can now grieve with his family. Kojo, Thank you so so much. today has been such a sad day full of tears of sadness but you went out of your way to help us.
5	Just had a query regarding my flights, used the online chat service and Julia was excellent! Efficient, friendly and knowledgeable, thank you!
5	Great and very quick customer service thanks to their live chat and Polina M especially
5	Kiwi. com is very nice and user friendly website allowing you to neatly arrange your flights. Nevertheless I needed to turn to on-line support and Filip was my agent.  Filip was very nice and friendly, and even switched to Czech Language upon seeing that my e-mail adrress is endin in .cz. Very nice gesture everyone would appreciate. I would definitelly recommend <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> to anyone. It is very simple  website and the support is very helpful.
5	after finding the best flight for me, i had to wait for my passport to get and thus to enter my passport number. everything was processing carefully about it and customer service was really helpful.
5	I encountered a great experience with any and all details of my booking. I spent hours searching for information from other sites with no success.  Kiwi resolved and assisted me with unending patience in such a short time.  Thanks for the awesome experience.
5	Booked and downloaded my tickets and boarding passes through Skypicker. Realised 24 hours before departure that had booked in my married name, but my passport was in my maiden name. Contacted Skypickers via email, and they reissued my tickets and boarding passes in time. My contact there was so friendly and helpful, quickly responding to all my anxious emails. It was a welcome personal touch, rather than an unconvincing automated response. Most importantly, everything my contact said she was going to do, she did, in the specified time! This kind of service seems to be quite rare these days.
5	Great people to do business with. Helped me a lot on my booking mistakes.
5	good flight deals, easy to pay with different payment system and do the check in for you. Reminder Emails and everything fast done.I needed to contact the live-chat, fast response and the service from Samael was excalant.Absolutely thumbs up.Small point, whiles you do the check in maybe asking for seating preferences.
5	Using Kiwi was great and easy for my trip to Paris from LAX.  I had a layover in Copenhagen going to Paris, and a layover in Oslo flying back to LAX.  The prices were the best I saw on the market.  Be forewarned about some airlines that you need to pay extra to check baggage, I knew about this going in, and thus knew the advertise price wasn't the true cost of flying price.  But still <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> has the most competitive deals out there for transcontinental flights.
5	Wonderful service that finds indeed amazing routes to get me to the destination. I rather say it becomes an adventure when booking with kiwi. I also strongly suggest to avoid checking in any luggage as it requires much more effort and time between the flights especially if it's a short connection.
4	Appreciation in speed of management.Select good flight good time.I will be client of <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> again.
3	Skypicker offers flights for up to 90 percent less with a cloud-based ticketing portal: In 2012, Skypicker fou... <https://t.co/jcHhagyXnk>
5	i wanna thank to skypicker for  helping me to change the name of my ticket just so quick. I really appreciate all of you guys....
5	Tamara helped me quickly when I messed up the passport details
5	Had a problem with the flight confirmation not coming through to my email, got in contact on their website through customer support and within an hour they got back to me by phone to make sure I had received the confirmation email they had resent! Salom, the man who was talking to me, was extremely helpful, and even gave me further information on how to manage my booking and make sure everything was sorted for my flight! very impressed by the speed and quality of service. Thanks Salom!

5	Switch up in my flight and both Martin Carter & Martin Pospisil have been efficient, fast, and very courteous. Couldn't ask for more from customer service!
4	I just spoke with Miroslava P with a few of my worries regarding our flights tomorrow since this is our first time booking with Kiwi and she was extremely helpful. She answered all of my questions thoroughly and helped put my mind at ease. I can only hope that the actual flights go as easy!
1	Thought you have found a brilliant deal from <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> when you did your research for unusual combination of flights on a comparison website? Well, THINK AGAIN!!! I have just learned a hard lesson by being (very) careless in clicking the ‘Pay Now’ button when booking with them and want others to learn from my carelessness.<http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> was previously known as Skypicker (which has been ‘infamous’ all over the internet and Reddit), set up in 2012 but has to change its name to <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> in just 4 years – that should be the first warning sign to travellers, but I didn’t bother to do so much research before booking our flights in a hurry and again, carelessly (my own fault!).Their website is slick and very pleasant and this company does what others seldom do, ie. to combine flights from airlines that do not normally collaborate into a single itinerary. During our search for such flights on <http://Kayak.com|Kayak.com>, the search results came out with <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> offering the cheapest rate for the combination of 2 flights which we wanted. So, we clicked on them and were taken to their website, where we had to fill up a whole lot of personal details etc. until we came to the part where it says: ‘Add Baggage’. Of course, we clicked on that and a whopping sum of £80 per person, meaning a another total sum of £160 was added to our final payment for the 4 legs of short flights which we booked. In a haste, I did not notice this, thinking that all booking companies will be honest in this respect and just charge what the airlines companies actually charge, but I WAS WRONG!! After hitting the ‘Pay’ button and finally got the Invoice and Confirmation from <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>, I realised the exorbitant charges and went on the websites of both the airlines companies itself to see how much I will have to pay if I book with them directly, WITH baggage – and WOW!!!! The price was actually £160 less than what <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> has charged me. The cheaper price of the airlines companies even includes seat reservations, which <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> did not give me.Immediately after realising my mistake (less than 1 hour after booking), I called the UK number listed on their website to try to cancel my booking, because I know that both the airline companies I booked with offer full refund if cancelled within 24 hours (what they call their grace period). Even if they don’t ,the bulk of the over-charging on my tickets are not by the airline companies, but by <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> on the so-called ‘Baggage Charge’. The UK phone number that I called didn’t even produce a ringing tome. So, I went to their online chatline and started a chat with their customer service people, who were very trained to avoid directly answering my questions and promised to call the airlines companies to see how much refund they can get from the airlines companies for me. Remember – this was just exactly 1 hour after I have placed my booking. And they told me that they will need 2 hours to give me an answer. 2 hours came and passed. No answer. I had to send another chat to them before they finally emailed me a reply 30 minutes after the promised time.And of course, the reply was laughable – that the airlines companies will only refund €43 from the £393 that I have paid to <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> ….AND as if that wasn’t insulting enough, <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> has the cheek to tell me that out of this €43, THEY will take another €20 from me as their ‘handling fees’ for my cancellation. So, I didn’t cancel the flights because I will lose more money than I have already lost by contributing to the profit margin of <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>. No doubt this company will not lay quiet with my review here – from what I see, they were very good at responding to all the glowing 5-star reviews from their “1-review” reviewers on this site. A look at the reviews left on their Facebook Page will tell a different story altogether. Pity I didn’t check that before I booked with them.They will now say that it was my fault for clicking the ‘Pay Now’ button even after seeing the exorbitant charges they have added to my booking. Yes, I admit that this was true, but still it did not erase the fact that <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> was adding exorbitant charges to the supposedly ‘cheap’ base fares and some unsuspecting customers like myself will fall victim to this. Therefore, BEWARE!!
5	The check-in was made on time and the tickets sent to my email as expected :)
5	I had the pleasure of talking with Valentin on the Kiwi chat. I had a unforseen reason to adjust my travel plans and was happily surprised with the ease they were able to help me. I was expecting a negative response, or a no you cannot change anything, but instead was relieved at how flexible and willing to help they were. I was hesitant about using Kiwi but now I definitely will for future travel!
5	All has gone without a hitch. Anna was also very helpful today, sending links to the relevant parts of the website to input API.
5	Filip was fast and efficient in helping my brother get a flight to LAX he was very quick and got the job done. Highly recommend him to give great service.
5	La agente Aura me trato muy bien y resolvio mis problemas. Muy recomendable.The Aura agent treated me very well and resolved my problems. Highly recommended .
1	BAD EXPERIENCE!!!!! I am having a terrible experience with Kiwi as well!! I booked my flight on 8.09 and I still don't have the money back (more than 10 working days). Customer service is not efficient...
1	I booked flights for myself and 3 other passengers from Singapore to Maumere, Indonesia, on 5 August 2016 through <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>, using it for the first time. I then booked all my other flights to finally return to Singapore on 11 August 2016.Imagine my shock when my friend said the itinerary was wrong and I checked all my itinerary information and realised that Kiwi had booked our flight to Maumere, Indonesia, on 8 August 2016 instead of our intended date of 5 August 2016, costing us a total of $1,322 SGD!!!! Now our plans are ruined and we are pretty much screwed because of <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>.We called <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> to change the flight and they were completely unhelpful, denying us a refund and asking us firstly to book the flight again on their site through changing the booking to 5 August 2016 (which would cost us over $1,000 SGD!!) Of course we were unhappy with this, so we called them AGAIN and they said they would call us within 3 hours with a resolution. Instead of a call they only sent an email saying that their system showed that we had booked the flight on 8 August 2016. Of course they would send something like that and deny that we had booked our flight on 5 August 2016, now we are screwed costing us $1,322 SGD with a messed up travel itinerary!!!!!We have no way to get our money back now with Kiwi being completely unhelpful and refusing to offer a refund or change our flight to the originally intended date of the 5th August despite this being their system error!!! We are completely dissatisfied and unhappy with the system error and customer service, which has completely ruined our vacation plans!!!We are now thinking of just giving up all the flights we have booked for this trip, which has cost us a total of $2,800 SGD, and not go on vacation at all. Our vacation plans are ruined.
5	Live chat available at midnight, which in and of itself is commendable. Helped by Archie who found answers for all of my very specific questions as soon as possible. Cheers for making my travels that much easier!
5	I got correct and detailed personal information.
3	Be careful with @skypickercom They divide flight tickets even in transit points. Means you have checkin again in every stop and get a visa
5	I've made my fair of mistakes on Kiwi in regards to booking errors, inputting wrong information, etc. However, every time I chat with a Kiwi representative, they're always so great, polite and helpful. I spoke with Lucie F. earlier tonight and she assisted me in correcting my mistake and I'm ever so grateful!! Kiwi provides great affordable prices but do be careful with things like transferring your luggage between layover spots, etc.

2	Poor choice of flights that ended up by having not enough time to catch a connecting flightTwo airlines Emirates+Air Asia chose by Skypicker for my journey - do not cooperate together that is also why my luggage did not go all the way to my final destination and I had to collect it in transit which took me an hour followed by catching a train to a different terminal and at the end Emirates rejected to help me out saying they are not in fault.Before I got to the Air Asia check-in counter, no one was there and gate was also already closed.At that stage I rang up Skypicker helpline. To my surprise our communication went very well and after a couple of calls they put me on another flight but I had to spend a night at the airport waiting 8 hours for my flight.To sum up, I arrived at my final destination with 9 hours delay. No meals,refreshments,phone calls or hotel provided.Also my luggage did not make it on time but arrived a day later and I missed important day at work.
4	I had some questions for my upcoming trip and the girl in support( Aliaksandra) was very kind and responded everything i wanted to know! very kind and positive. so far so good :) will put 5 stars after my trip if everything else goes smooth. good job on the on line chat support thingie! :)
1	Just Booked Today 3 Domestic Flights in Colombia with them......The Carrier is VivaColombia......I paid for the 3 Flights including 1 Extra Piece of Luggage  207€....The same Flights including the Luggage on the Webpage of VivaColombia......Only 126€.......Hmmmm.......Guys....This is not NICE !!!!
5	The live chat on Kiwi's website was great. Chat operator Michal was super helpful and a clear communicator. Thank you Kiwi!
5	Tomáš Mužík was really good as a attendent. Help me with all i needeed and in a very fast way. I couldn't be happierI certain will recomend <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com>

5	Very helpful UK customer service. I booked multi city trip and had to change one of the flights, the travel agent Jonathan Ronald Muller Eghan who answered my phone immediately found a more suitable flight for me. Thanks for your help.
5	I just had an instant message conversation with David to be sure that they have received all the necessary information to proced with our online check in and he was very polite and helpfull.Thanks David!
5	I'm floored but this company's customer service! They are prompt, attentive and very helpful. They answer all my questions and helped me change my flights twice with no hesitation or problems. Ajit on of the agents was particularly very helpful and nice. I truly appreciate it his help and knowledge.
5	Thank You for the great customer service via chat, Alex A.!
5	Really fast and promp customer service!
5	I am extremely pleased with Kiwi's customer service. I used the chat system and got an answer very quickly. The agent's name was Filip, he was polite and fast and was able to help me immediately. His response came a few minutes and was very effective.
5	Thanks Eugene for being super fast in responding to my query. It was really helpful. Keep up the good work :)
5	Tomas J helped me very fast to get me my fight itinerary. He was to the point, professional and polite. Just the way I think things should be!
2	Good morning!So initially my experience with skypicker was good! I got my tickets I was rearing to go, so keen to start my holiday to Cartagena. My original flights went like this (bit of a pain but it was the most reasonably priced option):Gatwick - Oslo - Fort Lauderdale - CartagenaSo I arrived at Gatwick and checked in, only to find my flight had been delayed, so I would need to sit in the airport for another 10 hours. This was no one's fault - we had a big storm - but unfortunately would mean that I was going to miss my connection to FLL. I rang up skypicker to get this rearranged and they were perfectly helpful, despite my dismay, promising to look into alternative flights. Eventually I got a new connection to fort Lauderdale from oslo. This was shortly before my flight left (about 8/9 hours later) but at least I knew what to do on arrival in Oslo. The hotel was sorted (covered by the airline) and although it was adding an extra day to my trip at least i was all in one piece.This is where it starts to get ridiculous.I arrived in oslo to sort out the hotel and get confirmation of my flights, where I am informed that the new flights that have been booked for me require a change at GATWICK. (you know, the place i waited at for 10 hours in order try and make some progress on my journey). The fact that this connection was arranged while i was still in Gatwick airport and no alarm bells rung in the operators mind is beyond me. I had just been left to wait in Gatwick for 10 hours only to be sent back the very next day. I am not sure if the operator has ever had to wait in an airport, but it is not an exciing place to wait, and if you want to do anything more than watch the clock tick past slowly requires some money for a new book/wifi and more than €10 for food.Why was i not informed that the connection that was being booked was via my home airport? Fair enough if there are no planes Oslo-FLL the next day, but if there is one from the airport I am sitting in with the correct airline then why send me to Norway and back, wasting resources, money and a hell of a lot of time?On the surface friendly and helpful, if slow. In reality pretty useless. Will not be using again (unless flights are hundreds of pounds cheaper and i have all the time in the world).
5	Jan lukasek Helped me tremendously during the live chat.  Overall my experience thus far has been great I hope it continues!  Thanks kiwi let's do this.
5	Agent was polite and helpful
5	Nice to have online chat support 24/7. Thanks Mario for helping me with the additional baggage.

5	On these holiday times anything can happen, and as Murphy's law predicts, it had to happen to us. My wife was having some issues with her baggage to the point she was about to loose her flight or had to pay everything all over again...and even though we were trying to solve this since the day before, the system of the airline was overloaded. Nevertheless,  Viktor P., went the extra mile (extra light year I will say) and help us in such a candid and articulate way that inspire me to write a review!  He did everything he could to help from his side, kept me calm and show a level of professionalism I hardly find in any other company. Kiwi 5 Stars! Viktor... You get 10! Merry Xmas!!
4	Ms. Tanya O was very courteous and follow through in assisting me to look up ticket pricing since the website and the App I was using was having some technical recurring issue to look up different dates and countries.She was patient and shows humanity in her dealings with me.I only hope that others I. The company will imitate her professionalism and qualities.Olami. A

5	HeyI had a problem buying the ticket and I was helped by one of your employees online support named Victor S.Thank you!Petrica
1	"I have made a booking for 9 of january 2016 and after I added all the information I accidentally hit ""enter"" and there it was all the information seemed to e confirmed in the right way except the date. I realized right after before receiving their confirmation mail, I even have the proof of the time and phone number of when I call the company and they told me that I can only change the date for an extra fee. This is really uncomfortable for the customer since it was an error and I called right away to solve the issue, but they told me that everything is registered, that is not true, I used to work in this industry an it takes some time until the data is tranfered. So of course if they wanted to deliver a good service they would have collaborated and cancel my few second error reservation and proceed  with the right one. This non refund policy seems illegal especially for a company that tends to offer ""good service"". It is like I am ordering something online and the seconds after I am forced to buy it or change it with something else for the same value.... that is insane. Maybe this is the only way they can earn some money, and of course the customer does not counts anymore once they got the money. There is no service, of curse it may be if you want to change and give them more money. This is really the most disappointing experience that I have ever got with a flight intermediary. If you want to know what good service is , is to be customer oriented first of all , and here I am not saying that you have to do what the customer says, but be more flexible and don't take every rule for granted. I mean , when I called seconds after I realized that something is wrong... I tend to believe that this change was made by your website ""accidentally"". Thank you for a bad service!Just so everyone knows, the only help they gave me is ""sorry"" or of course get more money from me by changing the dates....which is absolutely incredibly unprofessional, why would I pay more to change the dates and pay more since I could pay again for the exact date. There is no flexibility, no nothing , be careful everything they say seems to be carved in stone, they won't change their decision because of course , why wouldn't they use some easy money?  Their rules are made so that the customer can get the least service from them and flexibility. Hopefully I will make sure that none of my friends nor people that I know buy anything through them. Thanks for your ""sorry"", it really showed me how much you are trying to help a customer."
5	My call has been manged by Puput (Indonesian name) and it has been really helpful: not only because at the end the boarding cards were in my inbox, but also for the kindness.Thank you!
5	I needed to sort out an issue with my booking and it was 1 am in the morning and discovering that <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> offers 24/7 online help desk was very convenient. I chatted with Tomas, who was able to help me sort my issue out within a few minutes. I am really happy with the service!
5	Aloha!Mr. Radim.K was very kind, because he listened to my stupid question about the luggage. Thanks for good service!!!!
4	Booked a ticket on Malindo Air for $18!!!  Amazing price. One problem,the ticket said the baggage allowance was 15kg. I checked    by calling Skpicker in London and Nina was great -- when it was taking time to get the correct baggage allowance she offered to call me back, and did about an hour later. (Baggage allowance is actually 30kg).  While Nina did her support job really well, it shouldn't really have been necessary -- Skypicker needs to do what is necessary to give accurate baggage limits right.
2	A startup that finds 'hidden' discount flight tickets just launched in the US <https://t.co/VHUP0cmrUM> via @sai
1	We bought 2 seats full price but made a mistake on the passenger year of birth making it appears like an infant.  However we paid for two adults tickets we should be given two seats.  No problem on the ongoing flight.  On the return flight, Skypicker paid the airline for one seat, so the airline would not let us both check-in.  We missed our flight since there was no other seat available.  Asking skypicker to buy the second seat, the one they owed us, for a later  flight, they never accepted and neither wanted to reimburse.
4	We made a reservation through skypicker and we had a problem with the date of the flight. We send them a mail during weekend and they answered us very quick. We had to make a change and after few emails they helped us and did the change with no fee.We didn't have any problems with the check in at the airport.
4	thanks for all your help Olga and Michaela
5	Great and fast service via chat. Added last-minute luggage to flight and it was quick and easy. The support agent Emre T. was very friendly and helpful and confirmed every step with me to make sure we got it right. Awesome!
1	No words this company should shut down ... Still confused whats wrong with this company woww never make the same mistake
5	Valy has been prompt and patient in handling my queries. It got resolved within minutes. keep this going :)
5	Really like the rescheduling options you provide whenever there are flight changes. Also the service is really prompt and quick.
5	I needed to add my passport information to my booking. When I couldn't find where to add the info, Yuliya came to the rescue, as well as helping me with other questions that came up. Will definitely use Skypicker again.

5	Pavel Fridrich was great! Helped me when I was in a pickle!!!
3	I had to travel from ksa to italy, doing two transit in turkey ( the first one in adana and the second one in istanbul).A part from the quite long time of waiting during the transit, the timetable given by skypicker had been respected.The price was really convenient, but i had to pay an addiotional tax due to visa in turkey (even if i had only transit, because in yhe airport of adana there is not transit area).The crew of pegasus wasn't kind at all, and even if i have residence permit in Italy the made me some problem at the time of check in.If i had to rate this experience from 1 to 5 i would give it 3 stars.Hope this will be helpful fore someone.
5	Thanks to IRA V for all the help. Excellent service and prompt reply.
5	good service and quick response  thanks again ,Youssef
4	The feedback you get from their support is fantastic. Under two occasions I got help with all I needed and more from two differant people.
4	Very hands on and helpful assistant (Julia) to suggest and solve any kind of issues.
5	Eric Ropars, excellent customer service, all round nice guy, quick to solve my queries! thanks,
5	I needed help with my reservation, and Catalina L, helped me out and was very nice on the live chat. She answered very very fast as well!thanks for the help
5	I wanted to check in online for my flight but did not know how and I contacted the <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> service by chat.

5	i got proper information easily, thanks
5	Great experience in booking my flight. I would like to say special thanks to Daniela, for her assistance during my booking.
5	I spoke specifically to Petra, an agent used to provide customers with assistance.  Rather than trying to have me cough up $80 to change a flight, Petra guided me to finding the most inexpensive option. Petra told me the ups and downs of picking the cheaper flights and searched for cheap flights for me as well as contacted the airlines directly to give me my best options.
4	Efficient and polite, always a very quick response 24 hours of the day, dealt with my partial refund issue, in a matter of a few hours the money was credited back into my account would not hesitate to use skypicker again for travel arrangements. Excellent service
5	Good at finding cheap flights with good hours
5	Éric helped me to change my baguage registration quickly As i needed. Thanks a lot for that I saved money and now no worries I can get my flight without to pay an extra at the airport so it's perfect.
5	Tomas Krivanek was really helpful when I had some last minute questions. Thank you Tomas!
1	"EXTREMELY PISS POOR SERVICE! Please do not take my comments lightly. If you decide to use their services, expect below standard customer satisfaction. We were emailed @ 4am due to a flight change. Our initial flight was bound to take off @ 13hr. So due to their ""prompt"" service of flight change notification, we were emailed @ 4am to catch a 7 am flight the same day. Which forced us to forfeit our spa treatment, break and nanny service.  We asked for reimbursement but they kindly rejected."
5	Hi Team,This was the first time, I was booking on <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> and I forgot to add check in baggage in my reservation. I initiated a chat with Viktor and he told me about the 48 hour rule and however, he got the baggage added well within less than 24 hours.You have been an absolute help and brilliant in handling my case in the last moment.You deserve an accolade. God Bless and you have a great year ahead..
5	Awesome fast and efficient customer service. !!!!
1	"Worst travel website I've used. I paid for a flight which they cancelled on me claiming it got ""canceled by the airline""... Turns out it was not canceled but the price had increased. Yet they claim they have a strict non-refund policy when you purchase a ticket, but they won't own up to their mistake and honour their prices."
1	Awful service, prices aren't better than just going through the airlines' site (RyanAir etc). Their email correspondence went to my spam folder on the email because of the quality of this service. Costumer service was rigid, and completely inept. Avoid at all costs.
5	The day before my flight I realized that I totally forgot to enter the necessary information into Manage my booking section for me to get my boarding pass in time ... The possibility of entering this manually was not available anymore... So I asked for help and Serhiy was sooo nice !! He did the online check-in for me and I got my boarding pass right away !!That saved me some money, because I already thought I was going to pay the check-in-at-the-airport fee ....so BIG thanks to Serhiy !!!!!!!! he saved me!
4	Just wanna say thanks to Klara for a quick helpful hand on upgrading my cheked baggage limit. We discussed over the live chat system. It took slightly 10min while I had to wait the whole week to get the same work done via emailing.
3	Incompetent asshats running customer service almost made me miss my flightbut the flight was inexpensive so...3/5
1	I booked 2 very expensive economy tickets on Virgin air and they did not send me the e-ticket. I called them and they said there were some technical faults and would call me back in 2 hours. They didnt and as it was an emergency (flying at 21.55 that evening) I called back. This was at 11.30am - To cut it short they messed me about all day and subsequently called me at 5pm to say they could not deliver on their promised tickets! I could not attend a funeral because of them. Do NOT book with them
1	"Booked 2 connecting flights in one transaction on the same airline as I did not have 6 months left on my passport and would not be able to pass through immigration. Not only did they process it as 2 separate bookings, nowhere did they say that checkout would be required. Now the flights are totally useless and I am unable to get a refund. Service was also shocking, they had no idea what they were talking about, and the ""solutions"" they presented me with, would also have been unusable flights and wasted even more of my money if I had listened to them."
5	I have received prompt and correct assistance from Tatev Grigorian. Thank you!
5	Thank you so much spypicker and Julia Shestopalova for helping me with my booking ! You are the best
2	I rang you 2 minutes after  this date era on  61 261452805 at about 19.30 on the 31st Oct. ( get back to you in an hour or two. You didn’t, I rang again and the next day quite a few times you have the records) you got back to me with a new ticket At full price so I sent the message to Nokair see their response. Apparently for a few hundred THB we had 24 hours to change the date.SENT TO NOKAIR I booked 3 flights from Hanoi to Phuket  on the 31 October and the search engine had change the date to the 2 April 2017 I was after the 19th of March. When I noticed the mistake 2 minutes later I rang <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> and they thought they could fix it . They did not so I have booked a new flight from Hanoi to Phuket and noticed you are sold out on the 2 April 2017 now, could I get a refund at all. flight:Nok Air Flight 3203 Confirmation no.

5	It was a great experience booking thru SkyPicker.My name is somewhat unique (too late to blame my parents) as it includes a symbol - not all alphabet. Perhaps my parents though wanted to code it to make sure there's no copy anywhere. lolThis became a problem as their booking system doesn't recognize it, and with an increasing security measures in airports for most countries, I wanted to make sure that they can help me in my booking concern.I would like to make personal mention to Ms.Erika Belaskova for her effort to helping my name to be resolved in their system. She even went extra mile to inform the respective airline companies so that I don't have to do nor worry about it myself.More power to you and the rest of your team who have helped in other ways. I do wish that you will continue doing with same good ENERGY and PASSION to your services.P-Dionell
4	Awesome service from @babak. Fly from sydney to jakarta was so easy to arrange it.
5	I strongly recommend Skypicker to anyone too busy or too bored to book airplane tickets. you just tell them when and where you want to go and they do all the work for you. They respond to e-mails and requests right away, they're friendly and have all the answers.Great customer service, quick and easy processes, great experience!
4	Thanks Tomáš Mužík for your rapid and effective response. I realised that I'd not received boarding passes for my flights and whilst it was an inconvenience to have to chase them up, Tomáš dealt with the situation in a matter of minutes.Much appreciated.James
5	Very Satisfied and Quick Response
5	Everything in one place, comfortable UI, no prices change or delays, accurate flight times, no complains.
5	I have had a great experience with Kiwi so far. It was easy to book inexpensive, international flights even with departure and arrival locations different on both sides. Also, Thomas Knox was extremely helpful when we needed to change our return flight due to some unsafe political issues in the country for one of our layovers. He listened to our concerns and got us a flight home that we were more comfortable with. We and our friends and family are ever so grateful Thomas Knox!
5	The service was absolutely amazing! I sent an email with a request a couple of minutes after my booking and got a reply within no time. Ms Marie Fiserova made a huge effort supporting me, sending updates and very detailed, friendly and helpful emails to me. I am very pleased with her service and can happily recommend booking with skypicker! :)
5	I just got help from the customers support, Zdenka B. was the one to help a wired guy like me, and he fast a swiftly got to my problem and even aske away to find more if there was any, i hope the flight will be just half as enjoyable as the service.So a big thank you to Zdenka B. and i hope he gets a good lunch or something nice, he derseves it.Will all good will and hugsAlexander Andersen
4	I accidentaly forgot to fill in passport number but excellent Lukas P from support saved my day at Sunday's evening. Thanks a lot!Unfortunately, I couldn't get email from, kiwi but I downloaded my boarding pass from my account.
1	I had booked a return flight from LGK - SIN with a flight time of 17.45 but after payment the itenary shows 12.40 departure flight. No concessions or any sort of adjustments were provided. Moreover I was told that it was a mistake from my end from the customer support after checking their systems.On changing of flight payment page did not appear directly, instead it shows on unpaid changes and when you proceed there it shows a different amount plus there are no itenary details on the payment page. Very combursome, user unfriendly and I have to pay extra for the same flight which I need to book with no adjustments whatsoever even after chatting with the customer care executives for more than 3 hours
5	I just want to compliment agent Henry that I have been dealing with on live chat.He has reassured me & could not do enough for me.Many thanks & I would recommend to others.
5	Had a query about my flight and I was promptly put into contact with Katka, they were extremely friendly and willing to help with solving my problem(required extra baggage past the cut off time) and they made sure it was all sorted out.I'd recommend them to anyone who asked.
5	Requested flight change from Kiev to Odessa, but no direct flights were found, so guys from Kiwi sent me tips with GPS locations where to enjoy Kiev in weather like this :sunny:special thanks to Jolana and Vladimir!
5	Kiwi are a fantastic company that I have used multiple times and will use again in the future. The help chat is awesome and is brilliant for getting things fixed or updated. Miroslava P was very helpful and was very quick at updated my booking for me. Fantastic company!
5	I had to fill in my travel document ID.Eric Ropars was very patient and helpful and assisted me in producing all I needed for my  travel.One minor thing to check is the waiting time until Eric got connected. Many people are calling from long distance so kiwi should consider how to reduce waiting time to avoid roaming costs for costumers.
1	I recently booked a trip with Skypicker and they have allocated me and my partner different seats on all 6 legs of my flights, I have never has this happen before, even when flying Air Asia, and now I've found out, and it's too late to change they want me to pay extra to correct the mistake their computer booking system made.
5	very good chat service..... talked to Yulia K. , within a very short time my question was resolved
5	Very quick replies to any enquiry at any time. Very efficient.
5	I needed support and help in a very tight schedule The team who helped meFilip Klega And Viktor PolasekWhere excellent and solved my problems quickly and efficiently I will continue to use Kiwi on a regular basisThanks againMark Smulian
5	after having made a error on typing the passport ID and asked for help in the chat,Juan Costa was prompt and very accurate on fixing all the ID details for me and my family passengers, and double checking all eventual problems. everything was fixed. Also answer me to some others questions I had. Very helpful. I really felt that I was being taken care. Thank you.
5	<http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> has really great call service / help center. I had several questions about my flight tickets and all of them was immediately and exactly answered. I spoke by phone with Kiwi Travel Consultant Barbara Kubešová.
5	absolutely lovely!!! amazing service on 24\7! natalia is been really helpful and patience . she told me all i need to know and is always a pleasure booking through this safe website! amazed thank you
3	The search engine that Skypicker provides is flawless. However, I did not receive one of my boarding passes automatically and I had to reach their customer support. Even though their customer support was very helpful, I received my boarding ticket late which very complicated my situations since I had troubles to find a place to print out the boarding ticket.I do not know if it is the same for all airlines, but if you receive your boarding ticket less than 24 in advance and you are traveling with no access to printer, you may end up paying significant amount of money for printing the boarding ticket at the airport, since the ticket in you app/email cannot be used on you smartphone
5	I had a problem when I filled out the wrong information when making online Chack in . I helped with live chat and I got great help from a representative named Luis . He fixed the problem quickly and professionaly .Thank you Lewis, you did well!
5	I had a problem with my lugagge, I wanted to add another bag that online can not being added, then I asked to one of the people encharged in Kiwi per email and she could help me, her name is Claudia L. she was very kind and called me to resolve my problem I explained her and then she calls the airlineteam to ask them about my problem, it was very helpful, she could find the whole information that I needed, I wanna thank again to her. Than I had another Problem with the link and I call miss Veronika Martincova and she was also very nice and she help me with everything. I can say that the Kiwi team is eficient and quick to resolve problems or to respond questions.
5	Mario was very helpful and kind. He managed my questions perfectly and fast. From now on i'll recomend <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> for buying flight tickets, every company customer service is always awful and you have to wait too much, but here everything were fast, easy and fixed. thanks a lot.
5	I was very happy on phone with Mr Anas Dallal.You have correctly answered all my questions. I am reassured that my trip will indeed take place on the scheduled day.Thank you !
5	I missed a connection due to a delayed flight, and the airline didn't want to take responsibility, so I ended up contacting skypicker and they rebooked my flight without hesitation once I explained the issue.
5	Was confused with all the flight changes and connection flight procedures, but Mr Pedro was helpful and with great sense of humor to guide me through the process and help to figure things out :) great experience !

5	I got all my tickets on time.
5	SkyPicked provided fast and informative support during all our European trip. Helped us with all boarding passes on all our flights too. Very fast online support was a big plus. Will definitely use their service again. Thanks guys!
5	Martin Carter was very quick and courteous  when helping me change a flight departure location. Thank you!
3	So disappointed with your service, got denied at the check in counter via scoot from singapore to sydney as they want us to get australian visa even if we were just transiting from SYD TO AUCK.we were not informed by this. We ended up purchasing new tickets from sg to nz from different airlines! Will definitely not using and not recommending your service ever again!
5	Yuriy you are awesome.Helped me with some last min baggage issues due to the wife buying extra items. Sorted out the extra baggage swiftly and quick, no hassles no dramas at a low price. Will be booking flights with skypicker from now on if people like yuriy is on the team.Thanks yuriy!Regards,Dave
5	I was in contact with Eliska M. as well as Klara H. and they were very kind and helpful. I could not have asked for a better service!
4	Skypicker really simplifies the process of booking air tickets, especially if this involves multiple legs with different airlines. Usually the rates are lower than those offered directly at the airlines' websites, however sometimes for low-cost airlines you can get the same ticket combination cheaper. Overall, I was very satisfied with the process and additional services (adding baggage, insurance, etc.). One point of improvement is that for some of the airlines Skypicker cannot complete the online check in and you have check in at the airport at no extra cost, but waste time. This happens, even though the airline itself offers on line check in case you book directly with them.
5	I would like to thank Miss Kira for heir kindness she was very kind and helpful,
5	<http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> got me to Corfu via Manchester when Expedia and KLM failed and offered me useless alternatives. I booked via Kiwi and found it fast, easy and secure. Saved my holiday in the sun!
4	Super fast login chats and great service skills by the lovely Irina V. Got all of my questions answered in no time. I'm completely satisfied! Thanks again.
5	The agent Mr. Valli : understod my question very well in the first go and responded accurately. Agent had complete knowledge of the process and flights.Excellent !!!
5	Thanks to the team. They are doing their best to give help
5	Thank you so much to Alan for his wonderful personal approach and assistance during my dilemna of trying to book a last minute flight for my wife to fly back to Australia. He was more than helpful and very friendly to speak to. He took his time to explain everything when making the online booking and put my mind at ease (as well as my wife's). I would highly recommend <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> when booking a flight.
5	I thought I was in real trouble due to a luggage issue, but Ivana Vlahovic was very friendly and resolved it very quickly. It was a load of my mind and I am very grateful to her.
5	<http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> is an excellent and efficient way to book flights. They even send you boarding passes to print out and save time and money when it comes time to check in. I would certainly recommend them to anybody contemplating a flight. In fact I have already done so.
5	Thanks Catharina for helping me personally! You're the best :)
5	Is e very good company.
5	They had really good customer service. Thanks Petr!
5	Miroslav saved me at the brink of the hour!
5	I recently used skypicker to fly from Copenhagen to Malta via Milan with Ryan Airlines. Due to being busy I wasn't able to look at check-in until the day before and because it was Ryan Air I then had to pay 40euros to check-in, however my second connection was still able to check-in but I couldnt get it to work online. I called skypicker and talked with Mr. Henry Gharagyozyan who was extremly helpful. He understood I was upset and that I urgently needed to check-in for my connection flight. He had a lot of patience and managed to solve my problem by checking me in and sending a boarding pass, even gave me a nice seating.
5	It was brilliant. I solved my problem with wrong expiration date of my ID easily and fast. I'm more than satisfied with your support! and I love Kiwi.
5	I needed help entering my passport info/checking in and Alan was very helpful via the live chat and did it all for me online. Thanks Alan!!!!
5	Ms. Miroslava helped in order to check in my flight just a few hours before the flight. She was very helpful and her service was really fast:)
4	My flight out of Sapporo was cancelled due to weather, and for some reason the airline re-booked my ticket for 6 months later and refused to change it without a fee. Tomáš Mužík negotiated with the airline and was able to book me on a flight for the next day.  I am grateful for his help, and would recommend skypicker for booking flights on foreign low-cost airlines.
4	This was my first time with sky picker, but I will definatley purchase tickets through them again. The flights were the cheapest I could find, all of the transactions from buying the ticket all the way going brought airport check in went well.
5	Lenka was superb help for me, when i needed help with check in. Thank you. Have a wonderful Christmas
5	I spoke to Barbora and received an excellent feedback for all my doubts.Really good customer chat service.

1	My request for transit visa was refused by some reasons. Now i completely lost my money paid for ticket, 'cause skypicker doesn't have refund option.
5	Great search capabilities - allows you to find really great deals if you are willing to collect your bag and recheck it etc. Will keep using them! I'm  using kiwi or skyscanner for all my flights now.
5	Was lead to this site via skyscanner, i usually use a local instore travel agent. I was immensely hesitant having never used <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> before. Used the chat fuction to get answers to my 100million questions, lol.. I got Jan as a chat rep. What a fantastic rep, talked me though everything. Answered all my questions, reassured me at every step. Im sooooooo happy with my experience. Will use <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> again. Thanks so much JAN:blush:
4	The company overall is very good. Service however is a little bit hit and miss - some members were less willing to help. I'm glad i came across one of their members, Bastio who truly helped me out with my issues... Overall though super quick and easy to get into contact with on all platforms.

4	Skypicker is good and conveneient but if you fly budget and go for cheap airlines, you might have a hard time. Sometimes you have to pay to keep yourself from starving on a cramped plane.
5	Thank you Muhammed for your support with all my concerns.My flight leaves at 6 am tomorrow, is my fırst time using this platform so if all goes righ I will definitely recommend you with all my people.Thanks again.
5	great and fast services .Tnaks againg Jacob
5	I have used <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> for a few flights (when they were <http://skypicker.com|skypicker.com>) and now am using them for flights as they are <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>. I have been very appreciative of the Customer Service ability that the staff within the company has! They have done follow-up calls to make sure there were no problems with my flights, and just now I finished chatting with Jan S. through the online chat help room, and she was Incredibly helpful and polite responding to any concerns I had. I recommend this company to all of my friends because there has yet been a day where I have gotten anything less than stellar service. Bravo <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>, Bravo. - Jacob
5	Monika was really professional and answered to all my questions. Quick service & welcoming attitude! Thanks a lot!!
5	Samuel answered my questions quickly and precisely. Very friendly and helpful.
2	Very disappointed with the way they handled my wife's flight from Kuala Lumpur to Kolkata and Dimapur. First they sent wrong information on flight schedule changes, was not notified in time. Because of flight schedule changes she was going to miss her internal flight and was offered an alternative flight and it was accepted. Contacted them to confirm changes only to be told that they have not booked it and there were no more seats available - worst still when I contacted the Airlines there was one last seat available and had to book it myself.I am hoping it is probably a simple human error and not inefficiency. Not too happy.
5	I had a problem with my booking I did not receive my booking info and I contemplated whether I got scammed but after contacting the help services immediately I was answers immediately by a friendly helper, Jan Lukasek who found out the problem quicker than I could make a cup of tea. I had mistyped my email address. Then Jan fixed my error and re-sent my booking info and the problem was resolved in minutes ! Great service !
5	Can't thank the Skypicker team enough, namely Filip R, for all the help provided last week.I work for a UK charity and we previously booked a flight through Skypicker for one of our overseas Managers, David.David was due to fly out of Nepal on Saturday 19 Sep and I was personally flying in for a handover, arriving on Thursday 17.Sadly David's flight was rescheduled just a few days before and he was given a new departure date of Friday 18.This totally messed with our plans in that we had no time for a handover.I called Skypicker and Filip tried to find us a new flight that worked.  This wasn't possible but I found a new flight myself.  The problem now was that we would have to pay again and we were reluctant to spend charity funds on this.Happily Filip called both of the airlines involved and managed to secure us a refund for about 90% of the cost of the new flight.  So, we were able to stick to the original plan for very little extra cost.There was a lot of work for Filip with this process, calling the different airlines multiple times, and of course calling me to give me updates and options.Really impressed and grateful with the service.My only input for improvement is that Skypicker are based overseas and the connection was sometimes bad, but that's not Filip's fault.Thanks for all the help, particularly as I was very busy preparing for my own departure.
4	Donald was friendly and quick to responde.
5	I just booked a ticket from Germany to Edmonton for my husband few days ago the service I got was outstanding . The receptionist Kojo was awesome I will defiantly refer my friends and family to skypicker for any travel needs .Kojo was very patient understanding and polite he made sure I got what I needed before ending our call ! I'm very satisfied :) Thank u Kojo
5	Good service, great help from Michael on the online customer services team :D
5	Had a problem receiving thw email of my booking. Tamara helped me theough within a minute. Everything solved, looking forward to the flight.
5	I purchased a 23-hour journey through skypicker, it was made up of 3 connecting flights. My second flight (Royal Air Morroc) was delayed causing me to miss my next flight (Suncountry airlines)  - note that these are two different airline companies. Neither would help me out with the situation, so I called Skypicker and a very sweet lady named Oga (sp?) got me booked on the next available flight home, all at no extra cost.I won't lie, I was skeptical at first, but Skypicker (or at least Oga) have proven themselves to me. Thank you - I will be recommending this to my friends and colleagues. Keep up the good work.
5	Wait time was reasonable, a few minutes.Chat window worked well.Filip was able to understand my issue and resolved it.
5	First time I jused Kiwi :) I was wondering about check in options , the girl on live chat : DOROTA , was the best :) asked me questions if wanted more help , when I was finished . All my worries was answered by DOROTA :) thanks :heart:
4	LENKA was of great help !
5	My booking had 2 flights (layover of 2h30m). The first flight got 2 hours late and I lost the second one. Went online and talked with them on chat and within 45 minutes they booked me the next available flight. Excellent service.Customer care handler was Emma.
5	Dorota was a great help for me! She sorted everything out very quickly and helped me with filling in my passport details. Thanks!
1	Now, this is what happened...My Ryanair flight from Brussels to Lisbon was not confirmed at the time of booking. I did, however, receive an email, from Skypicker, with the e-tickets attached some 6 days before the flight. At the time of reception, I was in the middle of hopping from one plane onto another, taking an average of 2 flights each day. This must be one of the rare occasions when accessing email and printing a ticket is impossible.Since Ryanair has an app which allows passengers to board without a printed ticket, I downloaded the app and tried to get my ticket on it, but it kept saying my email address was the wrong one. After checking Ryanair's FAQ's, in which it said I needed to contact the 3rd party provider to get the correct email in order to be able to use my ticket, I started up Skypicker's online chat. I was put in touch with an operator right away.After a lengthy explanation of what I needed, I was informed that they couldn't provide me with the email address that was used for the ticket (why? I have no idea!) so I just had to find a place to print.After letting them know that was not going to be possible, because I had very little time left before boarding a previous flight, they insisted that I'd have to find a way. When I told them it would be very easy for them to just give me the email address they used, they simply stopped talking to me. I never gave them any reason to treat me like this.I have the transcript of the chat in my possession, since it was so absolutely ludicrous that I decided to keep it. Dear Skypicker management, you may want to have a look at this! Just not replying is an extremely unprofessional attitude in anyone's book!So, in my view and judging by the other comments, they are good in solving simple problems, but rather obtuse when it comes to 'real' problems. What was I going to do with your email for you to keep it such a secret? Send you a message?Ah, if you want to know, I didn't lose the flight! I was lucky that the flight to Brussels from Prague was way ahead of schedule, so I did find somewhere to print in the end. I took quite a risk to have it printed, and it went OK purely by chance. I could *easily* have lost the flight. It's good to know there are still friendly people out there (although it may have been opportunistic nicety, charging me 12 euro for 2 copies).Peter

5	It was great she was helpful
5	I was very confused it was my first in this web, but i had to contact with customer care and the answer all my questions. I had not to worry about anything and they have best prices! I will repeat sure (Sorry for my english, I'm spanish)Al principio estaba muy confuso con el servicio. Contacté con el servicio de atención al cliente y ellos solventaron todas mis dudas. No me tuve que preocupar por nada, ellos hicieron todo y ademas encontré los precios de mis billetes mas bajos que en ningún sitio. Repetiré seguro.
1	I missed my connecting flight because of human error, kiwi didn't had refund policy or any alternative solution. Yes they offered cheap service but it's not reliable. I would rather prefer other services in future than to get messed up at airport and stay long hours with sleepless. I should have read others review before buying services from <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>
5	I had a tiny problem with my name whem booking, i sent an email and I was assisted by a lovely lady called Aleksandra Mrzyglod  who took the time to listen to my query and helped me resolve the issue.Thank you very much.
5	I have not received my boarding pass and it was urgent because my flight was within 12 hours. <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> has not completed my online check-in for flight, however travel consultant Nina Kasap has reacted very quickly to my e-mail and solved the problem.
5	Their customer service is excellent. They reply immediately and fix the problem! I am impressed!
5	I had some questions about changing my itinerary and seeing what my options would be. Used the online chat to speak with Zuzana S. and she was quite wonderful. Aside from laughing at my stupid jokes, she went through every possible option for me to try and get some sort of reimbursement for my trip cancellation. While I was unable to recoup much of what I paid (it was my own fault), I feel Suzana genuinely wanted to help me the best she could. Top notch!
5	Needed to buy extra luggage and with the help of Mr Vojtech N, it was a very smooth and stressful transaction.Thanks

5	Special thanks to Anna Alexinova, who did fantastic job <http://assisting.me|assisting.me> with my online check in
4	Found last minute the only combination of flights that worked for me. Was a bit surprised that I had to wait up to 4 hours after payment to confirm the booking but this was done within minutes, after requesting this through the LiveChat service. Lenka was very helpful and efficient in dealing with the request.
5	He helped me navigate a somewhat complicated Kiwi web site. And advised me on how to get my seat assignment changed
5	Excellent and efficient service with a follow up phone call to ensure everything was now back on track. Thank you to Adam Jelink for a great service all in all taking less than 15 minutes to sortr out my problem.

5	I had Patrik Pivoda as my chat attendant. He is really knowledgable and knows exactly what my concern was. He was able to answer all my questions and was willing yo make calls to the airline that I had questions with for me.
5	From the beginning, I have received all the necessary information in a timely manner with clarity, forms and emails are easy to respond, in case of missing data, they have taken personal care and provided me with the boarding pass !
5	Really great service with a wonderful support CHAT service :D
5	NIKOLA and FILIP were super helpful and assisted me with all my travel rearrangements after I lost my passport in South America. I love Kiwi!
5	It was pretty nice journey for me,all was as i expected.Everybody was very professional  .Farkhod Kholdarov
1	Ordered two tickets. Later on I told them to cancel one of them (actually twice), which they didnt do. After that I ordered extra luggage, which they added to the ticket which should have been cancelled. They didnt ask me to specify which passenger the luggage was for anyway. They will not refund. Extremely poor service!
4	In any case, the security sister have been a nightmare!
5	tanks tomas for your help,,,you give me a beautiful and fast service

3	I was trying to book sports equipment with Skypicker but it was not a listed option on their website. I am currently waiting for them to get back to me on a price and I really hope they can help me in some way.
5	I would like to thank Aurelija for her time this week and for checking on my query.Aurelija was very easy to deal with and was extremely friendly and helpful.
5	Very precise information about the flights, including times, luggage and check in procedures. Also Kiwi checks in and sends the boarding pass to email or app. Overall, very satisfying service.
4	Jonathan just helped me out as I had forgotten to change from Mr to miss. It was great that I was guided to fill in passport number with a passport that is expiring before departure. I just wish they didn't require the passport details. Great that they can be reached 24/7.
5	Jan S. assisted me with persistence, and patience while solving my issue.  Excellent work Jan!  Thanks.

5	Hello, I have to thanks for helpful infrormation from Melinda. I look forward to holiday :-)Best regards Daniel
5	I have never heard about this site until a friend recommended to me and I was amazed how cheap the offer that was available for me in very short time before my flight.. I had no doubt I will keep using skypicker everytime I travel.. :ok_hand:
5	Thank you Ivana V. for taking the time to answer all of my questions thoroughly and make me feel well taken care of.  I appreciated your time very much and wish that all interactions with customer service could be so positive.
5	jan's sevice really helped us when we had a problem with the baggeges
5	My agent Martin Carter was extremely prompt and helpful in dealing with my request.
5	Regarding booking a flight through the side, I talked with two wonderful Representatives.mr. Jan Lukasek. & mr. Martin Carter SmehlikI must say i do Not yet found  to come across in such a kind and stands ready to help 24 hours a day. So cheek. Keep up.
5	Nina helped me out a lot when I needed to check in with Ryanair and wasn´t able to do it myself. She sent me my flight tickets so I didnt have to pay additional fees at the airport. Thanks a lot!
5	Skypicker, unlike other flight finders, not only includes smaller airlines (or less well-known domestic carriers) in its search, but also gives you prices across very broad time frames. This means you  get to see the best prices across the months, in combination with the broader search parameters. My booking was seamless. A great and reliable alternative to other flight finders, especially for the best fares and combination of fares. The best, in my opinion.
5	Thanks to Pedro's help, my problem with a boarding pass was solved in 2 minutes!
4	I am book my ticket first time in this site and It's amazing and good customer services like it and thank (Andrew.G) you help and finish my tension
5	I spoke with Zuzana and the communication it was more perfect. She was very kindly and service me very well.
1	BEWARE of this company!!! Bought fly ticket with two onboard luggage. Then asked Iryna from customer sevice for some information and she said, sorry system mistake, you have to buy 2nd luggage for another 50 euros. My bank account is closed, I have too many things now and have to leave them here.
5	I was having problems with my online check in and Olga solved it in a moment. A very successful service!
1	"I bought tickets on skypicker/kiwi and on the day of the flight they didn't even notify me that the flight had been preponed. I had to spend the entire day on the phone with them and even missed a college exam. The guy couldn't even search for a new flight on his own so I had to suggest some myself. It was so ridiculous. They were always telling me ""I'll search for a new flight and call you in 10 minutes"", and never called. I had to be checking up on them all day and of course I received a 100€ phone bill. This is the most ridiculous agency. The result was a flight that I couldn't use so almost 700€ lost because of their inefficient work. Please, just look for different ones or buy tickets directly from the company. This agency is a joke."
5	I have used <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> for the last few flights I have purchased (between Asia - Australia - Europe) and each time I am left highly satisfied with the service.First of all, as I have found, it is the cheapest way of purchasing tickets. I was very impressed by the way in which you can search flights, see clearly cheaper days of travel and compare.The whole booking process was pretty simple and you get instant feedback and confirmation.I had some minor problems with one booking as my ticket had name spelling mistakes but the customer service team were very quick to respond to the matter and get it resolved. The customer service is really next to none, they are highly efficient, friendly and very quick to respond. The 24/7 service is fantastic. All round I have had a great experience using <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> and will surely keep using it - and recommending it!
5	i made mistake by my booking and i got absolutly perfect and speed service.everytime again.
5	This is CHO, I am really appreciated for your reponsivenness !!!!
5	I had a lot of help from Olga. She helped me in a calm way with my check in. Congratulations for your help and support!Thank you!
5	I didnt get confirm mail because of my fault, and I contact the company with chat. Lucie G fixed my fault, so I finally got email!  She was really nice. Thank you!!
5	I had a long long journey to the other side of the world and one of my flights was delayed almost 3 hours. Considering that I had another connection afterwards, I was really worried and stressed, not to mention really tired.Lukas P helped me a lot, very fast and trustworthy. He found me a solution and also calmed me down.Definitely will use the service again.
3	I hope this is not try!!
5	I would like to express my special thanks to Margarita. I booked my tickets accidentally on 6th of January instead of 9th, it was the same day and the same time tho. I realised it once I paid. I contacted 5' while I realised the mistake with  one of the employees but she didn't want to help me at all. She was speaking good English but she was foreigner definitely, she offered me  to change the flight which was £600, both tickets costed £120. I hanged up  and called again. I spoke with Margarita, she understood that to do this and mistake is possible, so she helped me out. I told her, if you do help to avoid this expenses, this will be the reason to still book my tickets from your company. She did it, she changed my flight without to spend any penny. So, I am responsible of my word and I ll still buy tickets from Kiwi. Thanks a lot Margarita and the manager who authorised this request for me. Appreciated.
5	I made a mistake with my daugthers sur name when i booked my tickets yesterday. I called Kiwi and Lucky for me it was Lorena who recieved my call. Normally the airplan compagny charge people when something have to be corrected but Lorena was super awesome and helped me change the name without cost. - The service Lorena provided was fantastic.
5	Satisfied with help i have got from support, it was Jan Lukasek who helped me solve my issue and so far i can only recommend Kiwi.
5	We faced difficulties in using the aipad to input details of passport and ID cards. Also  I had input a wrong birth date for one of the passengers. I requested live- chat support...and it worked and extremely quickly and competent. After a few minutes and a single additional email...everything was ok. Im deeply impressed. Great and Thank you
1	I travel a lot and am used to dealing with travel agents and airlines but i would like others that if you have an option to book directly with the airline or have a choice of another travel agency use them as opposed to KIWI. I recently made a booking from Canada to Europe and realized that there a transit in London which required me to take my luggage and re-check it in for the second leg of the journey. Considering that i have an injured shoulder, i decided that this was not a good option for me so i wanted to cancel my booking and choose a more convenient flight.I called <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> within 24 hours of my booking and requested for a cancellation and full refund of my ticket. Understanding that each airline has a 24 hour refund policy minus the adminstrative fees i knew that i would not receive the exact amount i paid but would be refunded most of the fare.After going through back and forth communication with the customer support I was told that i would not receive my full refund due to administrative fees. I then asked for a full breakdown of all the costs associated with the administrative fees and i was told that it is complicated to get the breakdown of costs and it is being investigated.I don't understand how administrative costs can be over 200 Euros when the flight is cancelled within 24 hours. All airlines involved have full refund policy and administrative fees not exceeding 20 Euros each. And if Kiwi adds an administrative fee of 20 Euros the total administrative costs should not exceed 60 Euros.I find this very shady and inconsistent. It has been over 10 days now and I have not received my refund or correspondence from Kiwi.I am very disappointed and I hope others do not make the same mistake.Thanks
5	This gentleman was absolutely terrific helping me modify my reservations.  He was informed, prompt, and very kind.  My experience was absolutely 5 star!
5	Great service, great website. Miroslava P was really helpful on the live chat too to get my boarding passes sorted early! :)
5	Kiwi made the impossible flight connection we needed from London to Cluj Romania possible to an affordable rate, and with brilliant customer service! Thank you very much, you will be my first go to booking agent moving forward! Nina
5	Thank you so much for your assistant's Elena Sh you have been a great assit to the team I'm sure.. Excellent service and sorted all my worries out in a timely manner thanks again have a great day Elena Sh.Ora.
1	I have called to tell you that my daughter is having problems with her suitcase which we paid $150 for because you issue 2 tickets from Texas to Las Vegas and to San Diego she had to stay at the airport for 10 hours without eating just to find out that she has to leave her bag again because she had to pay another hundred and fifty I think it's unfair if we already paid once why we have to pay again because you gave us two different tickets and u will  not combined them she had to leave everything behind. Everything she owns... I call your airline and they were insensitive to the matter so my opinion on your airline.... your airline sucks...thanks for a nothing..
5	Good evening.I want to share that this company is so nice. Today I had a problem about my flight, I asked help, and they offered a good solution, I am so happy for that. I will continue to buy in <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>. Especially you, Filip thank you so much for your help I really appreciate it.
5	I found <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> to be very easy to use, efficient and problem free. I find that it can sometimes be a little tense using low cost airlines with all their strict rules but I was very impressed with <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> because they gave clear and concise instructions in the booking email they sent to me.
5	Transparent pricing was especially good!
5	Great and fast service, thank you Vlad :)
4	My experience was very good, about the service in chat, it was comfortable and very pleasant. Thank you for answer my questions.
5	@sebmck <https://t.co/RfiEPKQEIj> best site fo searching low cost airlines in Europe
5	I  the reservation with your company to Germany and the next day I send an email for wheelchair  and after that I am receiving a phone call telling me that we are helping you to get the wheelchair and the one who call me was very polite and helpful thank you
1	I got a mail yesterday. that is a flight booking information malI what I don't know. Cuz I list my credit card. So I reported to the police and card office and checked the booking on Skypicker website and clicked cancel button before confirmed!! But unfortunately , I received confirm mail..so I sent e-mail to Skypicker support address yesterday like this. I show you the details next.Dear manager.I have some problem that is the booking(I don't know about it cuz I lost my credit cardso I didnt do booking). Today, I received an information mail and confirmed mail too. But I didn't want it so called your office and told one service rep(I don't know his name) this story. And I clicked cancel button before booking confirm.But the booking is confirmed and I got a SMS(credit card using notice). Now, I reported to the police and card company too. So I want to refund the flight booking. If you don't do that, your service is faulty!!I already checked airline(Cebu pacific & Air Asia) about this problem and they told, refund is available. I think you can solve well this problem. I expect the problem will be solved ASAP.thank you for reading.But they no answer, already read my mail!!!!!I am getting angry. I think service of Skypicker is terrible.let me tell you guys, dont do booking by Skypicker!
5	tamar was really perfect . thanks
5	Donald Kumi-Agyare did a great job making a schedule work for us.  Skypicker routing helped us meet our group on time.  Thanks to Donald and Skypicker.
5	"Using Skypicker when buying your tickets is a great option as, not only they do not add extra taxes to the (sometimes very expensive) tickets while you are buying them, but also they make the trip easier, more comfortable and more enjoyable since they make all the ""paperwork"" for you. So I highly recommend it to everyone, specially those who tend to ""forget"" to do the check-in online a few days before flying or those who have a connection flight (and need to do two or more check-in). You just buy the ticket and forget about everything else as the only thing you need to do is to download the boarding pass!"
5	Zdanka B. Help me really good and fast. I had a question about the bagagges and she gave me the answer that I need. Great service!
5	Skypicker is reliable,the Live Chat assistance is attentive and quick,I was assist by Phana and i was really impressed with the service,i also assist by some agent before at skypicket cht and they are attentive, i will be booking through skypicker again and again.thank you
1	When I searched for a one-way trip from Bucharest to JFK on <http://kayak.com|kayak.com>, <http://skypicker.com|skypicker.com>, was one of the listings. I had no idea it was a low cost operator. I've flown this route at least once a year for the past 10 years, but this is a first.There was absolutely no indication that I am buying a low cost ticket. Whereas there's nothing wrong with low cost, I wish I had know about it before, key word, before booking, since there's considerable additional cost 25 to 30% for baggage, food and even water on board! Can anyone imagine flying 8 hours without a glass of water?!?!Actually, it was so misleading that in the upper right corner it had the following listed: 1Xcarry-on ---- FREE, 0 x checked-in luggage --- Free. Why list something that is not offered (zero) as FREE? Because people are used to have one carry-on and one piece of luggage checked in for Free and they think they're getting the same deal as usual when in fact, they're being tricked into something else.Very upset about the whole deal and won't use, even if I ever need low-cost.
4	Very Good Customer Service. Responsive and addressing the issue smoothly. I hope my customer experience will be like that all the way through :) Keep it up Skypicker!
5	I was helped by Nina and she sorted and explained everything!
2	@skypickercom ..check in and do immigration again when we bought one ticket and the airline was the same. Absolutely pointless!!!! (2/2)
5	Sasha was very helpful and nice when I called to solve my luggage issues. An example of perfect client service!
5	"Woow loads of people who gave 1*. I am sorry to see that. I want, still, to thank Irina for being so kind and for giving me all the info i wanted...or...almost all. At the moment i am 50% happy. The rest of 50% i will be when the money will reach my Account and then i will make another post here to let everyone know if they are ""put the money where the mouth is""....so if they are people of honor. Till then, only the best!"
4	The service was very good. They even called me from abroad to clarify when an issue was not clear. I would definitely book with them again.
5	This is my first time using Kiwi and so far everything has been organized. I had a few questions about the boarding passes and Viktor P. helped me understand how it works and walk me through the process. So far so good. Thanks
5	Thanks to Selorm for his gentle help
5	I had Katerina as my agent and she helped me through some queries i had regarding my first flight. As you can imagine, i was slightly nervous due to not really knowing what i was doing, but she helped me through and resolved all issues i had. Would definitely recommend Kiwi to a friend.
5	As said in the title, my passport details within 15 minutes after I sent my message, and it was very polite reply by Victoriya Ginyatulina. I really appreciate swift and kind replies, so thank you very much for the effort and keep up with the good service :)!
5	I missed the deadline for the online-check-in and panicked because it can cost about 280 EUR fee to check-in at the airport. it was sunday 7 pm, when I called the customer service of <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com>. It didn't take more than 5 minutes and I got a very friendly consultant, named Theodor. He allied me and solved my problem in less than 15 minutes an was always friendly and caring. I do not know what I would have done without you.Thank you so much Theodor. :)
5	My flight was delayed and I missed my connection in Orladno. During a day I had a lot of chats with a customer service! I thank Olga and Ekaterina for thier patience! And special thank David who found a brilliant alternative flight!
5	Roman Slobodyan, in particular was extremely helpful.  My flight was delayed by 6 hrs departing LAX to Copenhagen which caused me to miss my connection from Copenhagen to Prague.  Roman scrambled to find me an alternative connection through Berlin, and though I needed to stay the night in the Copenhagen airport instead of my hotel in Prague, I made it to my business meeting - couldn't have done so without Roman's help and that of his colleagues.  They were efficient, curteous, honored the Kiwi guarantee: helping cover a significant portion of the cost of the new flight, and delivering excellent customer service.
5	Miroslav was friendly and helped me resolve all my issues!
1	I was had a surgery, so i have to cancel my tickets, I already spend almost a week to used online chat, phone call to cancel my tickets. First, they said can't cancel my tickets even i had a surgery, I was really shocked, so i called the Airasia told them all my situation also send email for tham to provide it my surgery file, after Airasia agree with me to refund, but need <http://KIWI.COM|KIWI.COM> contact with them, after finished call, i called <http://KIWI.COM|KIWI.COM> but different customer support just told me need waiting 3~4 hours and another one told me in 4 hours and i keep waiting over and over again also they promised me will contact with Airasia for cancel my tickets every single time, and after i called Airasia to make sure <http://KIWI.COM|KIWI.COM> contact yet or not, they told me no one called them, no email send for them, i really confused so i called the <http://KIWI.COM|KIWI.COM> again, however,  they told me already called also send email for tham, but it was not truth! I don't understand why need waiting so long and why lie to customer just for one call? Today customer support told me will contact me in 4 hours,,,, but now ,,, already over 6 hours, still no one contact me,, please, just please don't lie to customer alright! I already used a week to cancel my tickets now i only have 4 days to cancel my tickets..         I THINK <http://KIWI.COM|KIWI.COM> IS AN IRRESPONSIBLE COMPANY.
5	Everything went smoothly, I receive my confirmation after few minutes, I went to the chat support to ask some questions and Tomas was very helpful , definitely I will book again
5	I had to call Kiwi earlier today and Natalia looked after me. She was very helpful and looked after my issue. Thanks Natalia!
5	Martin Carter, thank you for helping us with all the necessary procedures associated with our journey. Posting this review while already having a great time in France. Thanks mate!
5	Thanks for helping us out Olga. We are looking forward to our trip.
5	I just made a reservation and everything looks great so far. Thanks in special to Miquel for his kind assistance. Highly recommended!
5	I am so pleased to book my flight with <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> and was well served with all my questions I asked either via phone or Live chat.All customer rep's were so helpful an very professional, and I got my answers right away with less waiting time.
5	Jakub was very helpful for my check in, thans
5	Excellent customer support,  quick,  effective,  a great plus for a business that already offers great prices!  Thank you Milica for helping me tonight!
5	I would use Skypicker again without hesitation.I had a little trouble keeping myself organized on my trip due to a handful of technical issues and jet lag. No fault of Skypicker, but they were quick to answer the phone/email, resend my boarding passes, and keep me informed of my request for a change after booking (I made an oops when booking and didn't catch it before finalizing my reservation). I'm very happy with the service I received and highly recommend them.

5	Filip on the live chat helped me navigate some confusing aspects of the site & solved my problem quickly and professionally.
5	Fast and reliable help by the travel consultant Lucie O'Bryan. Thank you very much!
3	Yet the NYCDOB squashed the use of the Skypicker from Vertikal Lifting Solutions which had zero safety issues.   <https://t.co/2KVVsm7Ftc>
5	On time!Everything was clear:the site,the booking procedures,emails,explanations..
5	I had the pleasure of being helped in the customer service by Nikola. She was very informative and helpful during the process, and I can't put my finger on anything that could've been done better. Well done!
5	I had made a typo in passenger name. Immediately went tho their customer service chat and they were able to change it before the booking was processed. Great help from Sena to fix my mistake.
5	So far I am very pleased with SkyPicker.The 24/7 online service is really convinient. Nice and helpful staff at the desks.
4	I wanted help to.manage my booking and an agent named Vlad answered quickly enough and helped me, looked for every possible way to solve my problem and also told me some tips to have in mind each time I am having a flight. Thanks a lot!!
5	i help me to make the check in on line tks very much name is Archie
5	I tried Kiwi for the first time to book our ticket to Europe. I was pleasantly surprised to find many affordable options on their site. But my surprise grew even further when I started receiving personalized emails and responses to my inquiries from the company's employees. Because it was a new airline and new way of booking I had many questions regarding the flight, the insurance, etc. Petra Musilova from Kiwi was very prompt and detailed in her responses. I am very happy with my experience and expect to become a loyal customer. Thanks, Kiwi.
5	Thank you, Julia G., for your assistance with entering my information to my booking!  Julia was super helpful and efficient.  It was a great customer service experience overall.
5	Would like to thank for such a quick positive answer on my ask to change part of details in my reservation. Best service. Will recommend to my Friends without any doubt. Thank you again!
5	The service is amazing, very friendly and helpful (Henri)! Made a short intercontinental trip in europe and now i booked my asian-trip with skypicker!
5	Although I do not know of <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> intimately but I availed of their services  because it responds to my travel needs, plain and simple BUT, this was put to the test when the boarding pass issued to us was for a later date. Fortunately, my concern was handled by Neil and Mohamed. Two of the most efficient customer service representatives I have ever met in my various travels. Even if we only communicate digitally but I felt the sincerity of their responses and actions to my requests. I am one happy traveler, thanks to these guys! Truly superb customer care! Thank you!
4	Thank you for all your help and useful information, Zuzana. I would definitely recommend it to a friend and I am very glad with my first kiwi experience.
5	RT @curtischoi: Just bought tickets to go to our honeymoon in Europe this summer! Excellent deals and a customer service! @skypickercom
5	Luis S. has helped me tremendously much with sorting out boarding tickets and e-tickets. I was very stressed out when I got the wrong tickets but the amazing online chatting solved everything. Thank you once again Luis S.
4	The website is mostly easy to use and gives many flight options which can be ordered by price or by duration. I was a little confused by one thing concerning the online check-in after paying for my tickets, so I used the online chat on the help section of the website; a person called Samael kindly and thoroughly explained everything to me. I give the website 4/5 stars and the online help 5/5 stars.
5	That's my first time to use skypicker. I want to mention, that chat client support is really helpful. The chat center operator Alan answered all the questions and was very nice and friendly as well :) I think I gonna use this site again.
5	We arrived to Rome on a ship and had problems getting boarding cards for the airflight home. These documents were sent to my emailaddress so we could print them on the ship, very practical and handy !
5	Thanks Alan you're a champion!!
5	Used Skypicker for the first time last week and was amazed at the fantastic one-way fares available - in my case up to 70% cheaper than via airlines&#39; sites.  I think Skypicker have cottoned on to a great business model marrying unused inventory on individual sectors with demand while not restricting the traveler to use only one airline or one of the alliance members.  I am confident that this model is set to significantly grow.
5	Excellent service. Martin Walker was a great help with the booking and had a very professional approach.
5	handled my cancellation properly. great folks, honest company. will definitely work with them in my next trip.
5	Best flight agency I've used.Special thanks to Lucie G for being so helpful.
5	Very happy with <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>. All details covered with excellent communication.I was able to obtain much cheaper airfares with high quality economy airlines. Definitely recommend this service.
5	Skypicker can be trusted to give excellent service
1	@skypickercom would be wonderful, have to use something called <http://letenky.sk|letenky.sk> for booking :(
4	Even better! A startup that finds 'hidden' discount flight tickets just launched in the US <https://t.co/iPQFaBc1Qw> via @sai
4	Tamara just helped me clarify a question I had about luggage. She was really helpful.  It seemed that I did not have a 23kg bag included (according to my reservation in kiwi) in my trip but it turns out I do have an included piece of luggage for my first two flights. This saved me the trouble and money to pay for extra luggage since I'm planning on leaving the bag at my first destination. It would be nice if the reservation page in Kiwi was a bit more specific in regards to which flights include an extra 23kg bag and which don't. best,Ernesto
2	I used <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> to book a flight from Barcelona back to Los Angeles recently.  Kiwi's service does not allow you to check in online for flights so you have to show up earlier to the airport to do so.  However in the case of layovers, they don't book the tickets properly so can't get your boarding pass for the second flight until you are in the second airport which required us to wait in a second line in the UK for over 2 HOURS to get our second boarding pass.  If our flight had not been delayed by an hour we would have definitely missed our flights.  Then when we got on our 11 hour flight from the UK to Los Angeles we were told that the only way we could receive meals and beverages as part of  the flight service was if we had done so well in advance of the flight... which was impossible because of booking through Kiwi.com... Therefore, every time we wanted a water or snack we had to pay for it.  YES.... EVEN WATER!!! We had to pay over $25 for water our flight.  This was by far one of the worst booking experiences I've ever had.  Do yourself a favor a spend the extra $50 or so bucks booking through another company so it can be done right.
1	I booked flights here and I had a terrible experience here. The consultant helped me check-in online because there was no column for me to fill in my passport information, while Kiwi kept asking me to finish my online check-in. When I departed, I realized the consultant has allocated my friend and me MORE THAN 15 ROWS apart. It was totally NONSENSE as there was actually no one sit next to me. I tried to ask the consultant to change either my or my friend’s seat, but the consultant refused and said no change is available in 48 hours before the flight. I asked for the reason for “15 rows apart” but the consultant told me it was of security reason with no further details. Security reason....REALLY? Everyone here please be caution when you try to conduct online check-in through the consultants here.
5	kiwi make me angry but Aliaksandra make me happy : )When i book my flight ticket, kiwi site loading is so slow so I was angry. But i chatted with Aliaksandra, she is so kind and helpful people so i got a lot of information and something. My english is not good, but Aliaksandra is understood my mean so very easy to find information. Thanks !
1	Worst company ever!!!! They didnt want to change my flight for a different time until i pay triple the flight cost!!!! However, my reservation was made less than 24 hours!!!!!!!I called united and fixed it! And then they sent me an email that they changed for me! What? Excuse me? No that was United not you!!!Would never book with them again!!;)
5	SkyPicker was able to find me a unique and cheap itinerary that I didn't find at any other search engine from Seville to Prague. SkyPicker automatically processed my tickets and checked me in. The site was easy to use. Well done!
1	I am really disappointed with Skypicker, booked my flight, paid for surcharges for luggages which accordingly to Skypicker could go up to 20kgs with Tiger air, but once at the counter of the airport very unpleasant surprise that only 15kgs were allowed... We had to throw away quite a lot of things that I wasn't planning on throwing because once at the airport surcharge is 25$ per kg (so for twice 5kgs extra I make you do the calculation). You just can't trust the company to give you the right amount, please double or triple check the original company fares and surcharges allowed !
1	These guys are just middle men and they do not have the tickets on hand.
4	Great offers and very quick response. I also got very good rates. Totally recommended.
5	I was extremely happy with the professional service provided by Eric.He was through with his work and provided me all the necessary info and went extra mile for me. I would recommend him and his company anytime. We will surely be back again,
5	I would like to say a massive thank you to your on line services. I recently booked a flight through kiwi and knowing if a problem should a raise I can connect them. I was a rep for many tour company's and I've never ever knowen this just booking a flight. It's so reassuring  and peace of mind to know you care. I will defiantly without a doubt recommend my family and friends and tell them how efficient and caring you have been this means everything.  Thank you again. June McNarry.
5	Though I waited on the phone for a while because they're busy, I assume, Ms. Puput was very helpful, informative and took great care of my complicated identification switching situation for several flights that I had to change information on. She was positive and kind on the phone and promptly took care of my situation and I am. Dry greatful for her help. This process was so easy, especially for a clueless student during exams and I appreciate it.
5	The team is wonderful. Everyone literally goes above and beyond to help you. I was explained the same matter multiple times because I didn't understand it the first time. They were extremely diligent at helping me find information about my luggage (cost + dimensions), and given that my trip included several different airlines they had to do tedious work to find out all of the information I needed. The entire personnel has a lot of charisma and is willing to help you all the way. They made me happy every time I talked with them. I spoke with several different people, but Bogdan was the nicest and sweetest. He tried reaching me several times over the phone to keep me informed about the cost of my luggage. He didn't mind that I couldn't get to my phone, he just continued trying to help me.It may seem like a hassle to purchase a ticket that includes several airlines, but I'm saving over $500 dollars (luggage included) by using Kiwi (the various airlines with which they are connecting me) compared to using a more popular airline. The other tickets I had searched for the same date were over $1,100. With Kiwi I was able to purchase it for less than $400.The company is also great because it sends you emails reminding you to submit your passport information and to print out the required paperwork...all with the purpose of making your trip be less stressful at the airport. Best of all, they are available 24/7!
5	I am not used to booking a ticket at all so bothered the representative, Sena by asking fundamental questions, but she kindly corresponded all the time. Thanks a lot.
5	Many thanks to Youssef Archil!!! He was our hero for today and for our trip ;) We needed to add extra kilo to the checked luggage and he find a solution even if in generally, according to Skypicker terms & conditions we cannot make changes if it is less than 48 hours before departure. But Archill listen to our needs very careful and with his good attitude, clear mind and opened heart fixed every issue. He saved our money, energy and time, and definitely give us an excellent start for the trip. I think he is a valuable asset for his team and company. Adriana & Sorin are grateful to him and thus to Skypicker for having ;) If all the team are like Archill, be sure that you won a long - term partnership. Congratulations and many thanks to you!
5	Always the best flights and now also can say that the customer service is absolutely great and prompt following a minor yet urgent issue (with thanks to Tetiana Pomogaieva & Dmytro R.). Definitely recommend!
5	Made the mistake of booking my flight from the incorrect airport. Cancelled immediately yet contacted the live chat support as well, just in case. A thousand thanks to you, Stan, for helping me to cancel the flight and getting a refund!
5	I made a mistake while booking, but Simon could help me very quickly and he was very friendly.Thank you very much for this good customer support.Sincerly Vivian Efthymiadou
5	Easy to use and Miguel in customer service was very helpful. I will be using this site again in the future!
4	Flight was good - when we arrived at Barcelona airport to fly home the check in was easy - the checkin staff member was extremely helpful and arranged a wheelchair for my elderly father who was travelling with our party! The only criticism I have was that we were delayed by 30 mins and at no time were any announcements made  to let passengers know what was happening and there were no staff to ask at he gate. Overall I would use your company again - first time flyer with you but not last!!!
1	I bought tickets but the name on one of them was missing. I contacted with support service but they didnt change the name on the ticket.
5	We had problems checkin in online, so we decided to call Skypicker, Neil kindly helped us! We were very impressed with the good costumer service :)
5	A flight got rescheduled on a budget airline, seems to happen a lot on budget airlines, and Skypickers guarantee kicked in to find an alternative booking.My reroute was a bit awkward as my 14 year old son was traveling on his own and I really  appreciated the efforts to get a safe route with minimal layovers. It took a few attempts to make us happy, thanks to James, Emmet and others I know the rescheduling was not their fault but great guarantees you provided and a great service in helping find a suitable route. I will definitely be using you guys again and highly recommending to my friends.
5	I'm glad I have found a very cheap flight to go back home, thanks to Skypicker. It's a little confusing for luggages as I have chosen a flight with two different companies, so different luggages policies and it can be so complicated.. Be careful ! But the team at Skypicker, they are all very sweet and helpful. James was the best, he really tried to find solutions to help and managed to reassure me a few days before the flight. Thanks again !
5	Very quick and efficient help!Kristina B. is the person that helped me with my request for correcting my booking
4	Fine option for no-frills travel. But note hefty charges for checked baggage!
5	MIROSLAV WAS THE PERSON WHO ANSWER THE CHAT, AND HE WAS VERY PROFFESIONAL FIXING THE PROBLEM I HAD WITH THE ONLINE CHECK- IN.
4	The booking was going through some technical problems, and the team really made everything that was necessary to make me feel comfortable and have the problem solved ASAP. Thanks to agents Martin Carter and Petr on the live chat.
5	Nice experience. The online chat operators were very efficient :)
4	Dear EricYour friendly-good mood on the phone help me to understand the procedures about the check in ! I really appreciate your help and information about my ititnerary I willl definetely trust this company for my next flight.BEst,
5	Great service, sorted in minutes
1	"This company does not inspire confidence when trying to plan a vacation. Came across <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> and <http://justfly.com|justfly.com> after using <http://Kayak.com|Kayak.com> for the first time. I purchased a flight out to Europe through <http://justfly.com|justfly.com> and return flight with <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com>, but realized within 2 hours of purchase that the dates I had were not right. <http://Justfly.com|Justfly.com> was so easy to contact and cancel the flight since it was within a couple hours it was completely free (which is the case in the US when cancelling flights within 24 hours). When I contacted <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> about the same problem, they said I had to call all the airlines myself and they would refund me the money once the airlines refunded them the money. Two weeks later I had to contact them again and they stated they just were refunded by the airlines and that they were going to refund me. Come to find out, I was assessed a $300 service fee by <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> on a $1300 flight I cancelled within 2 hours of purchasing and when I contacted them about it, they told me there was nothing they could do about it and it was in the ""terms and conditions"" before purchasing. There was no mention of this fee or difference in refund amount when coordinating with customer service prior.Looking forward, I would just deal with the airlines directly (since <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> made me do this anyways and accessed a large service fee on top of it) or I would use <http://justfly.com|justfly.com> as they seem to care about the customer/repeat customer. If you use <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>, MAKE SURE to read all the fine print and hope your trip goes exactly as planned."
5	I received help from Arsen Jomardyan and it was so helpfull. I think the prices are excellent and the assistance you bring is excellent.You don´t have to be and expert or something like that because they have a chat or a telephone where you can ask for help.
5	Our flight was pushed back and we had to book a flight on the prior day and Lukas wasn't a great help with making sure we had a flight secured! Thank you
1	I've booked on Skypicker two round trips from Italy to Scotland for 205 euros each on Ryanair. As expected for this price, no checked bag was included. I need to add at least one but on the Skypicker website a single 15kg bag would cost me 230 euros, more than the ticket. The Ryanair website says that it would cost 30 euros. Even assuming that I have to pay the price of the bag for each leg of the trip (two flights to get to Scotland, two to come back) the total price should be lass than half of what Skypicker is asking.It is unacceptable to inflate the prices like this and I'm not sure if this is intentional or some sort of error. The travel is not starting well...
5	Eleonora C. was very kind and helpful, all my problems were resolved quickly. Thank you very much for your help
4	When I booked airplane, I inserted wrong something.But Web page was not corrected my information, so I use 'live chat' service.I solve my problem so easy because my advisor Irina is so kind and helpful. Thanks to her very much.
3	thanks God, it was not necessarry to use their services further.
5	So refreshing to find a company with first class customer service.   We accidentally got the name wrong on a booking which would normally result in having to purchase another ticket with any other company but not this one.  Absolutely no problem in solving our error.  Well done and thank you.
5	Great support, especially during emergencies. The chat contacts are helpful and swift, and try to answer questions and accommodate where possible. (Many thanks for the agent, Martina, who helped us resolve an emergency situation! Everything worked out perfectly.)
5	I would like to thank Dorota Žigová  for a great job and patience with me :)Excellent customer service at <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com>!
4	I had some problems with the airline and flight schedule, but luckily Kiwi fixed within a couple of hours :-)
5	i can't english well, but my chat supporter(Lukas) is very kind. thank you lukas. because of him my trip will be happy.
5	Needed help with a name change on connecting flight. Very helpful and quickly sorted by Martin Helísek. Many thanks to Kiwi
5	Nothing but an unexpected pleasant experience.... Not one problem and the tickets were super cheap!
5	Everything went fine, very helpful support staff so very satisfied
1	Went to cancel flight after securing travel insurance and all they did was take my money - no help recovering funds.  DO NOT USE THIS SITE!
5	I love how Borbara answered my inquiries regarding baggage allowance. Its just a lil bit unclear thats why i need to asked it and i was actually getting grumpy cos shes asking questions on me. She just wanna help me find out wat i really wanna know. Shes too nice having that patience on me and shes one of the agent that should be worth keeping for. Very friendly and she helps me a lot with it. I hope all  the customer service agent will be as nice as her. Keep up the good job and i wish u all the best. Goodluck Borbara..thumbs up. Btw the site has cheaper flight tickets than others.
5	Eva respoded to all my queries quickly and efficiently!
5	I had an issue with my boarding pass for my upcoming flight. The customer service helped me solve my problem and guaranteed me that I'll get the pass as soon as possible. Special thanks to Tomas L. Really kind, quick and helpfull answers. Keep up the good work.
5	In an emergency I booked a flight on <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> and within 5 minutes of completing the booking they sent an email asking to confirm the payment by credit card. Having phoned the number provided in the email, they efficiently and kindly dealt with the issue, even offering to speed up the procedure as the flight will be departing in less than 7 hours.The only slight potential hitch on <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> could be for non-English speakers - the regional help-desks aren't available 24/7. However this was no problem for me.Thanks for a great service!
4	had problem with my first chat support where the person didnt really solve my problem (boarding pass was not sent to me on the 28th of november even though the eticket says it should be available from the 28th).tried for the second time on the 30th of november and this time Andrii solved my problem immediately and sent me my boarding pass straight away after i query about it (within a few minutes).Thanks andrii and skypicker, i hope the rest of my boarding pass will be forwarded to me smoothly instead of needing me to query about it again. keep it up with your effort!lesson learnt, you just have to try it with another person if the first one doesnt solve your problem.
5	I was just put in contact with the agent Eva to ask about some information I was not sure about and let me say she was a really helpful and kind.Now that is how customer service is suppose do be.Good Job guys!
5	Julia helped me to fix my problem with my ticket:) thanks for the good service
5	Absolutely great service. Stan was very quick to get back to me when I had questions and was very helpful.
5	Haven flown yet but had some issues/questions regarding weight allowances. Staff...
5	Huge thanks to Sena for being efficient and professional answering my query. Cheers!
4	They manage my checkin in a eficient and kind chat conversation (with Eleonora). Very effient indeed.
5	Had to ask about something twice through the live chat and got helped perfectly twice (although the live chat system itself sucks), especially the second time round where I had misentered the expiration date of my travel docment (thanks Erol!). The software of the entire booking process is great, although it can still use some minor touches. None the less would totally recommend it.
1	Last week we planned a last-minute trip to Madrid from Basel and chose a flight from Kiwi. It takes about 4 Hours to get the confirmation and since I did not receive it I called Customer Service. They informed me that the flight was overbooked and offered me another one departing two hours later, not mentioning that this flight was aprox. 170 EUR cheaper!  I called back since I haven’t received the Etickets to ask for a refund for the difference and after a couple of minutes discussing with the Customer Support Agent, I “coincidentally” received immediately the Eticket so I was not able to cancel the flight and book the less expensive. First and last time that we use KiWI…Terrible and highly questionable Ethical practices…
5	I really feel like i did a great decision by choosing this service to order my flight. representative  named Vojta m. Was very nice and kindly and didnt let the conversation end till I understood everything. Thank you for being so helpful and nice.
3	And guess who funds the awards they get? You gottit, skypicker
5	I got pretty good information and tips when i contacted skypicker. I talked to someone by the name Eszter B. A really helpful person and was doing a great job answering my questions. I also got fast respons. I would recommand booking through skypicker, it's easy to get in touch with them. You can even chat with them, and they are available 24/7! A+++++ for the service and the help i got.
5	I received super friendly and informative help Anna Kayuda from <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>. Highly recommend this booking site!

3	We can to book via Skypicker since our search via skyscanner brought us here. Since we were already on this page with all the details, we didn't mind booking via Skypicker instead of browsing up the same flights on the ryanair website and avoid having to book the two flights separately, since our arrival and return flights are different.The booking itself seemed straightforward. When it came to the point of online check-in for our flights, things started to go wrong. Whilst with ryanair you can check-in online up to 2 hours prior flight, you have to check-in by latest 72 hours upfront. So, when we were trying to check-in online 2 days upfront, skypicker no longer gives us the option. We tried to check in directly on ryanair, however, with the Skypicker booking references nor with the flight details, card details, it was impossible for ourselves to check-in online. We ended up checking in with the etickets of Skypicker at the airport costing us £90, which was more the the full tickets cost of our journey.Upon that, we obviously tried to avoid paying the same amount again for the return flight. Even though, we were more than 72 hours upfront of the return flight, again via the Skypicker site, we were not given the option for check-in online but only the etickets with the note to print it out and check in at the airport. We then contacted the given contact on Skypicker's website with no response.Then finally, we tried the live contact on the website which did not work for the first three times. After half hour, we finally were able to lead a full chat with Abigail Aurisla Mensah (Travel consultant of Skypicker), who thankfully was able to assist us. She then took our details and check us in online straight away. We are happy with her fast and efficient services and wish to note the average rating of our review today is thanks to her help.Our recommendation is that particularly for low-cost carriers such as ryanair, most likely it may be best and rather straight-forward to book directly on their own website if the prices make no difference.
5	I couldn't get hold of my reservation at the Airlines so I called for assistance at Kiwi.I was helped by Eric who not only found the reservation but also got us checked in.The service was excellent and I was called afterwards to follow up if everything was ok - which it was.
5	Just received help from the agent Alikhan, who in 5 minutes clarified my doubts and made sure I got all the informations I was looking for. Great service!
5	Excellent customer service! I had a couple doubts regarding the checkin process and how the boarding passes should be printed. Francesco answered all my questions in a very professional and concise way. I will, without a doubt, recommend Skypicker to everyone. Specially if they call the italian line.keep up the good work guys!
5	Not only is Skypicker easy to use, it also makes it super easy to book trips.You can start off by seeing all of the available connections from your airport and picking your trip based on many filters (for example - you can set the preferred duration of the trip). After the simple and straightforward booking and payment process, they take care of everything. They even do the check-in for you!I'd strongly recommend Skypicker to anyone that wants to buy airplane tickets online!
5	I was entrusted to the care of Dominika in regards to a problem checking in directly with the airline. She was incredibly helpful and took care of it in record time, much to my enjoyment and surprise.Will definitely keep booking my flight with <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> in the future, never had any problem whatsoever.
5	Thank you for helping me solve my problem with the tickets (labeled as technical issue on the side of the travel company) within 3 minutes. <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> provides excellent and quick help service.Zuzana

5	It's very easy to buy tickets here and after it i received excellent customer support - Patrik's answers really helped me figuring out some things about flights with layover and extra baggage. Thanks!
5	Petra M helped me patiently and thoroughly to get my wish.
3	Skypicker offers flights for up to 90 percent less with a cloud-based ticketing portal <https://t.co/2Dm8LB5nUI>
5	Jonathan was very helpful.he made sure I got my conformation email.i will be using sky picker services for my next travel.  Thank you
5	The spoken english of the oeprator was excellent.I wrote a couple of times and had an answer in avery short time. Sure I will try again to get the best ticket prices.thank you
5	Very kind and friendly staff. They were all helpful with me and they solved my request very quickly. I noted immediatly their seriousness. I hope to find their disposability even in the other phase of my trip and in the future.
5	Recently had to make a change to my booking. James was very helpful and patient with me, highly recommend these guys!
5	Michael at skypicker is the best customerservice agent!! He helped us with our registration and did an excellent job! 5 stars in my book!!!
5	I was contacted today by customer service, Tomas Jurik. Since I most probably had written wrong e-mail adress, he reminded me of that I did not receive any confirmation mail for my travel today. I really appreciated this. Thank you so much Mr Jurik!Br and thanks again,Karin
5	I spoke with Ana yesterday because my flight numbers did not print on my eticket forms, and I was beginning to be anxious about several related issues. Despite a great deal of background audio noise, Ana helped me to feel comfortable and answered my questions. She was extremely patient during our conversation. Thank you!
5	Shes very attentive in answering my concern. Thank you so much.
1	I agree, never ever buy a ticket from Kiwi or Skybooker!I'm extremely disappointed in your services and lack of contentiousness regarding our travel which we booked through your website.We paid for extra baggage (1 large suit case) for  what skypicker said was relevant to all legs of our trip. This prepayment for baggage was not recognized by Aegean Air resulting in an extra cost of 40 USD at Ben Gurion airport on our way from Tel Aviv to Rome (via Athens).Then, when we arrived at CIA to go from Rome to Paphos via Ryan Air, we had to pay 90 Euro for not having tickets before we checked in. Skypicker neglected to check us in as stated you would in your documents or send us our tickets on July 1st as stated you would. And you also didn't provide us with the information necessary to check in on our own - you used a skypicker email address to register for the flights instead of my email address, there is no way we could have known this information.Lastly on our way back from Cyprus to Tel Aviv on Aegean Air we again had to pay for baggage resulting in an additional 40 Euro charge.Skypicker's inadequate level of customer service and lack of care for providing us with necessary information/tickets caused us much stress and resulted in incurring charges while under duress at the airport. At an absolute minimum, we expect to be reimbursed for all the expenses incurred (40 USD + 130 Euro) immediately. If you would like us to ever consider booking flights with your negligent company again, we expect additional compensation for the damages your company has caused.Your level of customer service is abysmal at best.
5	Excellent service and attention, mrs. Jolana D. was very kind and helpful
5	I didn't recive my confirmation email cause I forgot a letter in it. I wrote here for help and Kristina helped me in a matter of seconds. She was so helpful and I got my email with 5 min. Thank you!
4	Clearly you'll are celebrating at the cost of the scams you'll run on the name of an organisation!
5	I got help straight away when I asked for help to do a late check-in online. Very grateful for the swift service. Forgot to say Emre T, helped me straight away. Much obliged!
4	I had a lot of bad luck on Christmas Eve as my flight home got cancelled. Dorota Žigová from Kiwi helped me find another flight really quickly and took care of everything. She also fixed an error that was made during the booking that made my checked baggage not show up at the airport check in. Thanks Dorota!! :)
5	@skypickercom Thanks for the list add. Happy holidays!
5	I had some plans change and I needed to drop the first leg of my flights and request a refund. Aliz was the rep i spoke with and she was personable, knowledgeable, and she resolved everything in a few minutes. If all service was like this the world would be a magical place.
1	I bought travel insurance via AXA/Kiwi prior to going to Australia.(26 pages of double speak legalese language btw) Our Jetstar flight was delayed at first in Melbourne, then cancelled and rebooked to Sydney therefore we had to reschedule our connecting flights from Honolulu to Hilo; these were non refundable tickets, thus we had purchase three tickets for our connection - twice. Thus, we have flight insurance, and submitted our claims after collecting all our receipts and evidence, Some pharmacy PhD person, whose first language was not English, denied our claim saying we did not have the Plus insurance, yet right next to it was the Basic insurance which shows their indemnity towards our claim and showed that our claim was <http://valid.It|valid.It> was like it was a new experience for them processing a claim.  Another series of confusing e mails followed from Kiwi and continuing denying our travel insurance claim. Now I have to contact our Consumer Protection Agency to file a complaint. So much for travel insurance from this company!! I'm a doctor and I deal with insurance companies all the time.
5	Alexey Tudakov - very effective and fast service! I appreciate the help and I look forward to my flight!  Thank you again!
5	Travel Consultant David Germ respond and helped me extremely fast to correct my ticket wich I at first managed to fill out wrong. And this at no cost at all. Thank you very much.Stefan Ståhl Sweden
5	I do not usually take the time to leave a review but on this occasion I feel as though I must. On the 19/12/2016 I needed to book a return flight from Bali to Sydney. I was in a terrible situation at Melbourne airport where I could not board my flight to Bali without a return flight. I had an hour to get a flight booked! This was a very stressful situation to be in. I quickly looked for a flight on Skyscanner (the only site I use to book flights). I booked and paid for a flight through <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com>. I received an email booking confirmation that this could take up to 4 hours to process and confirm. I didn't have time as I was already waiting to board an outward flight! I called the customer service number to try and speed up the process. I was put through to a lovely man called Lukas Janecka who was extremely helpful. He was understanding and managed to get the flight confirmed within minutes. I was so pleased that I could finally relax. A huge thank you to Lukas. You are a credit to this company. Kind regards,Miss K Griffin
5	Very quick and helpful - I hadn't filled in my passport info before the deadline, Lukas fixed it for me :)
5	Just a few hours after my booking GDL-IAH (Volaris) and IAH-TPA (Sprit), I had to cancel the entire journey, for painful reasons on my side.I contacted Kiwi by Email and phone the same day (They offer Austrian Helpdesk number!), taking into account that my Mastercard payment might be probably lost in case of my full cancellation.Both the phone support and the later sequence of Emails was highly customer oriented, almost cordially - and really fast!They confirmed my cancellation, and will refund my payment within the next weeks. Just a tiny handling fee will be kept-in. Thats no problem!I do not remember the helpdesk person name, I was attended by two or three ladies (phone Lady, Kristina B, and Michaela S) All thumbs up!Thank you Kiwi
1	DONT USE THIS SITE. I payed for flights with luggage, but win the booking was done. They didn't add luggage to one of the flights. They apologized and told me to send them a receipt and they will refund. I did as they told me, and i got a refund of 5 euros, the luggage addition on the airport cost me more then 50 euros. which was their fault in the first place.
5	War meine erste Buchung mit Skypicker und ich bin vollauf zufrieden! Der support reagiert direkt und man erreicht sie 24 Stunden, / Tage die Woche! Werde auf jeden Fall wieder hier buchen. Weiter so Leute...
5	I just wanted to brag on one of the travel consultants, Jame Tickner. My flight had been delayed with another airline, and he was so good about helping me figure out what I needed to do. The prices were extremely reasonable, and James had it all done in less than 30 minutes. I will definitely book with Kiwi again!
5	Excellent service, operators are very responsive and quick answered to my question. I  would like to mention Alice W for her very good work 5 stars ++
5	Very accessible and easy to deal with. Flight times changed and I was promptly advised and alternative times wee booked with ease. Thanks Aora for your help and patience!
5	I fly often in SE asia.  Many of the local airlines (Cebu Pacific, Air Asia, Air Philippines...) have websites that are so bad I think the violate the Geneva conventions.  Honestly, the people who have built these sites should be drug out into the middle of the street and shot in the face.  They are awful.Now, whomever designed <http://KIWI.COM|KIWI.COM> should be flown out to Bali, and then given a 48 hour long erotic massage by a team of lithe, limber, and highly dedicated Hindu goddesses.  (Or gods, or both!  I don't judge.)  The web site is that easy to use.  You just select your flight, put int your information, and Voila!  Tickets are in your email box.I wanted to make a small change to my ticket.  If I purchased it through the airline, trying to make a little change (even if it is something as small as correcting the spelling of a name on a ticket) is about as fun as operating on your own appendix.   Jan Lukasek was so very kind and patient with me, and waded through all the muck the airlines had to offer in order to get me the ticket I wanted, and at a rock bottom price.I'm so happy.  I'm naming my firstborn son, Kiwi Dot Com.  I'm naming my first born daughter, Janiqua, Vanquisher of Local Budget Airlines.   I'm getting a tattoo of <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> on my butt.  And I promise you, I have one fine butt so that is prime real estate.For easy of use, and quality customer service, I highly recommend <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com>
5	Customer service was really helpful. Jakub was really patient and helped me solved my problem, great work.
1	This is the first time I booked a trip with Kiwi and I was so sure I would be back but after what I went through trying to cancel the purchase, I can only recommend people to stay away from this company.I called within 24 hours after purchasing the ticket to cancel it, at first they told me I have to call each connecting airline separately to try and get a refund. Then they sent me an email saying they contacted the airlines themselves and they are offering me 59.90 EUR for the amount I paid which is 920.2 CAD. I understand and am prepared to pay a penalty but this amount offered is a joke. Both the customer service agent and the manager sounded like they were reading from a script infront of them. I am VERY DISAPPOINTED.
5	It was everything very simple... all the process, reservation, payment, check in. I have no complains and everybody in my family, that traveled with me, was very satisfied.
5	Excellent experience. Easy booking and great price!
5	I did a stupid mistake with the booking, but Kira was very kind to contact ryanair and get information to have a tax refund for my wrong flight.She was fast as a thunder to call me back with all the available options.
4	I was highly satisfied with the service of Skypicker. Everything worked out very well. I booked flights from Vienna to Heathrow in order to get to Reykjavik and then a week later from Reykjavik via Stockholm to Istanbul and back from Istanbul to Vienna. At first I was afraid to have too little time to catch my connecting flight at Heathrow, since it is a rather big airport (2 h 5 min to change terminals), but it worked out well in the end. I compared serveral different options and found out that Skypicker could offer me the cheapest possibility of all, so I can definitley recommend the service.
5	I am writing to gratefully thank your company and in particular  to Iurii N. for the excellent service and efficient feedback. It makes a very pleasant have to deal with such a professional company whose staff  have a genuine duty of care to its clients.
5	Fantastic customer service second to none well done Kiwi!!!
3	Hi sir/madam im Ms. Fremie Salisipan. I want to make my extra luggage 30kilos. This is my booking number. 316275. U can sending me an email. amg65-490@hotmail. com.
5	INCREDIBLE MAN, VERY PATIENT, AND ALWAYS HELPFUL.  IN SPITE OF ALL THE PROBLEMS WITH MY TICKETS AND MY DEBIT CARD, LEONARDO TOOK ALL THE NECESSARY TIME TO DEAL WITH MY ISSUES. A+++++
5	Tickets to the right price, very good help when wished to add services, and smooth handling all the way. Very happy with the services.
5	I definitely recommande Skypicker. At the beginning I was a little bit scared because I didn't know this compagny before. But good surprise. It Is was cheap, They answer to your email very quickly And there Is No problem at all with the reservation. And the best thing, I know it's a coïncidence but for my 2 flights I had 3 seats for myself. Thank you Skypicker
3	Skypicker Valentine’s promo: €10 off coupon for flights! <https://t.co/JWOdiulX60>
5	Mohamed hatte mich dieses mal geholfen und war genau so wie die anderen mitarbeiter super bei den helfen und beratun, ich bin wirklich Froh , dass die mir geholfen haben egal oder es per chat war, haupsache geholfenMOHAMED vielen Dank für deine Hilfe und ich werde an deinen geburtstag denken an den Tag meine reisehehehehe
5	I did book the flight ticket for 3 passengers on <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>. When I fill in the name area, I forget to fill the middle name and execute booking button. After I realized the lack of the middle name in e-ticket. I called the support number and describe my problem. They respond enthusiastically. My problem was solved within 24 hours. I am really satisfied with their service. I will keep using kiwi as the first priority to search and book the flight in the next times.
4	Kira was very helpful- really appreciate a good customer service
1	I was flying from Tokyo to Kolkata with layovers in Bangkok and Kuala Lumpur. Kiwi booked my flights under separate reservations. This means that I have to get out of the international arrival terminals at every stop and then get into the departure terminals. If a reservation has 3 different reservation at each leg why the heck I need a travel agent for? I can book those myself from the airline websites separately! I had to get on arrival VISAs for Bangkok and Kuala Lumpur to get to the departing flight! The whole time I was running and freaked out! Think about getting an on arrival Visa when your connecting flight departs in less than an hour. Not to mention pay more than 300$ for the Visa fees!!!!! NEVER EVER book flights with this agent!!
5	Thanks Sergii M. for checking allowed bag size and weight with all the airlines in our itinerary. Overall positive experience from using <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>. Will definitely deal with them again.
5	I was helped by Ruslana K. Who was fantastic she was very helpful and understanding and out of all the support team I have spoken to by far highly outranked the rest!Thankyou so much for all your help!
5	The service was excellent.
5	The email about our flight change went to my spam folder, so we had no idea that our whole itinerary would be thrown off until we noticed that the times on our boarding passes didnt match our itinerary. I chatted online with someone from <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> and they were super helpful and the whole matter was cleared up in an hour! They found us an alternative flight. Maybe <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> should consider changer their outgoing mail name to match that of the initial reservation confirmation?
5	I had so many doubts but thanks to Jan Lukasek, they were all solved! Thank you so much for your time and patience :)
5	Customer service was great, answered all my questions, helped me with my tickets, will travel with them again!
5	i just want to give thanks to Radek that works at <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> 24/7 help line call center for the help that he gave me to understand all what i need to know about my flyght tickets. he was very helpfull, friendly and pacient once that was my firt time buying tickets online and my english is not the best. thanks Radek thanks kiwi
5	So far so good! I've been borderline-shocked by how responsive they are! They set up flights for me from Denver to Calgary and back, and did it for about $200 less than anybody else.  My trip starts tomorrow, so that will begin the true test of all the tickets and online check-in (which they do for you), and hopefully it's all accurate and I actually have a seat on the plane!
5	great,but greater is the customer service Neil,who was very nice an kind and helped me with my first flight ;)
5	Today i booked severals flights with <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> and i did a mistake while making the reservation. I called the center and didn't have to wait long before Adam.T answered. He was very helpful and handle my situation as quick as possible. Later during the day everything was fixed by the staff and Zdenka B was kind enough to see with and assure that nothing was charged in extra and helped me to figure the situation. I recommend <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>, it's rare to have this service and if you have to deal with Adam.T or  Zdenka B i'm positive that will be satisfied.
5	Really impressed with service provided with <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> , they did everything. Checked us in & emailed me boarding passes. Was great not having the hassle of doing this , especially on return flight. Thoroughly recommend to everyone.
5	Samael was great support @Kiwi. Answer all me questions, speak me language also. I am satisfied with support and service.
5	Dear Sirs,I want to thank you for the quick responses and pleasant communication with Eleonora Congiu and Pedro Folgado.The problem with changing the name on the airplane ticket was resolved in a very quick period of time.It was a pleasure to communicate with you.Kind regards,Ivana
5	The customer service is very good. I have contacted them several times (today I was chatting with Daniela) and always received friendly and effective assistance. Good experience!
5	I would recommend this company because of the hard work at a difficult and scary time for me.  I would like to extend my gratitude to Ms. Petra Musilova for going above and beyond for helping me and my family. I've booked my tickets online without paying no attention to baggage. My sister Isla law was at the airport and was refused to be boarded because she had no money to pay the fees. I've contacted an agent online and was very lucky to be matched with Ms. Musilova. She was extremely professional and nice and did more then she was asked. I wish I can do more to thank her for staying with me thro this difficult, scary and urgent time with me. Thank you!
5	Thank you to Mario Zarsky for helping with our boarding passes!
5	It was the first time I used Skypicker, I got a cheap indirect flight, with a combination of flights no other website gave me as an option. Customer service was clear, helpful and super fast. Will definitely be using Skypicker again and recommend it to anyone.
5	I was able to get the best bet across various flight bookings offered online. Customer support with live chat is excellent. Really happy! Go for it :blush::+1::skin-tone-3:
5	Adrian was extremely helpful yesterday in helping me with my booking and any questions I had. Amazing customer service!
5	Site très facile d'utilisation, et l'aide en ligne est top ! Merci à Jonathan pour son aide.
4	Even that I just booked and cancelled a flight, the Service and especially the call by Mr. Kiian, to receive a optimal refund was beneicial, what I missed was a Description of the cancelation procedure in the FAQ.But perhaps is did not find them.Next time I seek a flight <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> seems to be a good choice.
4	I've had some struggles traveling but the support has always been good both via chat and call. During earlier bookings there were a few issues but for this topic it has been good support to get me to my destination even though a lot of delays.
4	Providing your customers via live chat and receiving clear information, which I didn't find myself via my booking information (I booked a domestic flight in India) was an absolute relief! Thank you, Hana! Will definitely get back to you, when needed!
5	I received very courteous and professional assistance from Karen. She's the best!
5	Eric gave me big confidense! Sow calm and so Nice..love him :kissing_closed_eyes:
5	I have fly till now with different companies , but skypicker is the best. They have the best service in travel , very easy to book , it s cheap and comfortable and the most important a great team that will help you with any problem you'll have ! Thank you for all and  I wish you good luck ! :clap::skin-tone-3::clap::skin-tone-3::clap::skin-tone-3::clap::skin-tone-3::top:
4	Great customer service, quick and reliable. I talked with Adam Jelinek and he solved my troubles quickly and kindly.
5	This was my first time booking with skypicker, and definitely not my last.  The service was quick and the process was easy.  From the day I booked, I received speedy results which continues to make my travel experience relatively easy.   I had a few questions regarding my booking and boarding pass and I was able to chat with an online agent, Martin Carter, who assisted me and put the last of my worries to ease! Thanks again to the skypicker team!
5	I have used skypicker\kiwi only once and i had a couple of problems but they were all my fault so I had to use the instant chat and to call to fix them, the staff has always been very polite and helpful and they always solved my problem as fast as possible, last time just happened now when Ali has been so nice and attended to my problem in a very efficient way :) thank you again for your help
5	very quick response on email inquiries and good support(one person, Natalya, even went extramile to reply to my initial email which was in Romanian by translating it first to understand the issue and then replying both EN and RO)
2	Before you book the flights with Kiwi makes sure you understand the following:1. Your connections may end with non code share airlines.2. You may have to get the checked in baggage prior to every connection, walk out of the security and customs to checkin the baggage again with the next connecting flight and walk back in to the gate after crossing the security.3. You might end up with the airlines which just allow 1 cabin bag and nothing else, not even laptop bag.4. Keep your stopover time enough as you might end up catching your next connecting flight from some other terminal.
5	I want to thank Katerina G. for her help with my flight problem. I did not expect I can click on chat icon and to get urgent help in a few seconds. I have very good feeling now. Thank you :)
5	Excellent service and very agile live chat I had with the Sena Adviser, very good care. I understood, despite my poor English.Excelente servicio y muy agil el Chat en vivo que sostuve con la Asesora Sena, muy buena atención.  Me entendió, a pesar de mi inglés pobre. Thanks Sena!!!
5	I had to change ticket, Skpicker made a good research with little fee difference arranged another ticket. I am really happy about services. Hoping to have a safe flight!
1	To beginn with they dont tell you terminals and flight numbers untill last minute.. That makes it hard if you don't constantly have internet.To have 2 h at an airport and realise you have to check out, change terminals and recheck the luggage between EVERY flight is not fun.We therefore missed a flight witch resulted in two nights on airport floors and a crappy replacement flight. They offered to pay 50£ (sumbolic sum trying to stay close to the airport) for a hotel but there were no available hotels anywhere close to the airport.Next flight, one of our flights were 4 h deleyed, atleast according to Google and the airline. But there was no way of getting in touch with Kiwi to confirm..The chat kept saying they would answer as soon as they could....At last they said it MIGHT be 24 min late and gave us lots of weird times.I'll probebly never book be <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> again.
5	My experience with agent Bogdan was very effective efficient and helpful. Just within  a few seconds when I started the conversation realized that the agent was willing to help and met all standards necessarily to perform his task. Indeed I will highly recommend Bogdan to friends,colleges or honestly to anyone who  needs costumer services with the company  .Thank you again and hope to see again in near future.
5	I would like to thank Babak that helped me today and another of your supporters that helped me yesterday (I'm sorry not to remember his name).Both of them very kind and proffetional ...All what a customer needs...and the impression is that a bleesed company stands behind them.....Thank youPaula
5	it was good and efficient
4	Great speedy service and Puput was a great help using the websites chat messenger service, and I was very surprised that this was available on a Sunday evening! The true meaning of 24/7.One thing I would say is it took about 20-30mins to get connected so I give 4 stars but that may even still be harsh considering the time and day.Definitely my new preferred booking service.
5	I spoke with a customer representative David and he was very polite and courteous throughout the conversation. Due to work obligations, I had to cancel my flight reservation and David patiently helped me understand that it is up to the airline to decide what the refund amount would be and that I would receive an email soon about the details of the refund. The process was easy and painless. Great customer service!
1	skypicker is the worst. my passport was stollen and they want to charge me $600usd to 'change' my flight.... i am highly unsatisfied with Skypicker's disreputable services
5	Firstly, I want to say thank you to Katerina G. After Service is awesome. If I speak english better, I will write a lot of paragraph to appreciate for the help. Thank you again all the way from korea
5	Skypicker is amazing! Chat service is great. Anytime I need some support, agents are always very helpful! Thanks agent Irina for helping us this time :)
1	my review was not seen. so i review again.I made a reservatiom for tickets at € 1,306(we are big family-8 person).And i changed the date of flight. They had me to pay €1,542.I thought that the difference(€236= €1,542-€1,306) is extra charges.But they say ' due to our non-refundable policy, it is not possible to refund the money for the original ticket'so they had me to pay total  €2,848.it's not cancellation, it's just change!If i buy new tickets, it is cost just  € 1,306(it is less than  €1,542)And there isn't detailed description of that on skypicker's websiteI bought two company's ticket.(ryanair,  vueling)so i research ryanair,  vueling's website.they explain 'Change your flight for just €45 per passenger each way).'Two company have no policy about forfeit of first flight fee at the change of flight. just it need extre charge.( €45)I complaind about that, amd skypicker mailed me 'We have contacted with Ryanair and Vueling airlines and unfortunately, as we already informed you it is not possible to get a refund from them as they have non-refundable policy as we do.'it's true? i don't believe. it's just change of flight date, but skypicker had me to pay excessive amount-€1,542.what can i do? it's our family first trip. it's terrible.i mailed to skypicker and they reply to me as below.'In your case especially we were not able to change your flight from Barcelona to Seville, because the airline did not allow us to do so as it was a domestic flight. We had to buy completely new ticket for you and your family to get you to the final destination on time you paid for.Also we were unable to explain you this before because you paid for the change via Manage My Booking and the request was sent to us automatically. Then we just proceed it as you requested and there was no misconduct from our side. We booked the flight for the date you wanted.'i never want to cancel first flight tickets and buy new ticket. it's not change. and i didn't do it. i want to just to change.skypicker mean, they were not able to chang, and they should canceled my first flight ticket, and bought new flight tickets,they should be explain to me ahead.in the course to change the date of flight on skypicker's website, i didn't offer that explanation.i want to just change of date of flight, not newbuying. if change not able, they should explain to me. and they should have received my approval. It is definitely their fault. but they  blame me.
5	Really good prices and simple procedure on the website.Thank you for the prompt reaction of the customer service.Mrs Eva Sloukova, answered to my question directly (just 10 minutes after i sent my email). Her answer was really in detail, with professionalism and politeness.Thank you Skypicker and see you in my next flight booking!
4	"Zdenka was very helpful and patient! Her English is also strong, and she knows some common vernacular, like ""awesome,"" that made me feel especially comfortable. She made sure I was taken care of, and that I felt that way. I now trust Kiwi because of her."
5	I got the best service from jolana d and dmitriy d so well done you guys
5	I contacted customer service several times during my trip due a delay that caused a missed flight, a flight cancellation to get my options, and then finally to get a refund for the cancelled flight. Everyone was very professional, polite and helpful, and when I had to rebook a flight I missed they acted fast and called me back at the hotel to give me my options and assure my approval. I don't remember everyone's name, but I talked to Filip to get a refund, and he was very helpful and quickly referred me to the application form online. It was very easy to fill and gave me several options for methods of repayment.I would book a trip with them again any time.
5	Very easy to book round journey and all tickets and fares. Mostly satisfied with customer service as all agents (Markéta, Anastasia and Miroslav) did their best to help through online chat and email conversations. All of them were incredibly helpful and polite! Once again, thank you very much :-)
5	I had an amazing operator by my side and she give me all the priority because we were running out of time and she made it in less then 1 hour. So grateful to fine here on the chat online. Her nam is Polina M.
5	Excellent service - The was  problem solved right away. Very good job from this polite assistant. Thank you :)
5	It was very very helpful. Samael was very kind and attentive. It's the first time that I book with Kiwi and it was amazing. Thank you.
5	Very happy with customer service. Valentine was very patient and kind looking for changes in my booking.Thanks
5	Twice now i have had issues with flights. Both times, although no fault on Kiwi's part they have been quick and effective at resolving these issues so that i suffered minimum inconvenience. I would like to thank Niel personally for doing such a good job. It's nice to feel that you're talking to a human being and not some automated messenger like some travel websites provide. I will definitely book with Kiwi again and would happily recommend them in future.
4	I wasn't sure that my payment for flight tickets passed tru, but Dorota assisted me promptly solved the problem.Ronald galea
5	I had booked a multi stopover flight with <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> and ran into a smal problem with not being able to get a boarding pass in the download link.So contacted the provided phone number for help and Roman was the booking Agent attendin my enquiry.After a drop in internet i was disconnected and having forseen this possiblity i had asked to be calked back, should this occur.And it did.Roman called me back, we talked about the misding boarding pass and after a few attempts and another call back to my moblie the issue was resoved in a curtois and proffessional manner.Well done Roman and thank you for all your help.I would not hesitate to recommend making a future booking with <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>The booking was quick, easy and confirmation of flights came in within a short period of time.Any problems you get the support that I rarly experienced elsewhere, not even with local travel agents at times.So i give this Company a big thumbs up!Well done Roman:clap::clap:
5	I had a great experience talking to Jan, Jakub and especially Klara, who answered to my request and did the job beautifully.
5	Anh was helpful in the livechat answering questions.
5	My reservation was really easy, with a very good price and a pretty low fees.
5	Ran into a lastminute with my checkin on Ryanair that I bought via the website. Was afraid that I was not going to get my boarding pass for various reasons. I was on chat with Stasy from Skypicker. The chat connection broke. Shortly after Stasy called me. She was very thorugh and detailed in here explanation and care. Everything was sorted in promptly and in a good manner. Always good to deal with a company that tries to their utmost when a problem arises. I use the site to find ultra cheap flights across Europe and will continue to do so.
1	I book flights frequently through the sky scanner app. I had to book an emergency flight for my brother to fly first thing the next morning from Auckland to Sydney so the app advised that <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> was the cheapest.  Even though I had never heard of it before I assumed it was a NZ based co so I went with it.  My money was taken from my account and I thought everything was OK.... It was not.   I received an email stating that I should get my itinerary within 240 mins.  An hour later I received an email stating that there was a 'minor delay' with booking and that they'd get back to me.  4 hours after I paid for the flight I called the NZ phone number to realise that it was diverted to some other country.  I explained my situation and that I still hadn't received my tickets so the girl stated that they would investigate and call back within 2 hours.  I expressed that the flight was in 10 hours and that I needed to know what was happening asap.  Half an hour later I got an email stating that they were unable to book the flight and that my money would be refunded within 10 days.   I immediately called the co back stating that I didn't want a refund and that I just needed a flight! I was then told that they would investigate and give me a call back within 2 hours! As you can imagine, time was creeping up and i needed this flight asap so I asked to speak to a manager.   She then proceeded to tell me that they would investigate and call back in 2 hours.  By then it was late at night and I just wanted to get to bed but I couldn't as I needed to book this flight. I finally got a call at around 10pm stating that they had a flight with a different airline (Virgin) but half an hour later, which was fine with me.   However I expressed that I originally booked and paid for a flight that had a meal provided, in flight entertainment etc and that this new airline was a low budget one and didn't have any of this included.   I was told that they would investigate it and then get back to me.  Then about an hour later I FINALLY received my email stating that the flight with virgin was booked, however the itinerary still had information about the old airline I was meant to be booked with.  So I had to get on the phone again and told them about the confusing information and half an hour later I received the correct itinerary with the correct information, however they still didn't have any information about the added extras that I was missing out on.  Finally got an email at 12.17am stating that for a meal, I would need to purchase a meal, save the receipt and then have our money refunded.   However by the time I got this in the morning, it was too late to let my brother know before he jumped on his flight.So basically, the whole booking process took 8 hours to rectify + I paid for a flight with all the added extras and I ended up getting a budget airline with no mention of being compensated for the total downgrade.   I've never used <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> before and I never will and I will make sure that no one in my network use it either.
1	Booking with Skypicker online was not bad. However the details of my flight were unclear after I paid for the flight.  I had two stops going and one direct flight returning. The issue is that the flight times in my opinion were unclear.  I arrived for my return flight at 2 pm instead of 2am!!!! I would not have purchased the tickets if I had known the return flight was to depart at 2 am. I called Skypicker,  and told them I had travel insurance  bc the airport in Hong Kong had me purchase another return ticket for 561 USD. This was more than my original ticket and I need to recoup some money. The travel insurance company is in the Czech Republic! I emailed them,  called then and they hung up on me.  I also called my bank to dispute these charges.  I want my money back from that return flight.
5	thanks the face book message  answer me and help me very quick.
4	Ondrej ('Andrew) helped me solve my problem, of paying for a piece of checked baggage that I signed up for today. He explained things simply and clearly. He helped me consider different options when the first things didn't work. He 'thought outside the box', and eventually the problem was solved easily. He persevered and was courteous to me. I thank KIWI and Andrew for your help. This is another plus for going with KIWI.
5	First time to use Skypicker I thought it was too good to be true when I found the flights I wanted at an incredible price. Booked, got immediate confirmation and then subsequent emails gave me updates on boarding passes etc. Overall extremely pleased with the service, will absolutely be using every time I travel and will be recommending to all my friends.
5	I ask for help several times in the online chat. However, the first few customer services did not help me successfully, they ask me to send my information via email to customer service email and did not told me that they did not receive my email. Until a week later i come and ask for help again, still asked me to send again because they did not receive my email. Then until one day later i still hear no reply. I use the online chat again and Natali solve the problem for me right away.I hope you can increase the efficiency of customer service so i don't need to ask for help that many times and wait for so long -- 2 weeks! I would like to rate you 1 star but Natali help me solve the problem and being very nice to me which change my mind.
4	Came across Kiwi online and decided to give it a try.  Needed a little help to add a paid carry-on option as the airline my flight was on charges for the extra bag and the standard Kiwi template doesn't offer that during the checkout.  Patrik was very helpful and I'm hoping the booking works out when my flight happens in a couple of weeks.  Fingers crossed...
5	Just wanted to say thank you to customer service rep Natalya P for her outstanding service she provided! She was very kind & patient in answering my many questions regarding rebooking my flight!Thanks again Natalya
5	Great customer service from Cintia, very helpful and quick to respond
5	Everything went smoothly. Nothing bad to say.
5	Your service is very great and seedy.Thank you. Youlim Son :)
5	Made a booking to Manchester from Dublin and got myself into a muddle over the booking I was lucky that was solved and made correct and for that I was pleased next time I will be more careful again Thank,s
5	I chat with them for a change i wanna  make and they were very helpfull. Dima was the person that i chated with and was very profeciuonal and fast, now ill wait for a call in the next two days.
5	Despite the difficulties I had with my flights (airline cancelled flight), Skypicker handled the problem! Thanks for your help guys...
5	After I've booked a flight ticket I had realised that I booked it at a wrong date (my fault), so I contacted the customer service team, hoping to solve this matter.Serhiy answered and listened my concern so he advise me to give him time to find out what would the prices be and the flights schedule, because my return should be in a couple of days and not in weeks like the one I booked by mistake. After less than half an hour, Serhiy managed to find a flight at a very good price, he was kind enough to help me with the online check procedure, and also Sherhiy even booked me a seat next to the window. What can be more beautiful than this.Therefore Sherhiy is a very easy going person to talk with, very polite and very friendly. You just made my day awesome mate. Will definetely use the service again.Thank you very much
5	Great service, Anita was very helpful and she and her colleagues responded very fast, every time .Thank you once again!
4	Everything is just fine. The staff are helpful and sincere. It's good enough as the price is such low.
5	Very good customer service...The representative Valery help me a lot

1	"Never use Skypicker. I am an Indian national and I recently booked a fligths for my husband and I back from Bali to Chennai on Skypicker. The flight I chose had a 1 hour stopover at Singapore. However, at the Bali airport, we were not allowed to board because we did not have a Singapore visa - even though we were only going to be in Singapore for an hour and were never leaving the airport. The fligth from Bali to Singapore had no visibility of our journey from Singapore to Chennai (which they would have if they were partner airlines) and couldn't let us board, even though we had a confirmed booking with them. We had to rebook our flight - pay a full fare last minute price and all we got from Skypicker was a nonchalant - ""you should have read the fine print response"".All the other websites we have used so far recommend flights which have partnerships such that international travelers do not need transit visa during short stopover, where they don't intend to leave the airport. Skypicker does no such thing. In today's age of intelligent systems, this is un pardonable. And having fine print as an excuse for doing a shoddy job is pathetic. They also have the worst customer service. When you are stranded at an international airport and are not allowed to board, the only response they have is ""we have fine print that you should have read"", even though what they have done is absolutely NOT standard practice. Of course they don't refund the money because in their fine print it says ""everything booked via skypicker is non refundable"". If you want hassle free travels - never use skypicker."
5	I had trouble figuring out how to add additional luggage, But with the live chat I was able to solve the problem really fast.Thay contacted the airlines for me and they provided all the details  I needed in seconds ( including a link  for me to pay )
5	Last week I had a chat with Mr. Archil and he helped make everything better.Thank you
5	Had a problem. Alan Whitfield promptly solved it. Underpromised / overdelivered.
5	Best prices, smooth transactions, 24/7 help line with very professional agents. I was helped by Filip.
5	I recently had a trip booked through Skypicker in Europe, that included 6 different flights from 2 different low cost airlines. A few days before my flight I contacted skypicker to try to change my initial baggage choice (on Ryanair). I talked with Mariya Potello, which was superful helpful - she really placed herself in my shoes, and try to find the best solution possible. It was my first booking with skypicker, but with this experience, I'll likely come back!

1	NEVER choose this company. NEVER. their customer service system is so bad.  i understand that though online service we can never get back to same person. i have talked to a lady online just when i finish my booking as one of friends might need visa for transfer flight. the lady tell me that she cannot help with visa but i can pay the difference to change the flight ( the fact is that you can change flight within 24 hour with Ryanair with no charge) . after we confirm the visa requirement we require to change the flight for friend. The amount that they provided is even higher than every website for the same flight. what is the purpose of changing flight ?!  i will just buy a cheaper flight from skyscanner...Will NEVER buy from this company again....
5	Simple flight selection process with diverse origin and destination possibilities. Follow up email updates and boarding passes proven to be reliable. Good way of combining flight sectors on budget airlines with a missed connection guarantee not available directly from the airlines.
5	Miroslava. Great.  Great service. Perfect timing. She could handle to cancel my flight and refund money, so i can get a cheaper flight.  Im very very satisfied.  Many thanks again to Miroslava, im definetively choosing your company again.
5	Best support system ever! I made a few mistakes and they correct it immediately. Special thanks to Luis S.!!
5	Spoke to your kind staff about my worries in relation to a boarding pass and Eoghan was kind enough to help me. I must say he was nothing but polite and very prompt in his responses.I will be jetting off very soon and I look forward to it! thank you Eoghan and Kiwi staff.
1	I called your company few minutes ago. Someone answered in a very polite elegant tone! He seemed to be so happy about his work and paid attention to details while answered my questions! I asked his name and I think it was James. I thank him from here bcs he deserves it!
5	Had no problems, and all the information was communicated and clear ahead of time.
5	Very Good service!
5	Patrik's assistance was superb.and very helpfullHis answers were clear and the information I received from him was very helpful.Thanks again!

5	It was great help and will use your service in the future
5	I have bookings through Skypicker. All the way through they have been very helpful. I mistakenly gave some incorrect information and a very helpful agent Young Hun Song fixed the problem with no fuss and very quickly. I am looking forward to the trip and hope it all goes a smoothly as it has done so far.
5	I travel a lot and always search my flight tickets through websites.Now that I found Skypicker I have it in the very top of my bookmarksand will search first of all (if not only) with it.Numerous choices, very cheap prices and the best of all,very quick, professional  and accurate service to what I needed.Thank you Skypicker.
4	It's good for getting cheap prices but not so much for an easy trip
5	It was wonderful experience, to compare the prices of different Air lines inOne window and having done that while booking also it was smooth experience.Though I had anxious moment as I was dong first time thru a multinational support team.But, it was excellent and I am definitely going to us it in future.All the Best.
5	I am treamendously satisfied with the service provided by you Sabina and you Angelika from Poland. You were so attentive and supportive as a team that I am truly amazed by your graceful help. It did all go ok in practice with my almost multi-transferable flight ;)
1	Spent two days trying to get tickets changed being bounce back and fourth. Finally got sick of their sillyness and emails that I went straight to the airline and death directly with them. Norway airlines were only able to change first two legs of my trip and they did it very quickly and cheap. They were extremely helpful, however this left me with the final leg New York to Tampa which at the time a whole new ticket was only 131.00 so I got back into it with sky pickers and their incompetent staff only to find myself again waiting on emails and call backs. After speaking with five different people including a supervisor I was told that for me to change my ticket would be 238.00.  Way more than a whole new ticket would have cost me. So now not only did they get the cost of the original ticket for me but now they wanted the price of 1 1/2 more tickets from me.... And of course there are no refunds so I'm just put all this extra money. Will never do business with them again I don't care if there prices are hundreds less it's not worth the head ache if God forbid another member of my family falls sick with cancer...
5	Thanks a lot, Tomas, for such a fast solving of my issue! Just asking his branch to pay him well!

5	Excellent service!My boyfriend had booked a ticket from Manila to Oslo, and his connecting flight from Manila to Hong Kong got cancelled mid air due to bad weather in Hong Kong. As he returned, we contacted Skypicker regarding this situation. Their worker Oksana presented us 2 options for 20th of April without any problem, despite these options being more expensive than the original ticket we bought.Only issue we had is that we didn't get to pick either of the 2 options(we thought about option 2 being better), but that was rather because the airliner of option 2 was closed at that time, something Kristyna explained well.Otherwise, we will definitely book more from this travel agency in the futureThank you so much, Kristyna and Oksana!
5	Thanks to Jouan Costa and his team at Skypickers making my trip to Dublin from Bergen smooth.. Event tough it was some technical problems on a flight that was out of anyone's control. Will easily pick them again.
1	I booked a flight from Rome, Italy, to Melbourne Australia on Saturday 27th August with stops in Moscow, Beijing and Kuala Lumpur. The booking online was easy to make and the flights were fine. The problem was that when I checked my bank account, I had been charged $788.22 twice for the same flight. I immediately contacted the company on support department of <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> and received a reply from Tomas Krivanek apologising for the mistake, and stating that his colleagues will be in touch with me within 12 hrs to arrange refunding of the second deduction from my account. Unfortunately,after 2 days without word from <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> regarding my complaint, I wrote back to the support department of <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> asking for urgent action in resolving my compliant and refunding my money as promised. 7 hours later I received a reply from Melinda Ivany, stating that the accounts department had refused to process my refund request as they were 'qite overloaded with refund requests at the moment', and that transfer may take up to 30 days. This is disgraceful business conduct and I have written politely back through the support department of <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> to demand immediate action on my claim, and that I will report their misconduct to the Australian  Competition and Consumer corporation, and that I will immediately dispute the transaction with visa. If <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> continues to conduct their business in such an immoral way, customers will quickly become aware that they are not a legitimate business and will shop elsewhere. Shame <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com>, shame!
5	We wanted to upgrade our baggage from from city to another and Julia helped us very professional at the chat. Thanks for professional and easy help. It only took 5 minutes! I can definitely recommend using KIWI as well as the chat-help function! :) Kind regards Christian
5	I can! :D
4	I was worried about the site because they don't allow you to check in with the airline, it is almost like they're buying the tickets under their name. But everything worked out! They send your boarding passes to your email so make sure you're watching your email the day before your flight. I only gave 4 stars because you don't know when your boarding pass will show up. I feel much more comfortable being able to check in on my own time & know that I have my ticket home. I didn't want to risk not being able to scan the electronic tickets (the customer service representative for my airline said they don't always work) so as soon as I arrived at the airport, I printed my tickets with their kiosk.
5	I hade some issues booking a ticket and Jiri Cervenka was a massive help for me and she helped me as well with other information regarding other flight...Thank you very much Jiri!
5	I was stupid enough to book my flight on a wrong date and had a couple of questions regarding the changes. I used the Live Chat facility and Jan politely and accurately clarified all my doubts. Thank you!I had to pay for the new tickets in full, but I never expected Kiwi to cover this - people who do should simply read the T&C's.
5	Filip was helpful and quick. All my questions were answered. Put my mind at ease.
5	customer service was friendly and helpful. I contacted customer service via chatting and Lorena helped me out with my problems.
5	"I called the company to confirm my booking payment and was very well attended by the attendant ""Shirley"""
5	Booked a flight from CPH-LTN and connecting flight from LTN-DUB with Skypicker.Easy, frictionless and with no issues.They checked me in automatically and sent me the boarding passes in my email. Nice little service.
5	Great experience, and the support is amazingchoose Skypicker
5	thanks to Oga for a fast resolution of our problem :)
5	I booked a flight on Kiwi and needed to change it immediately. I called, got Lucy, and in a situation where most airlines would have given me bad news about fees, she rushed to catch the booking before it had completed and saved the day. I've never encountered such a caring and efficient customer service response. I'm a kiwi customer now for life. Thank you Lucy!
4	Thank you Peter and Eugene for helping me sort out my booking details! Very good service!
5	Top Service we called German support number and got great assitance. The Lady i've spoken with was, competent, helpfull and friendly.
5	When making the flight booking with you I navigated through the drop down menu to find that the nationality of our passenger (Kosovo) was not indicated. I went direct to the rest of the form and the ticket and boarding pass was issued without problem.When our passenger checked in she was designated as a UK citizen.This caused major confusion and she was denied boarding the Ryanair flight. After much consultation with security, her Kosovo citizenship was recognised.As you can imagine,it was a vert traumatic experience for our colleague as she had a connecting flight from Bratislava. Luckily, she was able to send me a text and I connect to your representative called Lucy F who was of great help. To avoid future problems, would it be possible to include Kosovo on your application forms?Please let me know if you can achieve this.Thank you for you assistance in this matter.Ken Mc CueCultural PlannerInternational OfficeSport Against Racism IrelandMobile: 00353851056134
4	Booked two flights with One stop each and absolutely NO PROBLEM, ALL FINE!REACTIVE customer service through Fb Messanger
1	I was extremely disappointed with my Skypicker experience. I fly constantly for both work and personal and have never experienced such poor customer service. I booked a flight and within 2 hrs realized both the dates and location were incorrect. After contacting Skypicker they were unable to change the destination and essentially took my money without delivering a product. It ruined my ability to go on holiday this spring. I will NEVER do business with them again!
5	My friends and I (studying abroad) booked a weekend flight to Budapest quite a while ago with skypicker and yesterday we received a notification saying that our flight had been changed to the next day. We were very upset as that would have meant that we would have to miss our hotel that night and the tour we had paid for the next day. However, one of their agents Jonathan spent almost 2 hours on their chat with me trying to help us get where we needed to go. He was very patient and helpful! Then, another agent, Tomas Muzik, was able to book us a direct flight to Budapest at no extra cost! We will now get the the same day we had planned on arriving. We are so relieved and appreciative that they were very friendly and made sure to get us where we needed to go since our original flight was cancelled. Thanks very much, we are so excited to still be travelling to Budapest!
1	Really bad booking platform - no information and UX..............
5	I recently had a problem with my boarding pass  and jonathan from skypicker really help me hé was perfect, thanks a mil
5	THANK YOU ALL IS DONE
5	I have traveled with <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> the last summer, with very complex trip that included 4 flights with transfer, and since the first moment I have received really good attention by the company, specially throught the customer service always avaiable for whatever kind of doubt, and I want to recommend <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> for book your flight because is really confortable that they make the online check-in for you and the only thing you need to be aware is of check your mail a couple of hours before to board ;)
5	Lucas, Ala and Jiri were very helpful when my flight from St. Thomas to St. Croix was cancelled because of high winds. I missed my flight to europe because of that and had to stay one more night in St. Thomas. They found and booked me another flight to Europe the next day. Thanks kiwi support team!
5	Is easy. Thanks for martin carter
5	I don't have much experience with travelling by plane, but Skypicker really helped me to choose the right destination at the right time. It's really practical to use when deciding between different dates of travel to different locations, and you can really find cheap tickets.
1	Had the worst booking experience with Skypicker ... in 50 minutes phone conversation, they only kept repeating the terms and condition to ignore my request!! very angry at the moment.. thanks to SkypickerMaking sure that this will be my FIRST and LAST time NEVER NEVER NEVER EVER BOOK from this agency!!Due to skypicker's system crash down I mistakenly booked the flight in the wrong date and the payment was processed and I've contacted the customer service but they keep on insisting that they are just the MEDIATOR!!!!!
5	Thank you Skypicker!!! Tomas Muzic was extremely helpful in solving a problem with my ticket!! Awesome customer service :)
5	I just wanted to share a very good experience with the agent Lenka.
5	Thank you very much to Tomas U. I haven't booked yet, but have some concerns regarding the price and payment and Tomas answered all my questions extremely quickly. He was very nice and helpfull and explained me everything in details. Will definitely book my flight with Kiwi and rely on their cusomer support! Great job!
5	Great, quick, clear and very polite customer service via chat.
5	I emailed in a question today and was promptly helped by Anastasia and Francesco! I don't think I've ever been helped so quickly by email customer support like I was today. Thank you Skypicker!
5	I would like to thank a lot Daniele Livrieri and the staff of Skypicker for the great help provided caused by a 6 hours delay on my flight that made me miss the connection. He found me another connection for the day after and offered a refund for the night I had to spend in the hotel. Really really thank you!

5	I booked a flight for a client to one of our shows with a colleague's credit card. <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> asked me for further details, as they should, to confirm the booking but they said they would email the questions. However, I never received the email so I went on <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>'s chat function and asked for help. Petra M, was able to help me and in five minutes the whole security check was completed.
1	Just a farce! Wrong info. Wrong prices. I have had more than 20 writings to fix problems. Just  awful. I will not buy again, it spoils holidays having to do that
5	Agent Alan solved my problem in few minutes, really great job :)
5	I was having problem in access my e ticket. Mr.Eric patiently explained the procedure and also helped me in getting the e ticket. I wish him wellDr.A Basu
5	Quick and good service!
5	I had a problem with the check-in: since I had to Renew my ID card 2 days before the flight i wasn't able to check-in before the expiration date. I tried to contact Ryanair, the flight company I was going to travel with, but i did not received the help i needed, so i called the Kiwi support number. I found  a competent consultant, Roman Slobodyan,  who immediately  asked me all of the necessary information and soon resolved my problem. Without his help, i would had to pay an additonal 45 euros for each flight i booked, which is not an indifferent amount of money, since i have booked 4 flights. So thanks to Roman Slobodyan, thanks to <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>.
5	I phoned kiwi to clarify the check in procedure, and spoke to Eric who was extremely patient and helpful.
5	I spoke with one of the agents Talent P and she was very helpful in getting the minor error in DOB changed with the airline.  Talent P not only called the airline and had the corrected, she also called me and e-mailed me that hat the request has been resolved.  She'll also do the same thing for the return leg with another airline.This is wonderful customer service!  Thanks you!
5	I was using <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> for couple of times already. The experience is good until the moment you need to make changes in your reservation, or update invoice details. While usually it can take 5-7 days ( it happened to me to be more than that), Angelika was the person, who perfectly managed the task. She was clear and straight forward, and closed the ticket within couple of minutes. Really appreciated!
5	Flights cancelled on the day before new year's eve in Southampton Airport because of the fog, I was yet again thinking of going through another airline nightmare (no refunds, no help, no consideration..) and maybe thinking of spending my 2016-2017 new year's eve in an airport, and not in Stuttgart with my friends. With Flybe's thankful cooperation and Kateryna's huge help from Kiwi, I will be able to spend new year's eve as expected without paying any further charges than I already have and proves that justice does exist!In order to maintain this review purely objective, the only downside of all this is that I will arrive a day later than expected (but I can't blame them for this since they can't do anything about it).Kateryna was kind, patient and called me back a few times to make sure everything was sorted. I want to thank her and congratulate her for her professionalism. I want to thank Kiwi & Flybe for their flying policies as well. They understood what a customer needs in case of an unexpected event which what other travel agents (& airlines!) should follow!Well done! & Thank you!
5	I had some short delay with my boarding passes and the live chat discuss with one of the agents called David solved the problems for four different flights within 10 minutes and my boarding passes arrived on e-mail while the conversation. Great company with useful customer support!
1	This site is a fraud, kiwi experienced error on their web and mobile apps which happened to IDR and EURO only.1. The mobile apps shown 450 IDR but when the ticket is issued it changed to 450 EURO 2. For transactions in the web, the cc was charged only 1% of the price, here Kiwi claims there is nothings wrong with its system but the bank that handled the payment of their customers. and after ONLY emailed awareness to customer they immediately correct the on hold transaction even for over limit transactions. Bank informed that as long as merchant allowed, the card will do it which is Kiwi is aware this transaction might not be able to be paid by customersDO NOT BOOK in kiwidotcom till you are sure that you are charged correctly because Kiwi will not honour their errors and will blame the customers. #shamekiwidotcom #blokirkiwidotcom
3	@skypickercom hi please can u ask Eva from customer service  to give me a call- I have been waiting for a long time now
4	I want to give a huge applause and thank you to Travel Consultant Peter K. for doing everything possible to help me with making changes on the travel plan. I had quite a difficult case. I had booked flights for three persons but then something came up and we had to change the inbound destination and date for one of the passengers and the whole route and dates for two of them. Peter showed a lot of patience in a difficult situation and remained very polite during this two day process. Finally, two of the passengers chose not to fly at all (because the changes of the whole route and dates became pretty expensive) and one passenger was provided with a new inbound flight from the preferred location for a decent price. After all it all worked out for the best. What we learned is that always take the flight ticket insurance if possible for cases like this so you can return the ticket and save alot of sweat, blood and tears. Well no one shed any tears nor bled but you get the point. Thank you Peter K. one more time for the amazing customer service! :)
5	i booked a wrong ticket and quickly opened the live chat.i answered my details and my ticket was cancelled with full refund,as my booking was in processing.thanks to the quick action of the agent.
5	Tomas Sykora messaged me and gave me an early notice for my flight schedule change. He even gave his time searching for another schedule for the change in flight coincides with my flight from Vietnam to Manila. It was convenient and the early notice is greatly appreciated. Thank you and Happy New Year!
5	Lucia at kiwi thanks for everything, you rock the world ;)! Thanks for the help , had it not been for you , I had not managed everything ;)
5	Was really good. 5 hours before fly i had no boarding pass and live chat helped me to get it in few minutes. really efficent
5	To the travel agent: Jonathan Ronald Muller Eghan. You did a great job.. thanks alot
5	good and care :) thank youu <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com>
1	Terrible customer care. Do not reply mail. Can't provide invoice.
5	"I was using KIWI for the first time booking a flight ticket for a relative and mistakenly paid for the wrong dates. KIWI was very responsive and Monica (twice!!), Henri and especially Vitalii Nikitin gave quick comprehensive service and, although there was a higher fee due to the change, thankfully I did not lose out greatly.Do note that they give an opportunity to review the flight details before paying and clearly state ""no refunds"" (and I still missed that) but the agents were ALWAYS courteous, patient and respectful and truly helpful. The agents had great follow-through and even called me back to update me when changes were able to be made. I definitely recommend KIWI and recommend reading the fine print BEFORE clicking/paying!!!! Look for a follow up review at the end of November to rate the actual travel experience!"
4	first time was cut off. second time managed to find the information i needed. friendly. service provided by tomas. thanks.
5	I entered a bad email address. And agent Mario R. was so kind and helped me in few minutes. Thank you again.

3	How do I get my mobile boarding passes? I tried using the booking reference within the airline apps but it returns an error, I believe it's because I'm using my email instead of yours? I would like to avoid printing boarding passes.
5	Kristina was very eager to help me fill in my missing information and answered all my questions promptly
5	Grande Puput! The best!!
4	@skypickercom but i am sure you are cheating passengers. actually i have paid all amount on DEC 19 -2015 .

5	Had a small problem with boarding pass but anas dalla fixed it in no time first class many thanks  harry w.
5	I just wanted to let people know that I had a HUGE problem with Skypicker and booking a flight for my son, they wanted to charge me more than the ticket to put his name on the ticket correctly after it had come across with his middle name as his last name.  Skypicker worked diligently on our behalf and got the change done for free, very professional and accommodating.
4	"@AlyssaRamos One hurdle to reaching ""Best hot and cold destinations:"" airfare costs. Check ouy Skypicker to remedy  <https://t.co/QYnrvEvebG>"
1	"""I used <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> to buy airline tickets, and I admire more how well organized their web is; all the flight information and options are clearly presented and the interface is easy to use.I have a large family and we travel a lot. Christmas time is a time for family reunion and I bought 3 plane tickets and contacted customer support when needed. Your company earned my trust and respect through these transactions.On Sunday I tried to purchase another ticket for my daughter who is a student with very limited free time. Using your website I found a great flight, however when I tried to book this flight, your system would not let me do so and the cost of the ticket was increased 80%. Then your site gave me the option to select a different flight. I contacted customer support and Samuel answered. He responded that the airline company had changed the price, and helped me find another flight which had more connections and a higher price. There was only 1 hour between the connection flights, and I was concerned about whether this would be enough time to collect and recheck the luggage. The next day I open up your site and find that the flight that I had originally wanted to book, was available and the price was even lower. I contacted customer service again to cancel my booked flight. Miliana. K, travel consultant, said that she could cancel with the English airline, but not with the Baltic airline, and she requested time to work on this issue. Approximately 3hours after this I receive an email that this ticket is no longer refundable because 24hours has passed. I contacted customer service again and explained what had occurred, and was promised that a manager would deal with the situation. As of now,more than a day has past and nobody has contacted me to resolve this situation. """
1	"Kiwi (and only Kiwi) posted a very low fare for a particular route, 50% less of other agencies, which lured me into paying. However, they then refused to proceed the booking due to ""technical issues"". They promised a refund within 24 hours, but they never did so far, and they are still ""investigating"" the delay.I had to find a different agency to book my ticket, for which I ended up paying twice."
5	I was speaking with the agent Jan Lukasek, I wanted to cancel my reservation, nothing to do with the site, just a change of plan, and within 6 messages we were done and my problem is on the way to being fixed. I've spent over 100 minutes on the phone with another company, and all I had to do here was send a quick message in a live chat, and boom. Problem is on the way to being solved! Booking with them anytime!
5	Fast and efficient booking and help desk response time. Had an issue with a flight change and an operator named Yuriy resolved the issue on the spot.Will use skypicker again.
5	Thank Skypicker for quality service, search for optimal price and time of tickets, speed, timely flight information, enjoyable flight.
3	We have used kiwi/skypicker for our whole trip through Europe and everything has gone smoothly up until now. Our flight got changed to an earlier time and therefore we missed it because we didn't receive an email notifying us of this change. We had to buy a new flight for €931 because we missed our first one. We are hoping for a full refund as this is the companies mistake
1	I bought a ticket that said one stop flight  and it was a 2 different flights and I have to paid my baggage twice...
1	I booked some tickets on August, 2015.At first, they showed me Seoul to Osaka flight and Osaka to Seoul flight both included 15kg baggage in ticket price.So I booked that ticket through Skypicker and received e-ticket.E-ticket i received said that there are still free 15kg baggage.But when i called Jeju Airline and they said my flight(Osaka to Seoul) doesn't included 15kg baggage because that flight is a special promotion ticket. And Skypicker doesn't mention about this at all. So I have to pay 14Euro per 1kg on my trip on February!!!!!! THIS IS SO UNFAIR!!!!!!So I e-mailed to Skypicker and also sent my boucher that I've got from Jeju Airline to them but they just said i have to pay another extra charges and even i can't get a rerund!! WHAT HAPPENED??Still I have a little time to start my trip on February.So PLEASE SKYPICKER if you read this review, e-mail me and give me the best answer!!! I NEED IT IMMEDIATELY!!And if you consider to book a flight through Skypicker, THINK MORE.
5	When I made my reservation I got into problems because I payed twice and reserved twice. So I called to the emergencies phone and a Madam, called TAMARA, assisted me perfectly and solved all my problems. She was very proffesional and very kind.
3	@skypickercom booked a flight with a connecting flight both Ryanair, how do i online check in when it's time to do so?
3	When I cancelled my tickets, no one told me I had to fill in a refundform. Because of travelling Asia, I don't check my e-mail that often. I was kinda surprised to find my boardingpasses for my cancelled flight in my inbox even though I confirmed multiple times in the conversation that I wanted to cancel. I once again reached out through the livechat and had a nice and funny conversation with Nikola. Nikola was helpfull and also checked right away if I could get a refund. Thanks you for your info and help!
5	I had a question about meals for a flight, Tomas quickly responded helping find what I needed.
5	Thank you Enri A. for resolving my issue.  Online chat was simple and effective.
4	@KyveliR Thank you for your kind feedback and for choosing Skypicker. We would be pleased to handle Your any future trip.
1	UNRELIABLE.  They will attract you with a low price , TAKE A PAYMENT, and then cancel your booking unless you pay extra money arguing prices went up.  They use these fraudulent practices on a regular basis. STAY AWAY from KIWI
5	no troubles at all, quick and simple booking flow, all info emailed straight away
1	Since does not have that diamond, why also installs the power source?
5	I was online chat with Julia and she was extremely helpful and answered all my queries in relation to my flight. She helped get the extra luggage I asked for within minutes! Thank you so much Julia :)
5	The flight was very good. Nothing to complain. I recommend Skypicker!
1	"I booked flights for my 50th this coming DEC/Jan from Bangkok to Hanoi - Ho Chi Min/Singapore on kiwi com website. The price quoted online was in NZ dollars...(As I'm kiwi) total $644.97 When the payment came out on my credit card a couple of days later it was for $918.00!I went back online to check I hadn't used USD as a mistake knowing deep down I hadn't and sure enough I could book the same flights/times for the same money IN NZD! I rang Kiwi dot com to query this incorrect charge only to be ""conveniently"" told they couldn't sort it for me immediately, why I have no idea..surely they have a computer available?? Really??I received an email stating their ""IT"" dept checked on it and I had indeed booked in USD and ""sorry"" but you'll have to pay this ridiculous price. There is no evidence provided to me to back up their claims, no screen shot nothing. Its VERY easy for someone to make up stories to suit themselves. How many times have they fraudulently OVERCHARGED customers like this???I've since asked them to cancel the flights as I am going to book with a reliable company. Very disheartening experience and I warn people Not to use this company/service in fear of something similar happening to them!"
5	I would notably like to thank Kristina for being so helpful and accommodating my needs. Not only did she help me with my problem, but she gave me recommendations to where I should visit in Prague! Excellent Service!:)
5	Excellent service. I made a mistake on one of the names on my booking.  I would very much like to thank the team -  Dominika, Olena and Talent, for fixing this for me smoothly and quickly.
5	Very convenient, good prices with no extra add ons, works very fast. Plus great customer service from Alice W.
5	I've found kiwi-com via another Internet page (kayak-com), and then I've fully switched to Kiwi: they have more convenient interface and find better results with less effort (results present on Kiwi were absent from Kayak).Having made my reservation, I had to make a later change and the customer service has been very helpful – I've been in touch with a representative whose name was David.
5	I had a great experience with <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> when travelling from Colorado to Paris. I was a little bit scared because it was a long journey, 4 planes, and I didn't know how everything was going to work when collecting my luggage at the airport and having to do check-in again, etc. But everything was perfect. Long wait in New York, so enough time to collect lauggage. Then I was traveling New York - Rome - Milan with the same airline.. so the lauggage was documented all the way to Milan so I didn't have any problem. And in Milan I took an easy jet flight to Paris. It was a short wait at the airport but I already had my boarding pass that <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> sent right after I booked my flight and there is a vety convinient service at Milan airport (via Milano) to drop the lauggage for your connection right after collection. This made my connection really smooth and my overall experience great. I would highly recommend <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>. Just note tou have enough time for connections.
3	First off I accidentally booked a flight for the wrong date, and was informed it was non refundable. So I ended up purchasing another ticket to fly home the following day. (I will have too contCt the airline too see about refund since flight isn't for 2 weeks). So my new flight was delayed leaving Malaga to London gatwick and I ended up missing my flight and would of had to fly following day. But instead with the great help from Miroslava P, she was able to find me a better flight direct to my destination instead of 2 stops. Great work and helped me out big time. Thank you Miroslava P!!
3	We got nerveus because we still hadn't received our boardingpasses at 9 o'clock in the evening the night before our flight. But it was easy to get through to Skypicker and get it fixed.
5	We had some trouble with our online registration. Luckily, we used the online chat. We had great and fast help. Compliments to Aliaksandra. See our chat for more details.Kind Regards,Stan Croonen
4	I needed to make a last minute change to my booking, adding additional baggage. Henry at Skypicker made this extremely easy, providing very friendly and efficient service.
5	Kiwi's customer support (Michael) was very helpful to answer some questions under the bookingprocess.Afterwards, we had to change a passport number. Again the customer team (Puput) was very kindly to help us update the numers - without an ekstra fee!!We feel very secure buying our flight-tickes through <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> and would like to give <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> our warmest recommendations.
5	It was a first time I purchased flight tickets through kiwi, and was very surprised to find out that I couldn’t choose seats for my intercontinental flight online. At first kiwi agents were telling me that there was “some technical issue” and they were not sure whether they could help. Then luckily I was contacted by Nina Turkiyan, a kiwi agent, who promptly and professionally resolved the problem with seats and also assisted me with adding a vegetarian meal which for some reason was not possible to add online too. I am putting 5 stars for Nina’s assistance. Great service! She definitely deserves a reward from the company she is working for. As far as kiwi agency is concerned I would recommend them to add online option to choose and reserve seats and meal. It will be very convenient for all your customers and will take lots of weight off your agents’ shoulders.
5	Thanks to support service! I have solved my problem with manager Milica - it was fast, very proffesional and pleasant.
5	Our flight was cancelled by the airline because of runway problem. Kiwi re-booked us alternative flights without extra cost though the cancellation was nobody's fault. During those time, we were able to contact their customer service easily and they give fast response. They also do the online check-in and email boarding passes. Indeed excellent customer service and support! I highly recommend Kiwi.Thanks a lot,Emilyn
5	I had a problem with my boarding pass and when I opened the live chat I was connected with your agent called Monika. The service was perfect and she was very kind and excellent in her work.My problem was solved in lees than 5 minutes
5	Thanks Rodon, for the good service and helping me with my flight.
5	I had a lot of questions and concerns about my flights, because it is a company I didn't know before, but I got all the answers within only a few minutes. A nice man named Filip helped me. He was very plasent and professional. Helped me with everything I needed, and all the information. Thank you kiwi:)
5	Just had a chat conversation that went really good. Fast and efficient. Thanks :)
5	I was making my reservation in big hurry and I didn't realise that I will need my passport so I filled in my ID details. I contacted <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> immediately.Agent Dorota was very kind and she understood my problem. Her friendly and professional approach helped me solve the problem fast and without other problems. She saved my New Year's Eve holiday!I will definetely use them again!
5	I would like to say thank you Skypicker team for giving a best costumer service.  And spatial thanks to Igor how have been in touch with me few times in Emails, helped me to Book a flight in a short notice, always being kind and fast replays. I would like to keep working with you in the future too, Keep the good work ;-) Best regards
4	Very good service.. Just spoke to Pavlos Frederick on the phone, as there was a problem with my passportnumber. Problem fixed right away - and now ready to go :-)
5	Its à very good company Very  nice staff à recemend this  company very mutch
4	Decided to use the handy live chat service through <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> for some fast answers to general inquiries. Was extremely pleased with the service I received from Filip in Czech Republic. Convenient and easy to use! Now waiting for the actual flight to give a further review.Already telling people to use this website so I'm hoping everything goes smoothly with my flights !
1	"I thought I booked a ticket with <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> for my wife. They are the only ones who had the fare for specific airlines. About 15 min later receive an email asking to verify CC info since I am booking her ticket using my credit card. Sure, no problem. Called to UK, not toll free, paid for the call. They took all the info I provided, which matches all the info I input when booking a ticket. Waited another 15 min, get an email that transaction is declined since they could not verify CC. Sure, no problem. Call <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> support, in UK, not toll free still. Kiwi support says it can not book the ticket since my our last names are different. I ask what does that have to do with security verification? Guy mumbles, mumbles some more. I offer to call the bank together or have them call, but that is not an option. OK, sure let me speak to your supervisor. After 20 min on hold long distance, sup comes on. Can not do anything due to failed authorization. I ask what failed, he mumbles just like the other guy. I get tired of hearing BS since they do not even know why the transaction got declined. I ask if I rebook again with her CC will it go through? Turns out as long as it is booked with HER first and last name it will come up with ""fraud alert"" and cancel the transaction.... Be careful booking with them, not much ""support"" over on their end and no one really knows much. But prices are cheap and offer airlines I could not find on other search engines, wish they were a bit more professional and actually tried to make a happy client instead of declining for no reason."
3	@antondiaz What are your thoughts on discount flight finders like Skypicker? <https://t.co/KE0smolWul>
2	SAI: A startup that finds 'hidden' discount flight tickets just launched in the US <https://t.co/gZLMONMXbr> <https://t.co/XV7sL8ewS9>
5	Quick and efficient. Very professional. Thank you very much for your good services (last minute help in my case). All the best!
4	Thanks Aleksiandria(?!). Good communication and found a solution to my problem (didn't receive email with further flight details and online check-in).
5	Few hours before my flight I checked in online at Swiss air and saw on my boarding pass that there are no checked in luggage even though I ordered it through Skypicker. I spoke to skypicker online chat and they called Swiss air on my behalf to confirm that my checked in luggage is ordered!
5	I talk with Alan, a great and kind operator. All it's good.
5	After buying an airline, I tried to make several calls to Korea several times, but it was difficult to connect with the counselor.However, I used to live with Live Chat and received guidance from Radim.She was perfect and I felt better.I was so thankful that I came to believe in <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com>
5	I had spoken to Michaela regarding a misspelling on one of my group's boarding passes, not only was she extremely helpful, but she had made the process extremely transparent. Really grateful that she was on the other side of the line when I needed assistance.Thank you Michaela
5	Mario was a really good helper and he resolved all my doubts. Thanks again, I will definitely reserve more times with Skypicker
3	@crntlyexploring try it out mixing and matching budget airlines @skypickercom
5	Low prices, simple booking (don't have to register on the plane they send you tickets directly) and on time sending of tickets. I fully trust this company that I used already 4 times this year and enables to have lower prices on already cheap flights. Highly recommend to people who are looking  to save money on their travelling costs.
5	Had a chat with a friendly and talented agent named Radim. I did not come very well prepared to the chat but he solved all my problems really quick and with a nice un-robotic tone of voice.Radim is pro. Give him a raise!/A super happy costumer that will use Kiwi again :)
1	Ever made a schoolboy error when booking? Find out how Skypicker will help youAn expensive mistake. Given the information on your first communication timed at 15.29 in which you intimated that it would be 30 minutes to confirm my booking.Your next communication came at 15.31 followed by another at 15.33.I realised my error and notified you of the same at 15.36.What you are really telling me is that you do not want to refund my £98, not that you cannot.Your reason for not wanting to refund my money is and I quote 'Our flights are' well it is not your flight, you are a simple broker of tickets. The flight is 'Ryanairs'
5	The company and more importantly the young lady kira were exceptional in there dealing with my issue. The girl made my call very professional and also enjoyable she was a credit to your company thank you KIRA
5	Special Thanks to Jan Stepan,Diana and Erol Guliyev for taking special personal care about my problem and solving it very fast.Felix Nemirovsky
1	"I'm sorry. I can just give the company 1 star because of the bad politic and terms of condition. But I would like to give Natalya Petrushina my best recommendations. She really try to help me and she was very kind. I will say she is to good to work for this company! Give here higher Salary, she deserves that. She stay 40 min after work, just to help me. The last word "" Stop working together with Ryan air company"" specialy ENIKO P!!!!!Best regards to Natali from Tommi"
4	To be honest, I had a very bad view of <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com>.I had purchased tickets from Barcelona to Ibiza, and from Ibiza to Amsterdam in August when they were skypicker instead of kiwi. Later I found out there were just too many bad reviews out there, and if I had read them before I wouldn't have purchased the ticket from this company.However, despite what people say, my experience with them have been rather positive.For example, you may or may not know that Ryan Air costs you extra money at the airport if you don't check-in on their website beforehand and have your e-ticket printed out. Well, kiwi does it for you and sends it to you a week before - my trip is still upcoming so I will confirm if they do follow up on this promise. But my interaction with the support team, especially with Erol & Chan, have been very positive so I believe & hope that they will deliver on their promise. They also helped me with adding check-in luggage at a reasonable cost.Anyways, if their service does follow up, this is a great website to buy economic tickets for flights, and I will comment/edit this if something goes wrong. If I don't, you can buy tickets from here.
5	I made a dumb mistake on my booking and realized it shortly after. I reached out via chat to customer service, and Karen took excellent care of me. She helped me correct the issue and made it easy!Thanks for the help!
5	I had a problem with My reservation where i did a misstake, but i Got the best help and a Quick help from Olesya and Serhii. Thank you so Much for the best help i could get!

5	The webpage wasn't loading so I decided to contact customer support. Aleksandra Mrzyglod was the one to assist me on the matter. Everything was resolved in a matter of minutes. Thank a lot for everything.
5	I had a problem with a flight and it was resolved very fast!!! Zuzana S you are my personal super hero! God bless you!!!
5	I would like to thank Mrs. VeronikaB for reacting swiftly to my request. Thank you Kiwi for the nice service!
1	"no wordsi want to tell you s0ome words about me, i traveling a lot, each month i have at least 1 flight and i now enough websites for bying tickets, but skypicer is the worst, it is the first time, when i left comment on trustpilot, just to tell everybody, that it is not a company - it is something unuseful.also, i have typed random reference number just because of the thing, that this guys had no time to help me to resolve my problem with booking.so guys, i had bad experience two times with skypicker, and two times tere was the same problem, and they can not change something.first time it was 2 month ago, i have used chat to connect to customer support to check, why i can not book a ticket, second time it was today, so, today i was talking to mark(as he told me, he is something like manager there, but i do not beleve, cause their support is awful, they can not help, they are unhelpful, it was 2 month ago, they told(dmitriy it was), that they have some technikal problems with their website, and now the same situation, so, it looks like: i have found some tickets, but i can not book, and always the same, also the friend of mine told, that she has paid for tickets but this ""company"" had not received her money and had not booked the ticket for her, but the money were charged from her bank account. also, from the side of my experience: if you have some problems with booking - they can not help, they are working with some strange system, i think, that they book their tickets off the record, cause, i have booked tickets through the airline`s website and the diff in prise between skypicker and airlines website was near 10%, i was trying to find this information on their website (i mean, information about fees, but no!, an it is illegitimately), no, really, i am ready to pay them this 10% it is not so much, but the servise should be really helpful and good. have you ever tried to call them? - it is not english, it is some mix between english and russian and it is awful."
5	I had a problem with my passport number that was in the wrong format (I still don't know why) and Tomáš Mužík  helped me to solve that by filling the number and expiry date himself. Great guy and great service! :)
5	Super customer service and prices! :relaxed: Big thanks to Babak on customer service for useful information :relaxed:
5	Aside from being a great and easy to use flight booking website. I had to change my details on a multi-airline round trip booking, and Filip went out of his way to contact the airlines personally and change my details, really good service!
5	Mohamed Abdelkader did an excellent job answering my questions about getting priority seating my flights and the cost He did a follow up phone call to keep my appraised of the progress he was making. He then sent an email confiriming the total cost for getting priority seatingThank you so much
5	An excellent experience so far, genius system and very nice staff at helpdesk (warmest regards to Yuriy N. who was extremely nice and helped me yesterday with my check-in!). Will definitely use Skypicker again, and I recommend it to everyone.
5	Had some troubles with inserting the personal data, so Lydie helped me out in the live chat very quickly. She corrected the data and answered some questions I still had relating to the flight. Nice atmosphere and professional service. Thank you!
5	It was the good interface, the kind help, economic and magnificent flight!The following travel - only with you!
5	Really good service. Easy to find cheapest and most convenient flight. I made a mistake during bookind - manager Mohamed have corrected it for free.
5	The booking process itself was easy & simple. All the emails were provided on a timely manner & all information was clear.Thank you Skypicker!
3	This New App Will Find You the Cheapest International Flight <https://t.co/jYZEYzYCYn>
5	Brilliant service and very helpful. Fast and efficient
5	Simon did a great job finding an alternative flight for me, thank you!
5	I contacted customer service through the live chat and Jan Lukasec helped me receive my boarding pass in less than 30 minutes. Thanks for everything Jan.
5	Katerina G supported very well via on-line chat being patient when I needed to do a few other things at the same time. Problem well solved.
4	Mister Dallal helped me very well to add some more luggage to my booked flight. Too bad the system is so complicated, but in the end with the good help its all fine now, thx!
5	There's only 2 Reps I can understand clearly when they spoke with me it was Rep Egor and Rep Micheala! They helped me resolved my issue and was able to get the refund the money of declined booking transactions I made (Reference No. 1733428 & 1733155).Rep Egor answered all my questions thoroughly, professionally and efficiently! He was clear and patient with me I hope you guys can listen to the call because I strongly believe he did an AMAZING job! You guys should give him some reward for it! I was so frustrated because for some reason my bank which is the Bank of America keep declining my booking transaction and I though I'm gonna miss my vacation to Vagas but, here comes Rep Egor! I spoked with him and in timely manner I got this peace of mind that everything's is gonna resolved!!!Thank you for keeping Reps like Egor and Micheala! I would definitely recommend and forever be a loyal costumer with you guys because of them! You guys just made my day! Again high five Those amazing Reps for me since I'm not able to do so. You guys just made my day! Thank you very much to you guys!!! More power!Meriane
5	Lucie was very helpful and friendly. If trouble, I'd like to be helped by her again
1	"So this is my second review, I had to delete the first one because Skypicker chose to post my booking and passenger details publicly on Facebook. Skypicker, please reach out to me directly and not share customer details publicly. But thank you for finally answering!Here's my original review, which I'll post again. ""Thought I give Skypicker a try, but unfortuntaely had a terrible experience. They've provided us with the wrong information about our flight (ryanair). They emailed us, we have to check in at the airport (but we knew airport check-in isn't available for ryanair). Tried to check in online, didn't work, no one answered our emails. Went to airport early to sort it out with ryanair directly, but they said they had this issue with skypicker before and there's nothing they can do for us... and we had to deal with extra fees (90€) and stress. Tried to contact Skypicker customer service afterwards, but still haven't received an answer. ryanair and skypicker is a combination that definitely does not work!In reply to your public message: What you are mentioning is exactly the problem. THERE IS NO CHECK IN FOR RYAN AIR AT THE AIRPORT, so why are you offering it on your website? And what you are saying is ""once you choose it, you are trapped? Deal with check in yourself? With the information you've provided in your email (booking numner etc) there was no online check possible through the ryanair app . Even when we went to the airport they did not find us in the system by the information you've provided. Please help us sort this out and for further communcation we kindly ask you to reply to our emails."
5	Pavel Fridrich, the agent that was helping me was great and very helpful. Thanks :)
5	foarte buna aplicatia si site-ul
1	I had worst experience with skypicker. Their skypicker guarantee is a joke. Missed connecting because my flight was late due to medical emergency. Paid hefty amount reach destination..emailed several times for claim but nothing happened. Will never use them.
2	Go with these guys and guaranteed you will get to HELL as soon as you book your travel nightmare. Go Expedia or some other and save money
5	Pavel Kachlik and Irina Selezneva were very helpful with info and services, I have had a great experience so far with Skypicker.
5	User friendly, quick searcher with nice visual map, which I find really helpful during deciding. Great experience they simply bring what customer needs: simple and well arranged searcher. Go on kiwi go on! I am waiting for your hostel/hotel searcher too ;)
5	@jetradar_com is disgusting:it shows awesome prices&forwards u to @skypickercom but there u get notification that price has been...doubled!
5	I booked my recent trip to Bulgaria with Skypicker. I found that everything went to plan and there were no delays on any of my flights. I will book my next trip with Skypicker.Robert.
1	I booked return flights from lax to msy. On my my return flight from msy there was a stop over  in Vegas.  Since the reservations were different I had to recheck the baggage in vegas and pay again for checked baggage. (I paid $300 for my within weight limit checked baggage) Even though it was spirit airlines for all my flights. I understand if I had to recheck the bags for a different airline. Very dissapointed with the service.
5	Having used Skypicker for the first time, I am thrilled at how helpful the online support was in assisting with my mundane questions about luggage allowance and seat booking.  Tomas Taubinger was extremely helpful and went out of his way to get me the best deal.  I am now very excited about my upcoming holiday knowing that all the small details have been taken care of.  I shall definitely use this website again, and will also refer to my friends to use.  Thank you again Skypicker .....
5	Thank you so much Skypicker! And especially Issis Castro for your most helpful and satisfying customer service! I forgot to check in in time, but you surely saved me on the edge. The service was quickly in process and taken care of in now time! I am so grateful. I can now relax and look forward to my flight once again. Best regards Sally
5	Super toller Service und freundliches Team. Besser geht es nicht
5	very easy and convenient. I definitely will use this service again!
5	Excellent service from your customer supporter James
5	Using secure payments is an issue nowadays and i believe in having strictly approved and checked bank transfers. However this could be pain as well. As such occurred, I'm very happy with the help of Leonardo and Bogdan who assisted me through and eventually the booking could be made. Good job and continue with the great work in the future. cheerio,Savina
5	I was planning for a trip for a long time. I wanted to surprise my girlfriend, and I bought a ticket on <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com>. The thing is that I didn't pay close attention and made an error in my first and last names( actually,  I logged in with my Facebook account and my name changed automatically )so obviously I wouldn't be able to flight, if it wans't for the people in <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> that helped me pretty fast,- I was in communication from the online chat with Aliz, a friend of mine on the phone with Isabelle N. and I suppose Anita F.was dealing with Ryanair. I just write this review to let you know that these people helped me a lot today, and I am beyond bounds thankfull to them!!
5	Hey, i would like to thank kiwi for the good support in the last 2 days. Especially Dorota have to mentioned here. Friendly, helpful, smart and funny. Talking to a call center is normally something people wanna avoid, but she made even this moment special. Good job. I am looking forward to use kiwi in the future again.CHR ;)
5	When I saw that my flight was delayed and I was pretty sure that I was going to loose my other flight I sent skypicker an email about this and when I arrived in the airport and turned on my mobile phone someone from skypicker called me and she told me that she saw that I have lost my flight and gave me other flights options and 30 minutes later I got my new tickets on my email!!Amazing!! I'd recommend skypicker for everyone!Thank you so much for your support!!
5	I accidentally booked the wrong flight and was promptly helped by the team at <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com>. Less than 24h after my request I got confirmarion that the flight was chances without any additional fee (as it was still within the 24h grace period). Amazing!
1	"Awful, awful travel agents. Have made the same complaint now 4 times and no one has got back to me beyond ""we are dealing with your request"" and it has been 6 weeks!Long story short - booking error on my account when making an initial booking - their website kept timing me out and increasing the prices for a long itinerary. I finally managed to book, but accidentally input my husbands DOB as 2016, instead of 1987. No problem - got in touch and it took them FOUR days to come back to me and say, apparently, the airlines will not amend the date of birth as I had booked an infant seat (AT FULL ADULT PRICE I MIGHT SAY), I had to pay again for majority of the itinerary, which meant I was a full adult price down. Ok I thought...my mistake...will take it.BUT THENOne of the legs from KL to Penang the flight had not been changed over to provide my husband with an adult seat and I had to pay at the airport for my husbands seat. The airline said no money had ever been sent to them for my husbands seat. So there I was having to pay AGAIN. I wasted $50 ringing <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> and spoke to someone absolutely useless. I did end up claiming it back but it took 3 weeks and they used the exchange rate which came up the cheapest and I lost another $5 on top of that.I spoke to all the airlines involved and they all said they had the money for each flight I had booked with an infant....which works out to be around 120gbp altogether. SO TELL ME <http://KIWI.COM|KIWI.COM> WHERE DID THE EXTRA 360GBP go and why could that not be offset against the new flights??? and I had to pay a further 400GBP?! Hmmm....I might add that each airline, particularly Air Asia was absolutely shocked that a full adult price was allowed to processed for an infant seat (an infant seat is an add on which at most will be 40GBP) and agreed it's really really weird that the price difference seemed to be sucked into some bandit vortex.What makes me really angry is that initially I didn't even ask for a refund of the difference, I asked for the T&C's of booking so I could take a look. But they won't even send me that.Sucks to be you <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> I have another 4 complex itineraries to book in the next 18 months and I sure as hell will NOT be coming via you. You are atrocious.Even when you said you had changed over two of the flights for my husbands actual seat after I paid I still had to chase and chase you for the etickets."
5	Sena was assisting me today with a few questions I had regarding my baggage allowance. She responded promptly and efficiently to all questions I had. She even suggested calling the airlines for me to verify whether I could get some extra luggage and verify if I could get a personal item on board apart from my cabin bag, and she told me she would do this within 2 hours. Overall, I am happy with the CS received today. Keep hiring people like her!
5	In a panic I realized that I hadn't received my confirmation email and was soon to catch my flight,Luckily Miroslav was right there to assist with the very useful online chat!Much appreciated and great service - thanks a million!
4	I missed a flight and called to get a new flight through kiwi. Talked to many different people at kiwi, most of the needing some costumer service training, but then Lukas Kouril was but on our case. He made sure everything worked out well, explained possible solutions and we're extremely helpful. I would hope to reach Lukas again if I use kiwi next time!
5	<http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> is one of the best websites for traveling. As a web developer, I'm impressed at the level of attention paid in creating the website.
1	I booked yesterday a flight Bangkok Sydney, through your services.I had one bagage. No warning appear on the website. When I received my confirmation I have a note letting me know that I have to register my bagage again. So it means, pick my bagage, immigration, Check in again, immigration again in two hours...I called you yesterday to ask to manage my flight, or cancel as my credit card hasn't been debited yet. You refused and had been rude to me, one agent screamed at phone.I went through the airlines company website. My flight is actually operated by the same company. First flight is tiger air operated by scoot second flight is Scoot...As well I paid 323 plus 83 for my Bagages, on the website company the flight ticket is at 224 dollars and they offer pisdiblility to cancel the booking.I had email you, no reply, I had a chat online, not any answer to my questions. You just told me I should be ok in two hours, as its average time.My questions are:- why you offer this travel with not any warning before the booking and not any clear explanation? Why you don't inform clearly your customers- What happen if I don't have time to catch up my second flight because you ask me to leave and register again?- why you ask me to register again for a flight operated by the same company? If I do booking with them straight away I don't have to leave the airport?- why such a big difference between your prices and the airline company?- why you refuse to cancel the booking when the airline company offer that possibility?-why youI am still waiting your answers and wish to have a safe trip.
1	Negligence of duty and they make me spend two nights in a foreign land without justifying to me why. I was  left abandon  and deny entry to flight Azerbaijan Airlines 841235 because i did not have transit visa to Turkey. when i was going to Azerbaijan, i transit through Turkey without any transit through Turkey without any transit visa and also change planes. i am frustrated and stranded for two days now and they still cant do anything.
4	I needed to upgrade my luggage allowance. Skypicker customer services responded to my email enquiry very quickly and called me back when I asked them to. They were very helpful and did all the leg work required to upgrade my luggage.
5	I am very satisfy with the prompt replies from Skypicker support team especially to Mariya Podglaznaya and Olga Holodova. Skypicker helped me to order special assistance services from the airlines. Thank you :)
4	<http://SkyPicker.com|SkyPicker.com> helped me check in online as well as reminded me of the details of my flight. All easy and helpful!
2	A startup that finds discount flight tickets 'hidden' on airline websites just launched in the US <https://t.co/psYjcS5I1n> via Maya Kosoff
5	Many thanks Issis Castro for professional help and efficiency in solving my problem
5	I had no problems using Skypicker and everything was easy even on mobile and using it for the first time!
5	I had a confusion regarding my booking and this was solved very efficiently and fast by Valentin, who was also very kind.I will definitely use Kiwi again and recommend it to others.
5	I cannot recommend Skypicker highly enough!I needed to get a Saturday return flight back to Central Europe from the Canaries, and no airline offered a connection, be it direct or otherwise. Skypicker linked two Ryanair flights together (I had had to recheck my bag in London) and got me home that evening. The combination was not visible directly from Ryanair, who actually didn't advertise both flights at all, andliterally every other airline or booking site said I would have to spend the night somewhere in Europe and get a flight home the next morning.For cheaper than the alternatives, Skypicker found a connection and got me home on time.The only hiccup was that I needed the Skypicker email to check-in online with Ryanair. But a service rep got me the booking email, and it worked without a hitch.
1	When I got to the airport for my red eye w/ 1 layover and went to get my ticket, I was told that Kiwi booked me on two separate flights which means I have to pick up my luggage at my layover, get an additional ticket and pay an additional $40.00 for my luggage. So now my luggage is costing me $80.00 plus I have to go through all the checkpoints after an all night flight. This cost me more and so much heartache. No mention of this was made at time of purchase....Caveat Emptor...let the buyer beware!!!
3	I'm using Skypicker for Christmas traveling, find out why <https://t.co/LHhCILNN72>
5	Really good service and very reliable company. Extremely cheap prices compared to others. Would definitely buy again and recommend to anyone!Thank you skipicker
4	David helped me with my online check in, he was fast and really polite. Really good service!
5	I had issues with my booking with Pegasus flight, but thanks to a chat customer support service I got from Radek from the Czech Republic, I had manage to get my boarding passes and all issues resolved. Thank you Radek, for a great and fast service!
1	@skypickercom 8 hour delay while your booking office is trying to book a flight??? Is that in your control? Skypicker service fail
5	<http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> customer service is awesome :) On 19th October a friend of mine missed her flight, which was heading from Sweden to Norway, due to a delay matter, and she couldn't call <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> . So I called the customer service on behalf of her and they were so helpful. They solved the problem directly without hesitation :)You got the <http://ref.nr|ref.nr> so please reach the greets to the guys those I spoke with :)BestSam
5	It was not the first time I used Skypicker and I didn&#39;t meet any issue for my first travel with them. This time, I didn&#39;t succeed to communicate my passport number in time and did not receive my boarding pass, so I sent an e-mail to the support team. Kristina took over my case and I received my boarding pass in just one hour. I will definitely continue to use Skypicker in the future.
5	My flight from Singapore to Sydney were cancelled and I missed to confirm the replacement flight and I got a call from one of the agents named Sajar who helped me find another one even though the flight was fully booked! Really helpful and friendly staff, they reply fast on email and take time to help one out!
5	I had an excellent experience with skypicker. They fixed my additional baggage in almost no time, and helped me change my flight departure date easily and usign a chat conversation, no need of phone.Everything went smoothly and according to the agreed.Thanks
5	Yulia Y helped me a lot, she was outstanding, thank you once again ! :)
5	Catalina attended to my request for a change of flight in a prompt & efficient manner. Happy to do business with <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> again
5	I had missed the email about providing passport information for the check in, but Nina was a great help and helped me out instantly. Thank you!
5	Very good service! very patient and very kind person Lucie G....She answered me to all my  inquiries!!
5	Ms Kayuda supported me with my passport number change. She promised to reply via Email, which she fulfilled inbetween 20 minutes.Kind support!
5	I contacted Kiwi's online messenger service and was delighted with the fast, kind, and helpful response. Enri-A responded immediately and was professional and hard working. When I communicated that I wished to cancel a flight, he immediately contacted the airline on my behalf. In my experience thus far, this provider cares about its customers.
5	Very trustworthy and excellent follow up service!  The live chat help is a great tool, and Thomas and Elsa were very kind and efficient in helping me immediately 24/7.
5	Excellent customer service delivered by Natalya P.. Customer focussed service the fuel of any organisation. Keep on doing the good job.
1	DO NOT BOOK WITH THIS SITE EVER!!! this is my first time using this site and could not be more disappointed. On the site, it says that my flight costs $307 and i paid in full already. i waited and i did not received my confirmation booking. and then i called and they said i have to pay an additional amount of $90 to book my flight. THEY should be responsible for that fee because it is no way MY responsibility. this site is a fraud if they continue to do this, they will be sued sooner or later. they SHOULD pay that fee and give me my confirmation booking. please be responsible.
5	I have been using <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> to book most of my flights for the last two months, (10 flights) and I have been very impressed with the ease of use and reliability their app and website both offer.I experienced their excellent customer service first hand while in Valencia. I had a 2 hour layover and unfortunately, due to a glitch in the system, I had not been automatically checked in, and my booking pass was not sent to me. I contacted customer service via their chat opion, and was connected with Filip, less than an hour before my flight.Within that hour Filip and the team were able to pull a rabbit out of their hat and save me from being stranded in Spain. They made sure I would catch my flight. I have absolute faith and trust in the support offered by Kiwi, and will continue to use them to book my flights in the future.I reccomend Kiwi to all my friends and fellow travellers.Thank you again Filip and Kiwi team!
5	"They were able to arrange vegetarian meals on our long flights with no extra charge. Polite and helpful people. Also, the map on <http://skypicker.com|skypicker.com> and the option to choose ""Anywhere"" as the destination, to find the cheapest way to get from one continent to another is very handy. Would recommend whenever their offers are price competitive."
5	<http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> certainly has the best prices for airline tickets.Both the site and the mobile app work great.And the best of all is the service. I accidentally booked a ticket for the wrong date. Kiwi employee Josef did a great job helping me getting a refund. Thanks again for that Josef! Now i have booked with <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> the same great flight for a great price but  this time on the right date. Martin
1	They presented flights as connecting when making reservations . Now I must pay for my baggage on all my connections because they were really seperate flights.  So one way I paid $100 for my small luggage and will have to pay another $100 to return home with my luggage. Now #skypicker says I booked 4 seperate flights. I choose from options #skypicker displayed. Lesson learned. Booking directly from airline.
5	I booked a flight from New Orleans to Buenos Aires through Kiwi - a trip that included four flights by two different airlines (via Fort Lauderdale, Lima, and Santiago) and my second flight was delayed, I landed after 1 in the morning meaning I missed my second and third connection. I called Kiwi and right away they calmed me down (I was quite stressed out by the whole thing), took my details, said they would call me back with a solution within the hour, and they did! They rebooked me on a different flight, all sorted, didn't have to pay anything, and they sent me confirmation of the new flights by email, everyone I spoke to was polite, helpful and alert.
4	I wasn't too sure about the online check in so I used the online chat for help. Service was very fast and friendly, Samael was very zealous to help me with more specific questions about airlines.
5	Good prices and excellent customer support services.
5	There was a mistake in my name on my flight tickets for the 3 flights I booked. I was on a liveaboard just after my reservation when I found out there was a mistake and did not have any network. I receive a response to my email when I came back but it was already two days before departure. Thanks to Jana, Marketa, Klara and Radim amd their reactivity, my name from both the two airline companies had been changed before departure !Thank you very much !
4	I have found this site very useful , as it has given me more option between the flights, then any other website. Definitely would recommend to search one time here before booking from any other website.
1	You mixed my first and last name as well as my passport expiry name and my birthday and I had issues boarding  at both airports with both Airlines. You also did not specify that my Norwegian flight at Gattwick was at a totally different terminal and how to get there. Horrendous experience. Please how you acted in a previous booking that should've been completely refunded, I wouldn't recommend you to my dog, never mind a human. I will tell everyone else how bad a company you are!!
5	Frist time booking with <http://skypicker.com|skypicker.com>. And I can say it was great, found cheaper flights then through direct airlines.  I had to add an addition luggage towards my flight and with the help of  Jiří Červenka on live chat, it made my process so much easier. Great service and in a timely manner. Process was smooth and quick.
5	J avais une question sur les cartes d embarqurments qui n apparaissaient pas sur mon mail et Eric l interlocuteur joint ce soir par telephone a traite mon probleme rapidement avec beaucoup de professionalisme . Felicitations. C est la premiere fois que j utilise ce site et je le recommande.
1	We purchased ticket for my mom to fly from LAX to IST. Her first flight was to Stockholm via Norwagiean Airlines and then second flight was from Stockholm to Istanbul via Turkish Airlines. We specifically asked on the phone to Kiwi customer service rep on the phone about the visa requirement and the person said the US greencard should be enough to transit through. My mom found out that this wasnt the case while she was at the counter to get her tickets. She had to buy another ticket to Istanbul - spent another $1500 for one way flight. I am looking at the reservation information also and there is no place it says anything about the visa requirement at all. The customer service rep gave us wrong information. The rep didnt even know the luggage weight limits; he was saying 15kg but it was actually 20kg. Horrible service please stay away!!!
5	I've been helped by Mohammed, he was very kind. He's such a polite person, very nice and patient. It was a big pleasure to ask him for help. He reassured me.
5	Dear Eric,Thank you so much for your precious help in solving my problem in a few minutes!
2	A startup that finds 'hidden' discount flight tickets just launched in the US <https://t.co/W9XGQsFQEy> via sai (htt… <https://t.co/h4EYlGVzwt>
5	everything was excellent
5	I used many services for finding best deals of flight tickets and Kiwi saved me a lot of money! As an example direct return flight would cost me over 400 EUR but Kiwi managed to find solution for 160. I like that Kiwi takes care of online check-in and all you need to do is just download e-ticket.No other flight ticket services were able to find such a good flight connections as Kiwi. I joined them when they were Skypicker and will continue to use them and recommend them to my friends.
5	I purchased a ticket through <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com>, and mistakenly wrote the spelling wrong in the name, while purchasing it. I was helped to resolved this issue by Ms. Dorota Žigová & Ms. Angella. Ms. Dorota Žigová did the magic and changed the name in the ticket as per my passport within 01 hour of my request. I have not seen any other 24/7 online chat this prompt and supportive. Thanks a lot for your assistance Would be glad to do the business again.GureyshaJFM - Maldives
5	"It was the first time for me booking with <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com>. It is great that they show you single flight opportunities other companies/search engines  not even offer, so i could find a really cheap flight from an airport in my area. I really like the ""radar modus"" so it searches above a broad area of airports in your surrounding and compares prices/flight times etc.Also the whole booking process is super easy. They sent you e.mails for every new process so you know what kind of status you have, check- in for you automatically and you receive everything in time.Also the customer service is super friendly and fast. You can chat with them and they respond super fast.Thank you Jan Lukasek for answering my questions."
4	used the site to make a booking, i loved the options that the algorithm pulls, can use a multi-destination feature but i heard it's coming. thanks to Petr for a nice chat too.
5	"I had some issues with the confirmation of my ID . An Agent named ""Neil"" helped me out a lot , answered all my questions and solved my problem in less than 10 minutes. I'm glad they have people kind and helpful like him. Good job"
5	I contacted <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> and spoke with Michal who was very helpful and professional. He answered my queries with great ease. I would have no hesitation in using this company and look forward to using their services. Thank you Michal. Well done. Joy
3	I AM VERY HAPPY BECAUSE I HAVE chosen your company. I thanks all the Employers in the  e.mail service and in the chat online for there help and l thank Emre.T . For helping me .Thank you very much for a wonderful  website.
5	As a agency I would rate 3 stars, but because of your employees I rated with 5 stars. Massive thanks to Lukas and Gregorian,both of them helped me this morning fixing my problems. But as I said I don't like the agency and the politics about refunding .
1	Worst customer experience with a company like this ever. First flight was delayed so much that I could not catch my connecting flight in Copenhagen (I recognise this is of course out of Kiwi's control although they should not have allowed such little time between flights) and after being denied a phone call in the airport my boyfriend in Ireland had to call Kiwi to talk to customer support which took about 5 hours to receive any kind of response as every time we called we were told they would call us back with what they could do, which they did not and required us to go through the process every time we rang. To then be told they would not rebook me on any of the 5 flights that day but on the cheapest Ryanair flight the day after. With no offer of compensation for food or accommodation we finally convinced them to allow me €50 to stay in a hostel that night which they would repay once I emailed them the receipt. After sending emails with the receipts and not getting any reply I called them today to be told they received an email from their manager telling them not to pay us the €50 even after we have it in writing telling us that they would. We will be reporting them to Consumer Watchdog and Skyscanner and would advise NOBODY deals with this SCAM of a company!
5	Please convey our thanks to Mr. Bachana,  who helped me and my wife dealing our problem on phone. We appreciate that! It is always good when you feel important by the company!
4	Thanks Juan Costa for quick help with sending boardingpasses!
4	Thank you Avid for your help.The best support for information.
4	Even if my booking wasn't a very normal one, Skypickers support helped me out a lot.I had to change my flight to a nother flight after i already booked. First i got a link which didn't work but the live support with Enri A. helped me out and i immediately was able to do everything i wanted.Nice system and nice customer help.Thank you Enri A.!
5	Great experience so far! I had once issue, which was resolved promptly. Awesome customer service as well! Would use services again and also recommend! Thank-you Skypicker!!
5	This message is to thanks Petra for her wonderfull support and great service. I had a reservetion and I wanted to add a new bag to my reservation, and it was explained and performed very fast. Thank you Petra and Kiwi
5	"I made a reservation and got an e-mail saying that 4 hours after I would get my tickets. I was a little nervous when 4 hours after I got another e-mail saying they were having ""a delay"", I called right away and Miss Petra Musilova gently answered and explained the reasons, one hours after I got my tickets. So far is being an easy and good experience, also I got a good deal for my flight."
5	Staff member Alan was very helpful and patient.

5	Valentin helped us to clarify some issues with airline. Given support was very fast and competent. All questions were answered.Great job!
5	Lucie G. was absolutely fantastic with helping me quickly, and as I have very little time and never bother to leave reviews, there's no doubt that I'll be saying that your customer service is great if they're having issues with other companies. Thanks again Lucie, you are great!
5	I just spoke to an agent named Daniela through online chat. Our flight was cancelled, so we had to be booked on another flight, and she was very helpful in explaining everything and arranging things to minimize the inconvenience. Great customer service :) Thanks, Daniela!
4	a very big thank you to Jan Lukasek who is really trying to help me out in  my bad situation. great service!
5	I contacted Skypicker when i have problem with my check-in. Cintia Schelbauer returned the mail very fast and give me the answer to my questions. Now all it's clear. Thanks!
5	I really reccomend Skypicker! I traveled to Italy by booking with them, and they solved an issue that my flight was cancelled on the way to Italy and they rescaduled all my flight to Italy (included connection) and they called me on the phone and asked me about if its ok the new flightplan and they booked it for me! And on the way back to Norway I called them on the phoneline and asked to add an extra luggage and they did it for me, and sendt me a link on my email where i payed only for the extra luggage. So I am really satisfied with this choiche of using Skypicker and I am going to reccomend them to all my friends and family!
5	Thanks a lot for Jonathan help. I messed up a little bit when I booked the flight for my mom, and I called Skypicker. Jonathan was very helpful and patient. He solved the problem.
5	I needed help to change something in my ticket and got a really good service from mr Jurik Thomas. Thank you very much!
5	great prompt servicesatisfied customer
5	I have a great price on the ticket and a unique online service experience with  Aamer tageldinthnk you
5	Our booking was done easily without any problems at all.   I cannot say anything negative at all about skypicker and would happily recommend them or use them again myself.
1	"I booked a trip from Melbourne to Bali, 2 passengers for low fair. <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> processed my payment and then said there where ""technical issues"" and I will be refunded.I called and they said there would be a 10 day wait. I was in disbelief as they took my funds without confirming the tickets. It's been over 20 days and still on refund! I've emailed them, chat them and I've been on hold on their AUS contact line for over half an hour and i have not heard back.These guys are a scam. They may work for some people but they chose to rip others off. You can not trust them.I booked through Skyscanner and got referred to <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>. I'm writing an email to Skyscanner to inform them them that their third party bookers <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> should not be a part of Skyscanners umbrella."
5	Thank you Emra at live chat customer service for helping me to enter my passport details since I couldn't find it on the Skypicker site where to enter the info and for helping me doing the online check in for me. There were no problems and everything worked smoothly.
5	Zuzana is great. Polite and friendly. i had some difficulties to explain my point of view, Zuzana manage it professionally.NIce Kiwi for your customers Care service
1	I booked two ryanair flights on skypicker, as I had to leave and return in two different airports and ryanair website require two separate booking (and two credit card fees).Problem encountered: impossible to buy a luggage for only the return flight. But I thought it was ok, I could also add a luggage to a single flight later, I know that ryanair allows this at the same price as while doing the initial booking.Well, Skypicker doesn't!It was impossible to manage flights separately on the website, so I had to call the customer service: Eleonora and Carlo were pretty rapid and effective. However, the issue remains that the cost of the added luggage was higher than on the initial booking! So they had a fare to your modification, that was not stated at the beginning!Finally, I think that counting this cost, and the surcharges they put on the initial reservation (about 20 euros) the two bookings on ryanair would have been less expensive! And surely faster!So, I'll never use skypicker anymore!
4	I had a few problems after putting in some wrong anyformation about my passport, but I just opened a chat window, got connected within 5 minutes and then the kind Oga guided me through and sorted the information, can't complain about anything else than the website being a bit confusing. Customer service on point
5	Serieta', cortesia e professionalita, e un grazie particulate a Daniel per la sua disponiblita' , prontezza nel rispondere alle tue richieste, a risolvere I problemi nel migliore dei modi.
5	Just finished up chatting to David on the Live Chat service. He was incredibly helpful even though I had several queries regarding my booking. He talked me through some questions regarding booking info and seat selection, and I am very comfortable that if I need help in future he will be willing and able! Thanks David!
5	We had not recieved our boarding cards before arriving at the airport. So we called and a very nice woman amswered. She was so helpful and re-sent the bording passes right away. She also called back two times to see if we got the e-mail. Everything worked out and we got on the plane =) Even if they forgot to send the bording passes, the service was perfect and fast! All aces!
5	I would ask for updated my passport details since I renew my new passport, and I checked on my new flight timing. She is very fast and quick and very helpful even remind me of my flights time. Thanks Valery.
1	Kiwi rob Indonesian people, i guess kiwi do trick for payment, they charged only 1% on sms, so kiwi can charge credit card over limit, coz when customers from indonesia do crosscheck to their bank, bank told them that they credit hasnt post yet (with same amount 1%). But then kiwi charged it with full amount, if only kiwi charge full amount from the first time, over limit credit card wont happen. Kiwi makes execuse that the problem was with their third party (payment gateway), if so, why you make us, as your customers have to pay over limit. Its so crazy when credit card only have limit for credit about 6M IDR, and you charge us for 40M IDR. I want full refund, give me back my money, 100%. This is all your fault
5	Excellent customer support. The livechat provided me with answers in seconds, and with good courtesy and manners. If all their employees are as effective, I don't see why anyone could complain.Strongly recommended.
5	I received help from 2 operators: Eleonora and Kristina. They solved the issue quickly, professionally and in a very effective way.I'll be glad to use this service again.
5	Well, what can I say? The help I received on looking for alternatives for my reservation greatly exceeded my expectations. Waqar Hassan was extremely helpful, and for several hours patiently looked for best alternative routes from Mexico to Europe despite me quite constantly changing my mind about the date of departure. I couldn't be happier with the service I received.All the best!E.N.
5	I discovered when checking the printed copies of my tickets that I had 'Mr' rather than 'Miss' as the title.  I contacted Skypicker via the live chat function and Emre T was the agent that helped me.  I provided a brief description of what was wrong and provided my reference number and Emre T took care of the rest.Fantastic service.
5	At the very last minute, we need to add 6 additional pieces of luggage.  Serhii was very attentive, good to his word, and was able to follow through with our request!  Thank you Serhii:)
4	"I was initially frustrated when trying to receive a refund for a flight, even through following the proper procedures. After finding out about the chat option, I got in touch with Aliz. She completely turned the situation around and restored a good relation to <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>. Aliz listened and heard my points, and took it upon her self to ""be like a lawyer"" and obtained a refund amount which I viewed as a win-win situation. She proclaimed ""we are the champions"" when she told me the new refund amount. These comments not only made my day, but showed me that the employees are willing to go above and beyond. She could have easily brushed me off and said that no refund was available. I fully appreciate Aliz's efforts to resolve the situation, and she has set a new standard for what I expect from customer service representative's everywhere. Thank you, Aliz! We are the champions!"
5	Had some wrong info in booked tickets but skypicker team fixed it within minutes!
5	Very nice and helpful support team, immediately answered all my questions and helped me to contact the airlines and add an extra luggage I needed. Thank you!
5	Good service
5	Daniel Horák Many thanks for quick turnaround! Daniel Horák Many thanks for quick turnaround!
5	Victoria Ch was helpful on my concern regarding my booking process, because I will be a passenger from Ho Chi Minh going to Doha Qatar, and my concern is my friend will be booking me and I'm a little worry because I don't have my friends credit card to show at the airport. Victoria Ch explained that there will be no problem if my friend pays for my ticket and they will provide sufficient documents before I leave. Thanks
4	Skypicker told me that my ticket did not include no baggage at all, so I call to the airline to verified that, and skypicker was wrong, mi ticket include one baggage and one hand baggage.
5	James T. offered the best service I've encountered on an international flight site. He went way beyond the norm and offered extra information and even travel tips... Hospitality in the very British sense of the word! Very very well done.
5	I am very satisfied with the service of Skypicker.
1	Due to the company not providing good information about travel arrangements we were forced to pay an extra 100 euro for a fare that cost 100 euro in total, if i wanted to travel expensive i could easily do that, the reason we chose to buy our tickets fra <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> was due to the price.Don´t choose this company !!!
5	Talked to Eric, he provided 5 star customer support. He sort my problem out within 2 minutes. Highly appreciated! Thank you Eric
5	I accidentally changed my flight date but thanks to the immediate answer from a chat help agent, it was put back in order! Thank you, Ira V.
5	Tickets were the cheapest I could find and the whole experience with Kiwi was spot on!
5	Haven't flown with kiwi yet (due to fly in September) but we had a problem with putting in passport details as both of us are in the process of getting our passports renewed, but I just wanted to thank Aura for her great help in clearing up the matter, and the quickness and ease with which she was able to do it for us!
5	Eric helped me out a lot, great service.
5	Since I could no-longer find my booking confirmation e-mails from Skypicker, I called the customer service team and I had the pleasure to speak with  Mr. A. Dallal, who listened to my problem and efficiently and promptly supported and resolved my request in few minutes. Since I am a HR manager, I immediately undestood that this guy professionally represent Skypicker and he produces brilliant work. I confess this is my first time I have used Skypicker, but, from now on, I will recommend it to my acquaintances and friends. There are several websites like this one, but people who work there, make the difference!
5	Both great and sorted my issue perfectly and with care.

5	Norwegian air flight was delayed coming outta copenhagen, killing all my connections, and when I landed my return tickets had been resorted at no extra cost, plus a $50 dollar voucher for a hotel (had to stay overnight for the new itinerary).  Super easy experience, will definitely use again.

4	<http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> was the only way I could access a very cheap fare being offered on a new route.  I usually do all my own bookings but so I used <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> and it was fine.  Responded to emails and did what it needed to to ensure my travel arrangements worked.
5	All said at the upper box. Keep up the good work.D.A.
5	excellent service, I did not expect such a quick response , so I am satisfied with this site , especially for the kindness of T. Emre greetings
5	I broke my foot a couple of days before traveling.  The gentleman Eric was most helpful in guiding me through the process of getting a refund.
5	I was having problems with my flight reservation for a trip to Cuba.  I was notified that my payment had been received for the flight. Unfortunately the other emails I was receiving alerted me to the fact that my reservation had been delayed. Or there were technical problems.  I waited almost an hour to see if the issues had been cleared up.  Finally I call <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> to see what was happening to my reservation.  I was more than a little annoyed and I was a bit impatient.  I spoke with Travel Consultant, Serhil Kiian.  He was so very kind and listened to my problems with the reservation and how this flight effected the trip I was taking with my two children.  He asked me to hang on for 5 mins, he went to check with another operator and returned with the good news that my reservations had been confirmed.  He could not have been more comforting and more helpful.  Thank you Serhil.Jane
5	On the morning of my flight I couldn't find my boarding Pass. I opened up web chat on the website. it was very easy ans within minutes all my questions were answered! It was a nice chat too. Thank you Lenka :)
5	Called about seat allocation as I prefer to talk than email and the lovely lucie F took my call and noticed a name problem on the booking. She then managed to sort this free of charge and emailed confirmation as promised. Great service! Never used this site before but will again. Thank you!
5	Aurelija was extremely helpful while helping to sort out an issue with the expiring date of my ID. That person really deserves a raise ;-).
5	My reservation was quickly sended to my email, but I had to change billing adress in my invoice, however, I contacted Skypicker on their website and they contacted me immediately on my email and day after, they sent me new invoice.
5	@bdeithrick Thank you for booking at Skypicker. We are happy that you like the deals we offer.
5	Many thanks to Nina Turkyan for prompt support and clear clarifications!
5	Just recently booked fly to Stockholm and had fantastic and very professional services from one of your travel consultant Olga Figol.As I did had a problem with my travel documents I call kiwi and within one hour  I received email and call back with confirmation.Definitely recommend to friends
5	I had some problems with boarding passes and have been helped out very well in a chat session by Viktor
5	Quick response and Excellent customer service from a travel consultant Selorm Ani-Frimpong...fantastic job!:)
5	The ticket reservation were pretty fast, and I got an immediate support by the guys out there.
5	Juan Costa ha resuelto mis problemas de descarga de tarjetas de embarque con una amabilidad y atención excelentes. Veo que esa empresa cuenta con profesionales de calidad como Juan, un muchacho atento y servicial en extremo. Cuiden de esta gente. Son los que hacen grande a una empresa de servicios como esta.
5	This is probably the best chat service I've had in my life. It took just a few minutes to change from the wrong name to the right one. Chan was really helpful. Will surely recommend!
5	Fast problem solving
2	Not using @skypickercom again. Misinforming has costly consequences. Implying that we are fabricating evidence. Not okay. Money back plz.
5	Called their customer service the other day, James T the customer service representative took care of everything for me
5	They are very serious and friendly!!!!
3	CUSTOMER DONT CARE WITH SKYFUCKERS
5	We are completely satisfied from <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>
5	I will definitely recommend skypicker to my friend. i had a booking from gold coast to manila and vice versa but had a problem with my return, since i had to stay longer in  manila, i have a conversation with Anna Alaxinova thru their live chat, and it was an excellent customer service, she tried her best to look for an alternative date and she even tried to give us the lowest price. it was a very pleasant experience. will be booking on the agency in the near future. oh and of all the travel agency i found online this is the cheapest one to fly to the Philippines., no hidden charges.:)
5	I discovered Skypicker by accident, but I see that it was a happy one. This is the best place to choose your flights, as they offer you a lot of possibilities and recommendations, not to forget the filters and the fact that they make the check in for you, not like at other companies.All in all, I would definitely recommend this website to anyone who is looking for the cheapest flights with minimum effort.
5	Very helpful service, I was helped through the chat, from Michaela O., to change my flights. Very satisfied of her assistance!
5	The company is great. The representative, Michaela, was extremely helpful and friendly. We are going to use this company again in the future.
5	I used Skypicker for a recent trip to Cuba, which required connecting flights.  I booked the trip at the last minute and based on research that I did on multiple sites, Skypicker offered the best deal and shortest wait time in between connecting flights.I will definitely use Skypicker for future trips.
5	My flight was cancelled for reasons beyond Kiwi's control (there was a strike), and the travel consultants I worked with--Miquel and Jana-- were so helpful. My options were limited due to my tight schedule, but Miquel and Jana did everything they could to get me to my destination on time. The best part, though, is that I felt like I was actually talking to humans (rather than a computer or automated service) at every step of the way.
5	I have been little bit sceptical about online chat support, but I was so wrong! Ky, the agent on duty has helped me to fill in my missing travel document id and therefore saved me from a big cost waiting for me at the airport. He was very polite, superhelpful and quick and made me start believe in proffessional support again :)
4	I have been buying tickets from Skypicker many times and I'm really happy about the service. Only once I experienced that I didn't get the e-tickets, but I called the customer support and within minutes I had the e-tickets in my mailbox. Keep up the good work, Skypicker!

5	It was the first time I was going to fly with Ryanair and I knew I had to be careful with the check-in and boarding pass. I was surprised that I didn't have to bother with anything because Skypicker did it all for me and I had the online check-in and all the 3 boarding passes, including the return trip, at least couple of days before my departure. All I had to do is print them and show on time. And my trips to London and back have gone smoothly :)
5	The service I received from Skypicker was very good, and I would definitely recommend the service to anyone. I got excellent help from Yussef in handling my bookings before traveling.
4	Very good service,
4	I just went through my booking and Will has been really helpful to get me there. Once I booked my flight, I reached David who was really helpful as well and accomodating. I'll follow up on the matter but so far I am really satisfied by the services I received. :)
5	"I have dealt with many booking companies and they just don't seem to care after the ticket is purchased. I worked with three people to resolve my credit card problem. None of them got frustrated with me and made me feel like I was still purchasing my ticket. It was only a luggage weight increase for 14 Euros but they treated me like I was spending a 1000 Euros. All Three agents ""Babak"", ""Lukas"", ""Aliaksandra"" over the last 24 hours we respectful and patient with me even though I was getting frustrated. This is hands down the best ticket booking agency, and in the login area you can add services so easy from adding a Pet to accompany you on the flight, to Ski gear, Insurance, food preferences, seating. I purchased the cheapest ticket, however, I was given options and services like I ordered first class. Kudos, <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> and all three agents Babak, Lukas and Aliaksandra"
5	I got great service from a very courteous customer service rep named Vally.  He was extremely persistent with the airline to change my ticket, and called me back multiple times to keep me posted, and get the job done.  I didn't expect this kind of service, and was very pleased.

5	Amazing work, fast response and great help. My flight was cancelled, so technical support contacted me by phone tor inform me and propose me an alternative flight. I really don't know the name of the amazing lady that explained me everything. But thank you! If you reading this! Also Dmitriy was a great help as I unknownly wrote some data wrong. He kindly helped me and fixed everything in a minute like a pro! I like your service, and I'm definitely gonna use it again. There are working fantastic people! Thank you all! Great job!
4	I was directed to <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> after using SkyScanner, and I found that it was a good overall experience. They checked in early on my behalf, allowing me to get good seats that I would not have otherwise been able to get.  One gripe though, is that it is difficult to pre-order meals ( it was an AirAsia X flight) because they had checked in on my behalf (Perhaps it was an oversight of mine) but the end result was that I had to purchase a meal inflight, which to be fair, was not too much of a problem.
5	Hi all! So this is going to be a long review!Ok, so you saw the 5 stars and like me before you, you are either believing I'm being paid to write this or that I'm a fake account! But let me reassure you that I'm completely 100% real human customer (or am I?).So I used Kiwi to book a flight to go to Reunion Island from Australia! Like you, I have been drawn by the seemingly unbelievable good deals that <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> offers! So I did a background check because you never know and anything above 10 dollars is worth being put through a background check, right? I completely disregarded the 5 stars comments (of course) and went straight to the 1 to 4 stars ones and let me tell you how distressed I was. Buuut as you guessed I went with it anyway.Let me tell you what happened to me. I looked for the cheapest flight available (Me? Stingy? Noooo), checked everything, contacted customer services via Live chat and was answered by Will! I stressed out on him, asking if it was a genuine website and all and generally speaking, rambling to him. I got in return patience, politeness and the informations I asked for and even more! (Long story short : I had to book before they could estimate the price of the luggage upgrade (and yes I asked about their refund and cancel policies))Then, I booked my flight, got back to customer service to David who was a babe as well (Am I being to forward here? Doesn't matter). I asked similar informations and all! Useless to say Kiwi customer service was holding my hand all along that ride and I wouldn't be surprise if they sighed when they saw my name pop up after the third time contacting them.In the mean time I got the promised e-mail back from Will about those estimated luggage fee and then later on, received an e-mail from Lucie giving me exact pricing! I then contacted Live chat customer service again! And this time it was Ramid (Please let it be the right way to spell it I forgot to write his name down) to check informations received from those e-mails and upgraded my luggages. And again, polite, really helpful!So I've done my travelling, Sydney --> KUL, then KUL --> Mauritius and Mauritius --> Reunion Island. I thought I would miss my flight while in KUL because of some kind of video being filmed and almost delaying the boarding time, I had Martin this time! And helpful as the Kiwi customer service got me used to, I've been reassured that another flight will be booked for me in the worst case scenario of me missing the next flight (I know, perspective).In conclusion, smooth traveling, no issues, everything worth knowing was written down for me. so yeah, 5 stars. I can't say this enough but customer services is there anytime. So you can't blame them for something they didn't tell you because you didn't ask. So lots of kudos for the persons I mentionned (Will, David, Lucie, Ramid, Martin)! I have to mention that, through being really involved in this review I just wrote, this is my experience with them and there are (or might be, I don't know) people out there whom have been wronged by this website, but as far as I'm concerned I am only talking about the customer services I was on the received end of.If I have to give any advices, contact them before booking if you have even the slightest doubt about something or specific requests. PLEASE. AND CHECK THREE TIMES EVERYTHING BEFORE BOOKING DAMN IT! :)Regards, Satisfied customers, (Except that I didn't book the meal for the KUL flight and didn't get any sticky rice thingy because I had a debit card only on me and no cash :/)
5	I made a mistake when booking a flight and contacted their help desk as soon as I realized it (a few days after booking..). Tomas Jurik and Elsa Claesen were very helpful and contacted the airline for me in order to correct my mistake, free of charge! I will definitely book through <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> again, great experience with them thus far
5	Used kiwi for the first time, Brussels to Barcelona. Couldn't believe the price we got for August. To be honest, I actually thought it might be a scam it was so cheap! Began looking around the website and found loads of cheap flights to amazing destination. The website is super easy to use...I love the anywhere option...when using that I found a round trip to Stockholm for 8 €!! Made me realize there were places I did not even know I wanted to visit...but at the price shown how could I not! Also, great flight combinations. Many in and out of same airport at reasonable time. Had to call about checking in. Waited less than 30 seconds for operator who was helpful and friendly. Already recommended to friends. Loved it!
5	I was skeptical cos I never heard of them before, but everything went smoothly, with a lot of reminder (no way you can be unprepared for your trip with them :p)
5	Nice looking website, easy to use, lots of options.Also, customer service is top notch, I spoke with Radim, who was super nice and helpful.
5	Get a lot of un-know information from Julie. She help me a lot to solve my problem for first using <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> for my holiday trip.
5	It is really easy and fast to find the best prices with Kiwi and to do the reservation from the begining until the end.
5	Quick response, all problems solved in a second. Thank you, Honza V.
5	Mariya Potello is an absolute credit to your company. A pleasure to talk with and answered all questions I had. I felt she went above and beyond to ensure I was happy with the service I received. Wish more customer services had her outlook!! Thanks Mariya!!
5	Agent Nizar was very helpful to arrange alternative connection when flight from Shanghai to Hong Kong was late and stranded my two daughters in the airport. Thanx.
5	Had a complicated short term (within 48 hours) booking involving flight in remote Central Asia, and received excellent support from Lucie G. on the online chat to resolve the matter within minutes - much appreciated and recommended.

1	January 17, 2017, we about 15 o'clock in the afternoon arrived at Havana's Jose Marti airport, to be registered on the flight IJ 0905 at 17:05 Havana-Cancun. Our tickets (booking code 1852171) were acquired in December 2016, 2 full ticket with two pieces of hand baggage and luggage each. The purchase price amounted to 13,212 rubles (over 200 USD total). But the front desk staff told that in the booking Alexander Fedorov is listed as a child (Infant), traveling with Elena Srapyan, and printed a confirmation: Kiwi paid Interjet only one adult place cost 81.95 USD, and no more payments on our booking to the airline have been reported. This error is not related to the airline, and is connected with the booking, we right there at the airport had to buy a new ticket in the office of Interjet for USD 224. How do you like it? We was totally angry. The only hope is that Kiwi will give us a refund.
5	Found the cheapest ticket on Kiwi website. First flight of my segmented flight (Antalya - Hamburg - Dublin) was delayed. Kiwi team (and especially Vladimir Fedorenko) did their best to update my booking and find the most suitable tickets for me and my wife. Everything was resolved quickly and free of charge. Give you 5 stars, guys!
5	I don't need to wait long to chat with somebody for assistance. It didn't even take me long to wait when I called on the phone. And they were very helpful and professional especially Eric, the staff I spoke to over the phone, he directed me on what to do, and in a minute my dilemma was solved. So happy with the assistance from kiwi. No LONG WAIT at all.
1	I am really disappointed by skypickers promised 24/7 support guarantee. I'm waiting for hours for a call back. Had to miss my flight due to easyjet and there is no effort to help me get a new flight. My trip was planned on a long sight and I already lost costs for transport and a hotel.Isn't it possible to find fastly a promised solution?!
5	I had not gotten my ID info on time and the online agent Petra was very helpful with submitting it for me.
1	I am sorry to say that skypicker are the worst booking agency I have ever dealt with. After confirming that they had made a booking upgrade and issuing me a  receipt for it.  They had said that they were sorry that they could fulfil the booking as error was made on their behalf and would not fulfil the booking as it would be at further cost to them. After speaking and emailing several people no effort was made by skypicker to fix the problem just a lot of sorries. I have found that they are very unprofessional by not even returning calls and saying seats where not available while I could clearly see that they available on the airline site. I will go directly to airline site in future and not bother with a booking agency and definitely not this one.
5	Online chat was clear, and quick. Explained things I needed to know. Thanks to Lukas, my online professional angel :)
5	Booking my flights through Skypicker exceeded my expectations. Everything run smoothly on the website during the booking process and all flights and check-in received on my email showing my boarding pass matched perfectly with the airlines' systems. I wish to congratulate Skypicker team for scoring it big, because rarely does one find such a perfect service online.
5	Thanks for the helg with the booking Yuriy!
5	Assistance was greatI had problems getting my email due to the fact that I inserted the wrong data.James was a great help to me. We got this over in just a few minutes
5	I had an excellent experience communicating through live chat with Kojo A. Support channel was pretty good as seconds after entering the chat, Kojo A. responded to me. Communication perfect, everything went smooth. My case of wrong title of the passenger during booking is still waiting to be processed from the airline, but I'm being positive that it will be changed as the agency was very very fast in response.Thank You for everything <http://Skypicker.com|Skypicker.com> and Kojo A. :)
5	i am  very satisfied with the service fillip help me alot i appreciate his help. thank you.
5	Tomas was really helpful getting my boarding pass
5	I had a problem with a delayed flight, but the <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> representatives acted efficiently and kindly to find another convenient flight. I am very grateful for the service they provided.

5	I'm so satisfied with the service.I had such a prompt and helpful chat with Danial.  I was so panic when I just realized that I'd taken a mistake of the misspelling for one name which of my friend's among the three. At that time I would like to change it. But I didn't know how can I do. So I'd mailed to Skypicker. Maybe after 1 hour, I received a phone call from Danial H.(customer service). He had checked the problem and asked for the copy of passport in order to correct the misspelled name. He said my reservation has been confirmed and the E ticket was sent to my email address. So he will sent the copy to the airline and will keep me informed once the name is corrected. After a few minutes,. Danial H. offered to fix it straight away. Thank you Skypicker! and Danial!!Everything was great! I've used a lot of travel agent website. But the service of Skypicker is extremely fast and friendly. I would definitely recommend Skypicker for any traveler and I'll book again with SkypickerThank you so much to Skypicker team and Danial H.Best regardsHYEWON KIM
5	Very good customer service! Easy to reach and talk to. Monika, Jana and Giorigi assisted me in my matter and they were very kind and helpful. I recommend this company and I will not hasitate to use <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> again for my future travels.
5	Daniel was an amazing help to me and answered all of my questions promptly and with patience.  10 out of 10 would recommend to anyone thinking of travelling through them.  It's comforting to know they are here to help 24/7 incase of any mishaps. Thank you Daniel you are AMAZING!!! :)
5	after 10 minuts finally got him ! :D
5	DENIS did best job, giving me a best service he can, after my big mistake. I was swearing, shouting, because i couldnt get my payment confirmation email, because i taped it bad. So he was explaining me everything, and he did it well.Good job Bud
4	I am very satisfied with the help provided by one assistant, Neil. I was worried about the check-in online that it's recommended to do 72 hour before flying, or else some extra cost may be charged at the airport, up to 280€ .. Via life chat, which is a perfect channel, i was assisted, gave the needed data for the check-in online, and it was made in a breeze. So my worries went away and the impression about skypicker is high.
5	This is my first experience booking my flight using Kiwi. com service. After getting confirmation, there are so many questions in my mind that need to be answered, so I went to  Kiwi  and just live chat with Aliaksandra. She gave me polite and fast response. Thank you for your service Aliaksandra. Thank you Kiwi
4	I was having difficulty finding an affordable flight home I was just looking for a one way ticket from Tokyo and every website I checked was giving me options of tickets over a thousand dollars which is ridiculous. I stumbled upon skypicker and was able to find a very reasonable ticket. They saved me a lot of money and the airlines I flew with were very nice. Singapore air and then virgin air. I will definitely be using this site again in the future.
5	Very reliable site! And the people so helpful! I had a problem with my e-mail address and a person whose name is Vendula, helped me immediately!!
1	I am completely shocked by the poor level of customer service when it comes to rescheduling a flight. I will definitely not be recommending kiwi to anyone I know or any other traveler I meet along the way in Asia.I contacted this company 5 days before the flight we intended to take with the intention of rescheduling it well before the 48 hour deadline.The problems that I incurred were as followed:-they take a long time to get back to you-they take a long time to answer any questions or concernsIm still out 250$ USD and the time I spent trying to resolve this issue, which apparently, is a complete waste because even if you try and resolve it early it wont do you any good.On a side note, they sent me an email saying Air Asia would not allow such a flight change on the 5th day well past the deadline. Why do you give me an option to reschedule with any flight if you tell me Air Asia will not allow it. Why did you waste my time for 5 days when I could've tried rescheduling my credit for another flight.DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR YOUR MONEY. DO NOT USE KIWI.
5	I had a problem with my check-in. Fahd helped me and in a couple of minute he solved everything. Recommended!
5	Great customer service! I haven't used the ticket yet but as an American the website and quick response times are impressive. The price is almost unbelievable. Good job guys!
5	The best company! A reliable company! Customer Support 24/7 !!! I am very pleased with the service !!! I recommend to all !!!
5	Vlad is a total professional, felt like he was smiling behind his screen while giving me info.
5	I was late with my check in! It was my fault! I called the number that I found in my e-mail and Roman solved all of my problem! So thank you very much ROMAN for your help! I hope this will never happen again!! Thanks kiwi!

5	Natali was super helpful in correcting a mistake in my booking. Highly recommended
5	Just received a great customer service experience by the kiwi.com.The gentleman that was helping me his name is Roman. I have accidentally put the wrong details when booking the ticket online. After realizing that I have called the customer services and Roman was really friendly and helpful. He called me back on my moblie after calling the airline for me and changed the details for me free of charge, I thought I would have to pay as most of the budget airline needs to. So thanks very much for that !
5	tereza and david offered a very good service to me, they helped me alot!
5	Great customer service! Would recommend to anyone wanting to get cheaper flights
5	I spoke to Michal on the live chat for 10 mins and he saved me some money. He was friendly and helpful... the website is easy to use. Great!!
5	I've made an order on Skypicker, and I was going to fly by lowcosts. Skypicker service had made all the check-ins for me, so I didn't need to do this manually by myself on airlines' websites. I really love this feature since it saves a HUGE amount of time.I didn't have a chance to talk to Skypicker's support, since I didn't need any additional help.Thanks for a great service.
5	i love skypicker. and Ondra.. thanks to you a lot. :).. who help me out. really fast responding. chat and ticket issued.. thanks Ondra.. lovely skypicker.
5	Thank you Aurelia for all your help today. Would recommend  to everyone
5	It is excellent for book flights online. it is very accurate and trusted site
5	Booking very simple; the company even takes care of your checking inn, boarding pass automatically sent by e-mail. When an airline cancelled part of our travel, Skypicker very smoothly created a new itenerary, to our full satisfaction. The companys way of communication is superb. In short: I can recommend this company in all respects.
4	I had made a mistake when booking in regard to asking for incorrect baggage allowance. I made contact on line and Lilia Kharchenko fixed the problem with no hassles at all. Thank s Lilia
5	Agent Tamara .. she is very kind and fun ..thank u so much
1	"I carefully read every term and condition on their website before booking my flight. I read their ""<http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> guarantee"" so many times that I have parts of it memorized. When it came to cancelling and/or rebooking my flight due to a family emergency, I was completely shut out. The live chat agent that I spoke to said that the <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> guarantee does not apply with all airlines, why isn't this stated in the fine print? Now I am left with a non refundable flight and unnecessary stress when their guarantee promised me the complete opposite. I am unhappy with the service I've received, I've reached out to their company and am now patiently waiting for a reply. I have never experienced this with any other booking site I have used. I would not recommend <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>. Save your money and book elsewhere! Save yourself the headache."
1	I want to start off by saying that I have never wrote a negative review for the sole reason that everyone makes mistakes and there is no need to speak bad on their behalf because on a single mistake...knowing that, let’s get this party started.The experience that I had with <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> was undoubtedly the absolutely WORST experience I’ve had with a customer service desk let alone an airline in my life. It was the waterboarding of service. I admit, I made a mistake on the ticket name and needed a correction to ensure my sister would be able to make the flight. When asking for this correction Kiwi wanted to charge me an exorbitant amount of money (750 EUR) but claimed that this fee was a result from the airlines (WestJet & JetStar) charging a ticket re-issuing fee for the ticket? Now, I understand that there would be a fee, but come on. So I took it upon myself to call the airlines and have this taken care without the help of Kiwi and their boarder line non-existent customer service. After a 5 minute conversation with JetStar I had the name correction completed free of charge. West Jet required Kiwi to make the phone call due to the fact that it was booked by them. I’m going to save you what was a dozen more phone calls and little hair I have left but I can only describe it as Kiwi actively trying to make this process harder.Thankfully, I know how to use a phone and WestJet customer service actually knows how to do their job so I was able to get my little sister home and have the name corrected on the ticket for 0$ as this was the policy for BOTH WESTJET AND JETSTAR! So thank you for letting me know how bad service can actually be, I guess the silver lining is that at least I won’t have to go through an experience like this again unless I’m captured by ISIS of course. I will make it my life goal to ensure that anyone I know and love or anybody with a pulse and a credit will avoid your agency. I will spread this gospel throughout the land and pray that one day people will know that absolute sloth that is <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>.Other than that, I really do hope you have an amazing day!
4	Skypicker already checked us in for our flight. We had no problems!
3	Check with my email address. <mailto:ayyoobkpfujairah@gmail.com|ayyoobkpfujairah@gmail.com>
1	"I have had the worst experience attempting to work with Skypicker. I booked a flight 2 months in advance, received email confirmation of the booking and then 5 days later received the following email:We apologize to inform you that the price of your ticket has changed while your booking was being processed and we are not able to finish your order. Since cheap seats are limited for each flight, the carriers might change the price of your order very quickly. Unfortunately we cannot affect such cases and we are not able to avoid them.You ordered your flight for (265.22)€ and the new price is (329.31 )€. The price difference is (64,09) €.There are two options how to deal with this unpleasant situation:You can pay the price difference: If you agree with this price increase please contact us. We will send you a PayPal invoice to settle the price difference. As soon as your PayPal invoice will be paid, we will finish the booking process and send you the booking confirmation. You can ask for order cancellation: If you do not agree with this price increase, we will refund whole your payment for the booking and you will receive it back within the next 7-10 working days.Please let us know about your decision as soon as possibleWe apologize for the inconvenience it caused you.Thank you for your understanding and cooperation!Best regards,Igor TarasuikYour Skypicker team<http://Skypicker.com|Skypicker.com>::: At which point I responded that I would like a full refund and then promptly rebooked flights as it is a busy time of year and they were selling out quickly.The following day I received the following email:Regarding e-mail which you received yesterday at 11:35AM, we are sorry for the inconvenience, but it was sent by technical mistake, that e-mail was related to another booking. We have been trying to reach you via phone and explaine possible solution, you can find this information below:You have made reservation 366980 with two flights From: CEB (Cebu) To: MNL (Manila) and MNL (Manila) To: USU (Busuanga) on 28-29 of December for $ 174.16. 30 minutes after your request, we have provided you with E-ticket which is confirmation of your reservation. Unfortunately, low cost airlines in general do not provide the possibility of cancellation and we can’t go beyond airline’s policy in order to provide you with a full refund. However, we can applying for a tax refund. We contacted the airlines and they informed us that it is possible to get back 77 USD for the flight MNL (Manila) To: USU (Busuang) and 8 USD for the flight CEB (Cebu) To: MNL (Manila). Therefore total amount that is possible to return is 85 USD. Please inform us if you agree with cancellation and we will make request to the airlines.Thank you for your understanding!Best regards,Igor TarasuikYour Skypicker team<http://Skypicker.com|Skypicker.com>::: At this point they are still refusing to refund me stating that ""As it is stated in our terms and conditions we have a non-refundable pricing policy and therefore if you wish to cancel your flight we are unable to offer you a refund, even if you are unwell."" and are offering me the option to book another flight at a later date and pay all the change fees and difference in fare, however, I live in the US and will not be traveling again in the Philippines anytime in the near future.Also, the only way of contacting me is via a Ukraine phone number and do not have toll free numbers and the customer service representatives are quite rude and unwilling to work with you over the phone. They actually will not look up anything over the phone (even though they call relentlessly) and tell you that they will ""look things up"" and email you what they find.At this rate I don't even trust that I will arrive to the Philippines and have flights booked via this company that have been confirmed. Even if  they managed to book my new flights correctly I would highly recommend using another company to book if at all possible."

4	I buy a lot of tickets, and I can recommend Skypicker. You allways get help when you need it, and fast. Today I got help from a nice lady called Beck.Thank you :-)
4	Am happy to recommend <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com>. Lusine was very helpful and very patient. I was upset about something that went wrong due to oversight but Lusine fixed it for me very patiently. She was of great help and knows her job well as she did not keep me me waiting. Thank you Lusine. It is bcos of staff like you that makes business prosper
5	I got help with my online check in. It went great, I didn't have to wait much and Sara, the operator was really kind and helpful!
5	<http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> assembles the most efficient and inexpensive itinerary available from multiple carriers, if needed. Highly recommended.
4	I have not travelled yet but they have helped me with everything I have needed. I hope everything goes well and I have no problem with my additiona luggage. Zdenka has helped me a lot with this operation.
5	I just had a fantastic experience speaking to Issis Castro via the live chat option on SkyPicker.  It was quick, easy and stress free.  I really appreciate good customer service and this could not have been a smoother process.  Thanks!
4	Wow. <https://t.co/ALiEJDvuiq> is awesome for flexible traveling! Finally!
5	Thank you skypicker for your service. Although it wasn't your fault that my flights were canceled, you got other tickets to get me home. Trip was longer then expected but at least i didnt stayed in Toronto because of canceled flights.Thanks to everyone of your team who wrote emails, searched alternative flights, phoned, answered questions and were patient. You proved that human person is priority for you instead of others!Thank you.
5	After looking at the cheaper airlines and not finding 'cheap' I tried Skypicker and they came up with a combination that was cheaper and flew me back on the airlines that I would have used, just at a better price. Will use again.
5	I was satisfied with the live chat, when i wanted to ask some questions and Anna T. was very nice and helpful
5	I used the live chat to ask some questions regarding my boarding passes. Got awesome service from Sam! Polite, fun and helpful! Thumbs up!
5	Very good service.
5	Helpful people, sorted us right out when we were in a flight cancellation disaster - am recommending them to everyone!
5	Chat with Alex for some changes needed to be done with my booking.Very patient in handling my request.Although I dont know what the resolution of my booking will be, I'm glad to know that the company is going to contact the airline straight to see what can be done to help me.This extra effort means the world to customers :)
1	I flew from Manila to Tokyo and had a layover in Hong Kong. My flight from Manila was delayed resulting in my missing the boarding for the Hong Kong flight. It was midnight and so I just bought the first ticket that was available to Tokyo from Hong Kong. Of course because it was so last minute, it was expensive.When I contacted Kiwi about the matter I requested a refund of the new ticket I bought. They told me they would look into it and if the Manila flight had indeed been delayed, they would refund me.Nearly three weeks passed with no action. Every time I asked for an update they said they still could not confirm the information. Finally, they said that because they could not confirm with the airline in Manila that there had been a delay, they would not give me the refund. Finally, I was cursorily cut off with the flight agents from Kiwi telling me it was MY duty to provide proof the flight had been delayed—more than a month after the flight! As though the agents had not done anything in that entire time period that left me anything I could do! But obviously there had been a delay, or why would I have had to buy a new ticket? I had provided documentation of the new ticket as well. Tl;dr, long wait for reply, no action took, still no refund. Thanks a lot, Kiwi.
5	Very helpful and fast, it was Miroslava who contacted me.
5	Very good service. Friendly and competent staff via the Hotline. Fast solution to the problem.
5	Great customer service! Made a mistake while filling the passengers information. Everything was fine after a nice 5 minutes call with a sociable girl called Kira. Thumbs up! Keep up the good work guys!
1	I was recently traveling from Puerto Escondido to Mexico City on a flight arranged through SkyPicker.  The original Skypicker flight was on VivaAerobus leaving PXM at 12:40...it actually left at 8am.  I was not the only Skypicker customer who arrived for the flight only to discover that it was an earlier departure.  Neither the other party nor I received any information that the flight was changed.  Here are the receipts for the Aeromar flight that I had to purchase at the gate for the flight from Puerto Escondido to Mexico City on April 2nd. In fact, SkyPicker to this day is unaware of this schedule change.  Be careful.  It cost me an additional $3,723.00 MXN pesos to book a different flight.  OH, AND BY THE WAY...IF YOU WRITE TO CUSTOMER SUPPORT SERVICE...be ready for them to distance themselves from any responsibility.  I literally had 10 minutes to book a flight on a different airline on the last daily flight out and they maintain that I should have contacted them IMMEDIATELY at that time. AND, they invoked a random 2 week period when I should have registered the complaint with them (i contacted them 28 days later).  THEY SUCK.
5	I might miss my flight In Gatwick and Dorota will help me rebook it if I do miss it, she was so nice and helpfull :)
5	When you book flights at an excellent price, you wonder how things will pan out when something goes wrong. Well, Kiwi were truly impressive. My daughter - travelling home to the UK from Bangkok via Stockholm -  missed her connecting flight because of a delay in Thailand. Kiwi immediately agreed to find her an alternative. As it turned out, timing issues meant they were unable to book her on the next flight online so they told her to buy a ticket which they would refund.The claims process was quick and simple and Kiwi were true to their word.This was the first time any of us in the family had used Kiwi and we will definitely use them again. Great experience. Highly recommended.
5	Excellent dealing with <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>. I had some issues that I needed answered and Georgia was so helpful! I even had a broken phone with terrible reception and she was very patient with me. She answered all my questions quickly and politely. I will definitely continue to use this company!
1	I made a reservatiom for tickets at € 1,306(we are big family-8 person).And i changed the date of flight. They had me to pay €1,542.I thought that the difference(€236= €1,542-€1,306) is extra charges.But they say ' due to our non-refundable policy, it is not possible to refund the money for the original ticket'so they had me to pay total  €2,848.it's not cancellation, it's just change!If i buy new tickets, it is cost just  € 1,306(it is less than  €1,542)And there isn't detailed description of that on skypicker's websiteI bought two company's ticket.(ryanair,  vueling)so i research ryanair,  vueling's website.They show the change fee(for exemple, vueling shows 'Change your flight for just €45 per passenger each way')Two company have no policy about forfeit of first flight fee at the change of flight. just it need extre charge.( €45 per person)I complaind about that, and skypicker mailed me 'We have contacted with Ryanair and Vueling airlines and unfortunately, as we already informed you it is not possible to get a refund from them as they have non-refundable policy as we do.'it's true? i don't believe. it's just change of flight date, but skypicker had me to pay excessive amount €1,542.what can i do? it's our family first trip. it's terrible.i never use skypicker. how about you?
5	second time using the service. the process is smooth, esp. connecting discount airlines such as wizzair and ryanair.
2	A startup that finds discount flight tickets 'hidden' on airline websites just launched in the US <https://t.co/wazvHfA8tZ>
5	Excellent cooperation,with Venda!:-)
5	HERE'S A TIP airasia has the cheapest flights. if not, check cebupac for korea. for japan, raid orbitz or skypicker nonstop LOL
5	Before I find Skypicker, I used Azuon, but it wasn't online and free.Skypicker knows the same, fast and free online scanner for low cost flights.I recommend it!
2	well.. I wish to spend a few lines of congratulations for the service received by Skypicker staff.
5	Perfect as no need worry about check in.
5	Had a small problem when flying with VietJetAir but I think this was the fault of the airline who made us buy extra baggage at the airport despite the fact we had clearly booked enough beforehand. Otherwise, this site is easy to use and encountered no problems. Thanks.
5	Had to update my passport details, just had to talk to an agent and that was it. James was really helpful and kind, efficient on top of all! That made the experience great! Definitely recommend it!
3	Lucie KambovaI was pleased with her approach and assistance, She was swift, kind and to the point. However the problem did not get solved. The original booking has never been confirmed and the passenger was left behind.
5	Super thanks to KATE who helped me solve a problem with my reservation. Super fast, nice and helpfull. Thanks kate! keep up the nice work
4	I used Kiwi chat to solve the problem of allowing one checked bag on a  flight I reserved , as the website did not allow me to. (Technical issue?)Huriyat answered all my questions promptly and was able to rectify the problem of being able to add the checked bag in a timely manner.This will be my first time using <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>. Will see how it goes once in the country where the flight is booked for. I do not know how the price compares to booking directly with the airline, as I did not check that out first.Thanks.
5	Great customer service so far :)Had a problem with payment due to blocking of some scripts and booked again.Then i asked in live chat if there have been two bookings and the agent Nikola was a great help!!!Everything fine :)
5	Bogdan was helpful. I have my booking confirmed 2 hours after talking to him. Thanks
5	questions were answered promptly and security to avoid credit card fraud is the best. We tried Sky Picker as a last minute flight arrangement and got my wife the quickest flight as any other company at $300.00 less than the cheapest competitor. I highly recommend them for those on a budget or for those that just want to save money.
1	Terrible - avoid like a Donald Trump hairstyle. En-route from Varanasi to Kathmandu via Delhi, they booked me onto a flight from Delhi that had ceased operating two months earlier! They were then unable to book me onto an alternative (existing) flight, which I had to book out of pocket, and simply offered compensation by way of the original (imaginary) flight cost. Their suggestion that I could catch another flight the next day, at overnight cost to myself, reflects that they really don't care about their terms and conditions. No consideration for gross inconvenience to me, failure of their contract of supply (not to mention gross incompetence), and compensation or support for the fact that I had received no service at all in-line with what they had sold.
5	Hello i received a really great customer service by her, and im really thankfull for that
1	Booked my flight through them, and the problem was that I needed to change the date for the flight back. Called The agency and they said they will call the flight companies (I was supposed to fly with two different companies for the return trip) on my behalf in order to change the dates. Later on I got a call back saying that they've checked with 1 out of the 2 companies and they don't have flights on the desired date. However, I checked myself that the other company HAS more than one flight for the date I wanted, so I asked them to check with them also (which they should have done in the first place). 24 hours passed, no call or email or anything. Never trust them or you will find yourself paying more than whatever discount the promise to offer. Worst service. Or better said no service at all
5	Great service offering high transparency and reliability.
1	"First off, I will take take responsibility for the initial mistake, and this review is about customer service.I mistakenly entered the wrong date for the ticket- its on behalf of someone flying to see their dying sister- and my mind was distracted. I put in the Monday a week after I intended, and as there was only one screen I hit ""submit"" then 20 minutes later realized my mistake. I called, & was informed that there was absolutely no way at all to refund my money even in the least.I understand policies, but for a truly honest mistake especially good customer service is to try to make your customers happy. The inflexibility of this company when it comes to customer service is why I will not be using them again."
5	i had the pleasure of being helped by Lucie Kmbova and she solved my problem quickly. it would have been simpler if i could change the flight details myself on the site, but this was the next best thing.
5	I had Lenka help me with purchasing check luggage option and it was so smooth and quick.Extremely happy!
5	I had a problem with my flight and instead of just of just getting the refound, the support team helped me to find a new perfect flight for me. I think it is great when services company take care of the costumer offering different options and solutions. Thank you!
2	This was the worst booking experience I've ever had.  I booked a flight last night and right after I booked I realized I put bin the wrong date. My mistake,  yes.  I called within 4 minutes of booking and was assured that I could switch the flight within 24 hours.   They sent a few emails telling me to be patient and they were working on it.  Then I received an email at 3 am telling my in had to confirm before 5 am if I wanted a refund.   I called as soon as I woke up and they said it was too late and it is going to cost $500 to change.  The flight was only $300.   I am still not past the 24 hour period but now they say that was a mistake.  The people were kind on the phone but staff was just poorly trained and didn't have much knowledge of the rules.  Had they told me I needed to be up all night for emails I would have set an alarm .  They also had my phone number but didn't bother to call.  They thought I'd rather sleep and the $500 charge would be fine with me.   Their mistakes cost me $300.   I will never book with them again.
4	There will always be negatives but my support is based on kind. Neil provided me with excellent support and assistance when I was badly let fown by #JetstarAustralia.
4	Natalya P,I will thank you so much for the service you provided due to our booking problems.We are now looking forward to do our trip without problem at all  :-)RegardsOla M Solberg
5	Got locked out of my hotmail for logging in on a friends computer, had no access to my flight details, Martina was a huge help and had them re sent to another email. Great customer service.
5	Very fast help from Bek, thank you very much :)
5	This isn't so much of a review as it is one of gratitude and knowing I selected the right company. I'm flying to Europe to study abroad and was worried I would not be able to have enough weight limit to properly pack. I asked Jan Lukasek my service representative and while there was no immediate solution Jan assured me that Kiwi would be on the phones with EasyJet in trying to get me the extra allowance. It's the little things that matter and the dedication to customer service but most of all the great attitude Jan showed. Jan is more than an employee to Kiwi, Jan should be considered an asset! Thank you for the marvelous work you all do! 10/10 Will Recommend to all my friends and family.
5	Booked a return trip within Europe, which included stopovers. Very easy to compare flight prices and options. I was able to find an excellent price for my trip (about £80 cheaper than I expected!). The booking process was very straightforward. All boarding passes were correct and emailed to me on time. No problems at all. Very satisfied!
5	I was looking for an air-ticket of a domestic route.  SkyPicker offered about half of the cost of all the others.  In addition, the process was so simple and customer friendly.  I strongly recommend.
5	It is a pleasure and makes a difference to be able to contact with a nice customer service representative that is helpful in solving your queries.Filip was fast and helped me to understand if I needed to change certain information on my reservation.The whole chat service and attention from Filip makes me recommend the booking with <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>.There are few things that distinguish all these companies that offer relatively cheap flights, but having the chance to talk with someone and get help when you need it is a big one.
5	So fast and good service i had..!i had problems with my checkin and one guy James solve my problem..he was my hero in this evening..thanks a lot James!
5	Martin Carter, thank you for lettng all this happen and extra thanks to Graeme Fairweather who went extra steps to obtain all the necessary info we need to know before we gonna depart for our vacay. Cheers mate, take care!
5	I've booked a flight from Malaysia to Philippines but I was unable to confirm my personal data due to a website error (I assume).However I've been contacted by Eleonora and Eugene who helped me out and eventually managed to update my data.Moreover I received the mail translated to Italian (my mother tongue) which is something I wouldn't expect but I think it is extremely important and essential to people who don't speak English fluently.These are some of the little things that make the difference.Thank you again.
4	Abigail helped me to check in on line he did a good job
3	@Starrvinnius Please find the button for live chat in the lower left corner. <https://t.co/PD6QF6R1yP>
5	I bought with <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> and I've had a wonderful experience, my two kids were traveling alone and I was very worried because they didn't have cellphone with them and I didn't know if they were ok and if they had taken the right plane, so I contacted Kiwi chat and agents (LUKAS P and ALIAKSANDRA) help me calling the airline so I could know they were ok and they got the right flight. thanks so so much to these agents. I highly recommend <http://KIWI.COM|KIWI.COM>
5	We have made a big mistake - have bought non-refundable tikets for a wrong date! It was terrible, i didn't expect that there was another way except buying new tikets. But we found airline's rules and asked Kiwi if they could help us. And our problem was solved! Great thanks to Kira K. (Кира К.), who made a lot of calls to airline and helped us with date changing without high cost!
5	The excellent service rendered by Michaela Daneckova and Paulina to change my flight makes me want to use <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> for all my future flight bookings. They were very friendly, helpful and very prompt in rendering their service. I will also recommend my other friends to use your services.Thank you ladies.Chandra Jayaram from Malaysia
3	Skypicker its a great finder flights conexions, but i had some problem with the WizzAir company that didnt allow me to aboard the flight, and i had to buy another ticket with another company.There is kind of missunderstood behind companies, they dont know the final destination when making these scales.Besides that, everything was perfect.
5	i will do that. i like how you provide alternative options for your customersI can sense Mohammed is very well trained with customer service.
5	I had some problems with my boarding passes and my agent  Lukas Janecka solved everything in a couple of minutes. I'm super happy of the service, thank you!
5	Very helpful service!  I thougt I put in all my documentnumbers but it turned out I didn't (don't know why). I was phoned by Skypicker, didn' catch the call but got the message with another telephone number and other possibilities to fix the issue. I called, and Irene Zhuk helped me get the things done and also sent me a confirming  email afterwards. Difficult to get lost whith this service!
4	I find out it was a reliable site to order tickets for my trip. U can trust them. And that's it. I had no problem, so I don't know how they deal with them.
4	i had problems entering my passport details so i couldnt recieve my boarding pass. after going on the livechat, this problem was fixed within a minute by a friendly person named Aliz. thank you so much
1	My bording pass for Ryanair isn't coming. This company is a liar.
3	Booked a trip via kiwi to Salalah.However after it took my money out, it couldnt book my flight and asked me to pay extra! this was really unpleasent since it already took my money initially and I don't have the funds to book elsewhere, I was forced to pay an extra considerable amount of money to get my tickets. I will be very cautious in the future when booking with <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>
5	Huge shoutout to Jan Lukasek who was very helpful during my most recent customer service experience with Kiwi. I had a couple of questions on my upcoming flight, and Jan was very friendly and very fast at answering my questions. I'm feeling confident about choosing Kiwi to book my tickets.
3	See him, took me about 25 sec
4	@skypicker Hi, I'd be interested in acquiring your Twitter username 'skypicker', please contact me via Twitter Direct Message to hear more!
5	My name is Vincent Roy, and I just received an excellent service over the phone just now from your staff Eric. Eric was extremely polite and patient from the very beginning of the call. He was very helpful and answered all my questions, going beyond the usual customer service experience I usually receive over the phone. Great service, thank you. Vincent Roy
5	SkyPicker found the best prices and more convenient flying tickets combo for me, followed by greatly timed, clear instruction emails with all the documentation needed. Will be using them for my flying needs!
5	I'm a first time international traveler. Great help for clearing up my mistakes.
5	Miquel was very kind and professional!!! a person that really makes a difference!
4	I was a bit hesitant about using Skypicker for the first time, partly because their possible flights were cheaper for a last minute flight at a difficult time (HCMC to Sydney with Air Asia).However, they delivered for the price, although it meant a difficult flight with baggage rechecked at two stopovers (KL and Denpasar). The Indonesian stopover was awful, but that isn't Skypicker's fault.It wasn't made abundantly clear that this was some sort of composite booking that needed the collection and rechecking of baggage, but in the end it was worth it, because Skypicker was able to calculate a cheap fare from the hassle. Better than some other aggregate sites.One nice thing. I got a real phone call in Australia from Skypicker (Czech Republic?) that there was a potential issue with the booking pass which they had checked in on the last leg going back. It wasn't a problem in the end, but it was good service that they rang about it.I will certainly look at them again, along with other sites to see who has the best balance of time and cost on their flights.
4	I used the <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> aka <http://skypicker.com|skypicker.com> for the first time this year.The website worked like a charm and it was easy to find the flights I was looking for. I was realy surprised that the fusion between these two companies worked this smoothly – great job in the background.After my trip I had to contact the live chat and hat some good minutes with Lukas. Not yet the answer I was looking for but the first steps are lined up and set up as far as they could (now It’s all up to the carrier).
5	Quick answer, changing booking
5	Made the booking in a few clicks. The only thing I would suggest for improvement would be offering the chance of checkin online to clients so that they won't have to print the boarding tickets.
1	LOTS OF PROBLEM! BE CAREFUL WITH UR CARD!! ITS DOUBLE DEBIT! AND MORE THEN 500% OVERLIMIT..
4	Hello, I was on chat with Jana due to my boarding passes for my today's flight, I was bit in panic but it was not problem at all. Jana assisted me very proffesionally and I received my boarding passes immediately.Thank you very much for that!
4	Thanks to Jonathan who was very understanding and helpful in my situation. While we weren't able to find an affordable solution, Jonathan worked really hard to assist me, exploring several different avenues to try to get around the problem. I would still happily go with Skypicker again, as I certainly felt that they valued me as a customer.
5	I just discovered this site and it's absolutely amazing, everything's clear, and they're very reactive when you call on the phone, very understanding, and managed the best out a of my issue !Thank you very much ! From now on, I will always buy my tickets through you !
1	We used <http://skypicker.com|skypicker.com> for the first time and will DEFINITELY be the last. To cut a long painful ordeal short. We ended up missing our flight after a 5.5 hour delay and a unannounced gate change at 3:30am. The airline agreed with us and said that they would fully refund our ticket because they had a policy that any flight delayed over 3 hours the flight could be refunded or modified. The airline told us all we needed was skypicker's registered email and phone number. So we contacted Skypicker and Initially the agents totally confirmed that yes we could get a refund and/or modify the flight.....well that  story soon changed to well we are so sorry WE CAN NOT!!. For the next 4 hours we received the complete run around from this company. Agents were rude and would often disconnect us from the chat. So at the end of the day they left my family and I stranded. Please do a search on the internet ( or just scroll down on this page) for others who have reviewed this company - these negative reviews are all VERY true. Use at your own peril.
5	they were very helpful
5	Booked my flight at the best available price and when i forgot to check in on time, Jiri was there to help me avoid extra costs at the airport!
5	I haf some problems with my booking due to late check in. While at the airport i got in contact with Samaél via livechat, who swiftly, easily and smooth made sure i was checked in for my other flights, aswell as resending my boardingpasses. So thumbs up to good support.
5	Excellence Service via Live Chat. Patrik Pivoda helped me a lot. In just a couple of minutes all my problems were gone.Thanks again!
5	Rebecca C. a brillant girl and she resolve my problem very quiclky and well. Thank you again!
5	me gusto mucho este servicio son muy amables y eficientes resolvieron mi problema a tiempo les recomiendo este servivcio muy bueno.....!
3	When there are multiple airports around a city, please note users of this more clearly than merely stating the airport code. Paying €17 for bus transport to- and from the destination defeats the purpose of €5 plane tickets ;-)And yes, it's perhaps our own responsibility to check this, but we were not the only ones who had this happen, we met two other ladies on the flight that had the same thing happen to them.
5	My customer experience with <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> was amazing.  I made a mistake in my booking dates.  Petra, my customer support agent, was able to secure an alternative itinerary within about an hour. Petra was patient,  concise,  and eager to help! You are in good hands! Cheers, Josh
1	If you are travelling with an infant or child. Do not use this site. I paid for 3 adult tickets (Kiwi allows you to only select the number of passengers and not children or infant.) However, when I checked with the airline (Air Asia and Jetstar) directly, KIWI has registered for 2 adults and 1 infant (2 seats) instead of the 3 adults seats that I wanted and paid for. Book direct from the airlines' online sites. It is usually cheaper and more definite. For this matter, I had to buy another ticket (adult) direct from the airlines. When I called Kiwi, they claimed that I have only paid for 2 adults and 1 infant. Do consider other more established online booking site or agents.
5	thansk for support me :D
5	Got the most amazing service from the skypicker team 24 hours!Thanks to Aleksandra Mrzyglod and Kira K.for their help and assistance you are the best!
4	And a special thanks to Seth - the super helper :-)
5	Delayed flight with no chance to catch connection flight.Lucie O'Bryan, the agent with who i spoke, makes everything possible to solve my issue. AND SHE DID IT!The best agent thst i've speek!
1	@skypickercom sorry but except for the boarding pass I have not received anything with regards to refund- please can u check again thanx
5	I used the chat to solve an issue. Mrs Lucie O'Bryan was fast, kind and extremely useful. I'm satisfied.
5	<http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> provides excellent service, no matter at what point of your booking. The web page is very user-friendly and as simple as possible. The booking confirmation sent by mail looks neat and gives a great overview of your trip. Adding extra luggage to my booking was the simplest thing! Kiwi tries to excel at every touchpoint with the customer. Highly recommended!
5	Mohammed was simply an amazing help over the phone. He was clear and articulate. Mohammed was very helpful over an issue regarding a travel booking.
5	My name is George Georgios and i was really happy with how quick and easy it was to deal with staff members of your chat service,special thanks to Neil as he solved my issue with no frustrations at all,keep the good work up buddy

5	James was awesome!! He helped me so much and refunded me the amount that I was charged in excess because of the baggage! Really recommend him!
5	Patrik from Costumer service solved my issues extremely fast, I wish you all the best :)
4	Thanks for your quick answer and for sending the boarding passes. I wish I hadn't had to ask for them for you to send them, though.The service provided by Daniele Livrieri was useful and he helped me a lot. Grazie.
5	I needed extra baggage and chat with a very friendly woman named Petra M. She help me in a very good way, and give very good service. From Line Moller

5	Jiri Cervenka is one of the best online support managers i have met. He was very helpful in horrible situation and solved the problem immediatelly even the his working hours was over.The rest Skypicker support manager should take an example from JIRI because they were not such quick ;)Best wishes from Lithuania
5	I used kiwi for my reservation for Barcelona. I got wrong my e-mail. I spoke to consultant IRINA online who was kind enough to help me and solved everything. Thank you kiwi and IRINA for the help. Please show lots of love to such a good employee.
5	I didn't received your email. Kindly forward one more time
5	Great service. Great commitment to be helpful and its truly appreciated
5	I made a mistake on my passport expiration information for an international flight (Yikes!) So I contacted the live chat support on SkyPicker. I was immediately answered by Phana, she calmed me down and assured me that the problem was easy to fix. 2 minutes later she sends me a smiley face saying it was all updated. Relief!! So much relief!! Thank you Phana!! :) <3
5	I would appreciate sending boarding passes sooner so I am able to print them at home before the holiday. Otherwise everything all right and good prices.
5	One of those employees,he may be Erol,help me to have correct reservation at the Iceland <http://travel.Kiwi.com|travel.Kiwi.com> are new to  me but their employee is very enthusiastic and positive whatever concerned to their customers.
5	Friendly courteous and patient.
5	I found some cheap flights via Skypicker, they handled the check-in and gave me information about the baggage sizes and weight. The Costumer service Live Chat is very useful, and they helped me in a matter of minutes
5	Unintentionally entered wrong passport number and date of expiry. Send an email to customer service which was answered shortly. Great and friendly service!
5	Great contact, and great customer support, reply very quick to emails.
5	I booked a flight from Köln/Bonn to Gdansk using Skypicker. When I tried to check in online I accidentally typed in a wrong number so I called the service number to have them change it.The service was great. Uncomplicated, reliable and very kind. I can highly recommend this page!The service guy even called back later to let me know that everything turned out to be fine. Thanks again ;)
4	The chat client is very useful to get things done right away. Natalya helped me briefly.
1	Can't really say anything bad about Tomas in Chat. He informed the booking section and they called my at 02:00AM on Saturday, trying to offer me a different route. What I haven't realized in my sleepiness, that all offers were for the 8th., not for the 9nth like I initially booked.So I stayed in HAM Airport and got informed that, that I haven't checked the dates. My Flight flew 24h ago.Good support in chat and phone, but the date was never mentioned. So my holiday flight got cancelled, but I was able to pay the full price for it.For all customers I can only say to never forget to triple check the dates on your ticket, especially when you need to change the route.Issue for the first flight cancel was the Strike in Greece.
5	thanks for your amazing attention,you are very friendly, wonderful and i enjoy speak with your while you are helping me. I recommend 100% <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com>
5	Fast, accurate, polite operators
5	Booked my flight through this site which was by far the cheapest i found. It has also the best navigation and layout. Had some questions afterwards and tried the live chat where i got a really nice customer service with good and fast respones. So far the best booking site for flights - would recommend!
5	We had a problem with one of our flights that we had booked. Anna T handeled our problem, she was very kind and helpful! thank you very much for the great and tolerant treatment!
5	So far, I have used services provided by <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> several times and every time it was a good experience. The crew is very helpful and very professional. I recommend <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> to everyone who want to keep the management of his/her flights simple and reliable.

5	I needed help with my last-minute e-ticket and boardingpass, and Archie helped me with everything i needed, thanks! :)
5	Great customer care from operator Eva. She did everything I needed and if a bit extra.
5	I was on the online chat with Adam Jelinek who was very quick to respond and helped with a resolution. He understood my worries of needing to reschedule flights for our honeymoon due to family drama. Adam will investigate further as to whether the tickets are refundable and if the airline can do a favour, I like that I have an actual person to talk to and not a robot. Thanks Adam :)
5	I made a mistake on my booking and my father was stucked at the airport. Through the chatroom, Dominika helped me and offered me solutions in a very nice way. She was polite and so professional! Thanks again and I will certainly book again with Kiwi!

3	My experience with a ticket bought in Kiwi:I arrived to the counter of the airline in order to get my boarding pass and the person in charge told me that the payment was not made.I called Kiwi and they answered really fast, the problem was that the person in the line did not speak proper english, I could not understand her very well. I called again and the person who answered spoke perfectly and she solved all the problems.Thanks for your patience and good work!
5	I have great experience with <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> support center, the operator (Rebecca) was extremely helpful and solved all my requests in blink of an eye. Just perfect!!! Thank you.
1	"I went through the most terrible experience with a flight company with skypickerfirst problem was with luggages,i buyed my reservation without luggages at first time, but when i checked the eTickets of each of the 6 flights in the websites of pegasus and vueling, i noticed that 4 out of the 6 flights had luggage with them, and i only needed to pay 30 euro more to get 6/6 luggages while skypicker was showing 120 eurowhen i discussed this whith an agent they gave me another price 81 euro and warned that if i buy the luggages directly from vueling they will no longer be responsible about anything in my reservation (wow?)second problem: 16 days before my first flight sadly my visa was declined, i contacted skypicker asap to ask about a possibility of a refund 2 days later they told me they can only apply for tax refund i accepted.while waiting for the refund i checked my eTickets at vueling and pegasus and effectively only tax refund was possible.i had no refund and no reply wince then until the last day before my flight i sent an email asking for the result or the refund, they told me:""We are unable to cancel it""so so?? pegasus and vueling say they offer you a refund and you say you cannot?i need some explanations? or in fact, i need my money."
1	I reserver today a fly germani to tenerife, i payed for it , but i dont have a confirmation of my booking, they tell me that he need few hours but i dont have notice about it
5	Contacted Igor through the Chat following an issue regarding my flight. He answered very fast, provided his best services and positive attitude. Very nice to see that customer service still means something. Big up Igor
4	Because this was my first reservation ever, I had hard time making reservation. Natali! Thank you for being so kind. I got a big help from you. Sorry for my short English. You were so polite and I'm glad that I'd solve my problem. Have a nice day! Thank you Kiwi for the fast process.
3	Skypicker kindly refer to my PM immediately regarding my boarding pass, i only have few hours left before my flight. The airline company says u already made a web checked in which is contrary to the message sent to me that i have to check in personally at the airport
5	This may just be the perfect app for budget international travel. #guideadvisor #travel #tech  <https://t.co/8HI78alMCO>
5	By far the best company to buy a ticket, easy and trustful communication with the client, immediately appears the information luggage(kg & price), as well as other information that usually companies want to hide. Congrats
1	i booked 3 tickets at same time and just one of them was confirmed. This is truly said! When I asked to get the refund back from the 3rd ticket they told that it is not possible. Never buy via this system!
5	Don't fly with @skypickercom. You pay to check your bags in for each flight and have to go through security! #BerlinToPortland #150more
5	Francesco has been extremely helpful! he acted immediately and fulfilled my request. great customer service and attention to my needs. highly recommended

4	The experience i had was excellent. I had spoken to their customer service who's name is Tomas. He was really helpsome and friendly. He managed to give me the information i needed for my coming trip. It is not costly buying plane tickets and extra luggage from this company. I would certainly recommend their services. I am truly satisfied.
5	Customer support, namely miss Mariya Potello, was very helpful as I tried to add additional luggage to my flight less than 48 hours before the departure. I called them late at night and she really helped me a lot even though I didn't have much time left to solve the problem. At the end it all turned great for me and the additional luggage costed only 32 eur for both directions! People at Kiwi were very responsive and nice, I will book flights through them again. :) Thanks again!
4	Had a little trouble to check in, but David from support helped me a lot!!
5	I would like to thank the team of Mohammed, Jana and Adrian for making sure that i get quick responses to my inquiries regarding my booking. Made me feel a lot better that everything was being handled well.

But then through my experience during the travel I recognize that they do their Job very well. Skypicker team helped me with all questions and with rebooking, when I had troubles due to delaying of flights.
5	Great and fast service from Petra M.! Thank u a lot!I added baggage to my flight 2 days back and was worried why it has not completed yet. Petra helped me via chat and sent me confirmation less than 2 hours!

4	I had a question about receiving my boarding passes.Spoke with Artem Krohin and he was very helpful
5	I received an excellent service on <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>'s chat, when having difficulties with the online check in. The agent quickly sorted everything out. Thank you!
5	"This is my ""go to"" app for booking flights. I'm travelling all the time and kiwi has been a dream to use. Super easy to use and I've never had a problem after a booking. I highly recommend it."
5	After receiving reminders to provide information for online check-in, I realized I was too late and the option to enter info was no longer available. I reached out via live chat and was assisted by Filip. He was very helpful and took care of my online check-in process on his side. I really appreciated it! He was very friendly and the issue was taken care of really quickly.
5	David provided efficient and attentive customer service via live chat helping me to resolve a mistake I made booking. I would definitely use Kiwi again!
5	I found Skypicker very straight forward to use when booking flights.  I had entered my passport expiration date incorrectly and was fixed easily and quickly by Daria using the online chat. Very pleased
5	Used the 24/7 online chat. Maria was very helpful and patient. Got it all sorted right away!
5	it's really nice to talk to the friendly staff and especially to the listening
4	There was a small issue with the checked bagagge because the data was not correct when booking the flight. Fortunately, Jana and Simon where very helpful and provided me the information to do it at the airport. Thank you guys!
5	It's a safe company to chose if you shall buy tickets
5	Mr. Eric was very helpful, thank you again for making my boarding cards so quickly as i was on the phone with you and walking to airplan.
5	I'd take it :)
5	I had made a spelling mistake to the surname of one of my friends when booking and asked <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> for advise on how to correct this mistake. Within 24 hours I had a return email with instructions on what to do and within 48 hours I had a new e-Ticket sent to me with the correct name on it. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> to anyone.
4	My assisant Adrian was very helpful and patient and helped me to understand all the doubts about my flight. Good service for now!
1	"Greetings to all,first of all I ask you NOT to book with <http://KIWI.com|KIWI.com>. Read my story and decide by your own if they deserve it. This is what happened:My father had an accident and is in the hospital in germany, probably dying. Therefore I was looking(29.10) for a quick but still cheap flight between the 31. Oct - 7. Nov. At momondo I have found some cheap flights offered by KIWI, these flights already get more expensive but thats pretty normal because flight websites are not refreshed all the time. Then I was looking at Kiwi for a flight between the dates and first I checked Monday(IMPORTANT:31. oct), where I have found a good one (755$ Melbourne - Berlin). I opened the flight in a new tab but of course first I am checking if there is a cheaper one at another day/ other websites. After some research I decided that one was actually the best and get back to my tab and fill everything in. Booked, all good. In the night I´m getting the mail for my flight details, a flight for the 14th NOV ??Next morning the service tells me they will try to refund but probably one of the airlines wont pay. I could check, may I want just to change the date instead. EVERY other date costs me MORE than the flight itself, they call it ""CHANGE"" but actually it means almost ""BUY NEW ONE - From our website of course"". Sidenote: They are telling you: ""In order to bring you the best possible service , we offer our customers an exclusive and unique flight change, delay and cancellation policy, called the <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> Guarantee (or Assistant Services)."" (Of course the second part of this tells you not every situation is refundable) -> At the second call they try to explain me this is NOT possible because the airlines which they booked are low budget ones, I checked their flights again to see they have HUGE range of these airlines in sale which means the WHOLE REFUND STATEMENT IS A JOKE when half of the offers CANNOT get refunded. When they would be honest then they have to say we CANT refund your flight but give it a try and call us. Anyway I never booked for the 14th November so I am getting angry and explain what happened, additionally I CANT take the flight in 2 weeks because maybe I ll miss to see my father alive. I told them its important for me to fly this week and the support told me they understand and will check what happened when I were searching for Monday the 31. Oct. and getting to a flight to book that is on 14th November. He also told me they´ll give me a call in a hour to discuss further options for example to change the flight to this week cause they really cant refund the other one. I DIDNT get a call,I recognize they couldnt figure out what happened and try to avoid finding any solution that gives them any disadvantage. Instead I get an e-mail the next day to change the flight, 800$ !!!  Now the service leaves me to call them again, a new worker and I´ll have to explain this whole thing again.Now it gets really intense, I double check if there is really not a single flight to change without paying minimum less 50% of the price I have already paid. I am looking for Melbourne to Berlin, a single date. Then I change the date between 31. -14th Nov, check out what happened:LINK to picture: https:// - <http://postimg.org|postimg.org> - /image/x1wxrztyr/b0b9120b/- delete the space(shown with -) cause links arent allowed but its important.Mel is LOCKED IN but even while ""changing"" the flight which is MEL to Ber it RANDOMLY jumps to a starting city with the shortcut IKA. - I realized cause the flight is too short to be possible. What would happen if I book that one, will they tell me it is my BAD that I have choose a ""CHANGING"" flight from MEL to BER but now I´ll need to get to IKA somehow??? Now imagine this is happening with the date, you lock in 31 Oct. and the website actually shows the flights from 14th Nov. (the date is shown in the smallest way, it can happen easy that you dont recognize). THIS WEBSITE IS NOT WORKING PROPERLY, that is something I didnt expect so I apologize I should have double checked the details of the flight. Anayway, when YOUR website leads me to the wrong flight and its not even a unknown bug( I had it TWICE now - one time with screenshot) then I really expect a solution where I am NOT the one who has to pay for it. When a seller in the supermarket showing me the wrong item by mistake(BUG on website in this case) they have to correct that mistake, too bad its hart to sue this kind of companies. They dont take responsibility for their cheap made website so now I am the one whos getting forced to pay, I can choose between a price that is MORE then my already booked one to ""change"" - nice solution you get double money from me while youre the one who created this situation with a not good coded website) - or I have to pay with the last moments that I wont have with my father. I am SUPER upset, angry and frustrated, I dont even have the money to change the flight and in addition I dont want to spend ANY money EVER again for KIWI. Even more, I ask EVERYBODY in regard to my father NOT to book <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> any more, they do NOT deserve it. Excuse me for using caps and my bad english but this needs to get public. This wont be the only website you´ll find this review and feel free to tell other people what happened.Cheers, Adrian."
5	Oga helped me with managing my flight and was super friendly.Thanks for such a great service
5	I needed help with my flight booking and agent mohammed Abdelkader. Helped me  step by step through my booking. (Very good agent).10/10. Very polite, helpfull. Has very good customer skills. Very good at resolving queries.  Very satisfied.
4	I pressed the confirmation button to soon, as I realized after 5 minutes I picked the wrong time of departure. I called client service and Dorotha was extremely helpful and clear on my options. She contacted the airline and responded within the hour she promised. I managed to get my flight changed. I never heard about Kiwi before and had my doubts, but having such great service, removed my doubts and will consider them for sure in future bookings.KR- Nonna (Alwia)
1	@skypickercom waiting for your confirmation forever :(
5	Very responsive; helped me to arrange the wheel chair assistance for my Mom.
4	I just needed to do my Ceck in and I can say the costumer service is so easy and quick,I would like to thanks RODON for helping me out so quick and easy and ... keep up the good work!!!

5	Very fast reponse via chat! Great deals, good service. I'm highly satisfied by the way I was treated :)
2	After having a good experience with kiwi, I talked highly of them and decided to book with them again.This ended up a total disaster. They did not inform me in time that my payment had not been processed, and my expenses have nearly doubled due to their inadequacy. The money was in the account, and due to the cardholder (my fiance) being different then my name, security had problems with this. This is not the first time him & I have booked this way (as not having a bank account in the UK it was easier for the deposit to be made in his account so we could pay this way)and I called repeatedly to try and resolve this issueI asked to speak to a supervisor many times and no one connected meOne girl I spoke to cut me off multiple times when I tried to speak to herI felt highly disrespectedNot only this, it took so much time for them to inform me that the payment hasn't processed and due to rising ticket prices I am spending 500+ more than I initially planned to, not to mention an inconvenience to various people involved and close to me..I was offered no type of compensation for this mess, and I am highly upset and disappointed. Not only has this changed my opinion of kiwi, but of CR !!!!
4	When i had problem, pedro helped me. I solved that problem. Pedro was very kind. I really appreciate his help. Thank you very much
1	Tried to make a booking a few weeks ago, made the payment with Trustly and the site stopped working. Didn't receive a booking reference nor my tickets. I'm trying for more than 3 weeks to get my money back. Spoke with about 15 support employees, but it hasn't been sorted out yet. I even got promised that I would be refunded in 10 days. Still haven't received yet in 14 days. I got multiple promises that everything would be sorted out, I am still waiting for it however, I will never book by this company. They're a scam!
5	I was helped by Maria on live chat and she was fantastic. Very efficient and friendly, would encourage me use <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> again
5	Don't know where to start start, iv saved almost 325$ so far it's an itemized thing so you gotta be careful but they let YOU decide you comfort zone and the level you wanna pay for , I was skeptical at first not being over in here in the states but they are legit and very very nice people to work with, agencies like these are the future and are what are going to save us money , I give their customer service  a 10 only cuz the communication was in believable I was a happy person in the 4 am but I asked them to call anyway if it regarded my  vacation, I didn't care we had a issue with the carrier and they handled everything for me and saved me additional money over the initial carrier , u I fly in 12 hours already have my boarding passes and itinerary thanks to the lovely and very patient ALEXANDRA  Y. ; senior travel consultant( you were amazing with me and am grateful you made me feel very comfortable with my money spending and helped meThrough some better ideas , a woman that takes pride in her job !!!! RARE!! Good people at skypicker ,Ever rep I dealt with was cool including
5	My experience with Skypicker was very satisfying, easy site to find low-cost flights, understandable booking process, boarding passes sent, all in all, everything went perfect. Thank you!
5	Just got helped by Martin Carter, great guy and excellent service!! Good job!
5	I have got very fast and really professional response from Issis on chat support. That was very helpfull. Thanks a lot.

4	Your help was great to book the ticket and roman your help was great on call... thank you so much :)
5	It is the first time I use SkyPicker and I gladly say that the service has been splendid. Thank you very much Tomas for being a kind and helpfull humanbeing :grinning:
4	QUICK AND HELPFUL RESPONSES WITH QUERIES.
1	This company made a charge to my bank account, without  my permission.   I have never used or bought any services from this company.  Now I am having to get a new bank card.  A BUNCH OF THIEVES.
5	Excellent service even when using customer service for seat/luggage bookings and checking in.
5	I had the best chat with Babak, so helpfull and nice! I can really recomend this. Thanks alot Babak!
4	Usually I don't need any service support, but you never know. So I must be lucky that Skypicker's support team is so good. I'm specially amazed by the efficiency of my facebook contact, nice done. The downside so far, before the travel is over, is  my chat contacts on the website. Low speed and not so competent. Lets see my review in the end of June.
5	Thanks for your good and fast service. The Chat is a good way to communicate !
5	Awesome website!, excellent deals, easy booking and clear info.
3	FYI to anyone interested: round trip Vancouver > Paris for $300 <https://t.co/gnS4dw0zgD>
1	"Today I booked the airplane to Hongkong from South Korea. however I thought that I had a mistake with this reservation so I want to cancel with it. But they say just ""we will contact in 30 days."" It is a macro answer. I mean robot answer. So I feel very nervous now. You don't have to use this site never."
5	It is very simple to use the site. Both an advantage and a disadvantage of skypicker being an intermediary is that they simplified the process, but for some changes to the booking you don't have direct access. However for me the live chat worked great, both before completing my booking for questions, and after: I needed to upgrade to a large cabin luggage and they did it for me. Also keep in mind that you might need to personally transfer your checked luggage for transfer flights. You might also need to do the check-in as early as two days before your flight and their non-refundable policy is very clear.Bottom line: It works perfectly if you know from the beginning what you want, but their personnel is well trained to assist with changes and anticipate what you need to know, so don't hesitate to ask.
5	I had some special wishes for my 5 y/o son. I called many times to helpdesk and negotiated with 5 operators. Now I remember only three of them: Martin Lauer, Erika Bělašková and especially Lenka Havlíčková - she finally solved all our demands, but all of them were cooperative and helpful. And even although they could think we fabricate our demands.Great experience and looking forward next time (I promise we will not have so many demands and calls :-)Jan Šmíd
5	I chatted with Tamara because I was confused about the check-in process.  They asked for my passport ID but I'm travelling locally within the US and don't have my passport with me.  She requested my drivers license instead.  She was very helpful and answered all my questions.
4	Elena Sh. was very kind to offer me all the details I asked for plus addittional information I might need. Her replies were effective and she had a very positive and nice attitude. Thank you.
5	I would like to thanks to Alan for their help. He solved very quickly all my issues and also gave me information which I don't know and which was important for me.Thank youMilos Zidik

5	I have recently booked a very special vacation for my family and I to go to Cancun, Mexico for my birthday. The booking went smoothly because I was helped by a very nice lady named Abigail. She was very proper and professional. Booking flight can be a pain... But not this time. Thanks Abigail!
5	Had a stressful day because I had 2 flights cancelled, but was able to get everything sorted out with the help of Lukas, Katie, and Milica. Thank you!
5	Great trustworthy site, polite support, cheap tickets!
5	Thank u Simon for your help! <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> hope to book more flightS here!
5	Done a booking with them for a flight from Cancun to Cuba, no problem. It was quick and easy.
5	I did not trust <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> with my passport details, so i did not use their early check-in service. Not wise of me! Costed me 50€ To check-in with my 1st flight! Lesson learned i contacted kiwi's live chat, and they instantly checked me in an email'ed me my remaining boardingpasses! Thank you Kristina B, for saving me an unnessecary expence of an extra 100€!

5	Kira helped me from Skypicker. She was polite, helpful, and to the point. I am very pleased with my experience with them thus far. I'll be recommending skypicker to my friends!
5	I had a msessed-up reservation and I was losing hope, but then one of your call operators - Lucie Habanová reacted in the best way possible, just like it should be everywere :) She helped me review alternatives while being extremely calm despite me being a little impatient and clumsy with my reservation details. An absolute professional. This was my first encounter with Skypicker, but thanks to her, not my last one :) Another nice employee was Aneta, I think, but I don't remember her name exactly.Best regardsA.K.
5	I'm very satisfied with the help I got from Milica! Thank you
5	Tomas took care of all of my issues in an uncomplicated way. Generally the <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> support team does a fantastic job! They're all polite and extraordinarily motivated solving all the needs you might have.
5	Very impressed with the Live Chat service call with Stan.He answered my questions completely and researched an issue while I was on line.  He also acknowledged an apparent mistake in my original e-ticket and promptly emailed me an updated version.Thanks Kiwi and Stan!!
5	Pavel assisted me on the live chat and was very helpful and pleasant.
5	I have been using Kiwi for too many flights. I just finished my service in Peace Corps and booked a whole bunch of flights so I could explore the world a bit more before I get back home to the good U.S of A. I have called Kiwi, emailed Kiwi, messaged Kiwi, and they have been there every step of the way. Whether it be my fear of flying into Istanbul after a coup, or my negligence in checking my email and booking flights. They have always been patient with me, and have strived for nothing than excellence.In this most recent incident  a one Jan Lukasek, whom helped me patiently check into a Ryanair flight far after Ryanair allows one to. As she was doing so, I noticed that Kiwi sent me multiple email reminders and in the midst of traveling, I never paid attention to them. I didn't receive any attitude, or judgement for not knowing what's in my email. But yet, Jan was fixed the problem with no hassle at all.<http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> is the way to go. And in my future travels. I will use them.
4	A huge thanks to Pedro and to Tomas, they both help me a lot with passport's details and check-in troubles!
5	"My agent "" Simon ""was patient,cordial,Knowledgeable.professional and courteous!"
4	We had problems with the online check-in as there were no place to register our passports, but the customer service checked in for us when we contacted them by phone.
5	The operator Radim was super helpfull. After a flight cancellation, he found us some other flights quickly and an incredible professional efficiency. Many thanks to Radim and <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>.Elia & Séverine.
1	"I started from Kayak and they sent me to <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com>. I bought 2 tickets for a multi-city trip, and when the confirmation came it was only for the first leg of the trip. I tried talking to them via ""live chat"" and they pretended not to understand me. I asked for a refund and they refused. I think this is a bait-and-switch scam."
4	Had to deal with customer service :- First time because my birth date was incorrect in the e-ticket (whereas usually it never happens to me, but it might be my fault) : a quick call to the CS and everything was nicely solved.- Second time because my first flight was cancelled, I figured a way at the airport to change my flight but I had to book a taxi to transfer from the new arrival airport to the initial one. I later learnt that the CS tried to call me to warn me about my flight cancellation and to find me a new flight, but as I solved the situation myself they just reimbursed my taxi fare.In a word: great experience with the customer service.
5	Thank you for solving my problem with Axa. I really appreciate your intervention in this case. I will definitely buy from you again and recommend your services.All the best, Maira
5	I booked a trip with multiple stops through Kiwi and was very satisfied with the price and with the quality of the information they sent me (e.g. they told me that in an airport I had to consider that the check-in online was unavailable, therefore I should plan to get there earlier...).Keep up the good job!
3	With skypicker you have to check in 48hours before the flight, which i couldnt do, but Sena, at their live chat assistance service helped me to do that. Thanks for that, but still this 48 hours rule is not good!
5	Second time booking with Kiwi.Great prices, great online booking system, excellent customer service follow up.Youssef S in particular was very helpful when modifying my booking. He helped me tremendously by calling me back, saving me a lot on data roaming charges, and by dilligently processing my request and keeping me updated on his progress.Couldnt ask for more - would highly recommend Kiwi and Youssef's services.
5	Bek was very helpful finding us seats on our Ryanair flights!
5	Thank you Agent Martin.Agent martin was very helpful with my booking as i got an email for some missing informations on my booking.
4	but i am sure you are cheating passengers. actually i have paid all amount on DEC 19 -2015 . an amount of GBP 159 has been deducted on the time of reservation . anyway i got another message from bank on 05/01/2016 after many days of travel regarding the GBP 159 has been deducted again from my card. i can prove with any documents . already i sent email to you with my ID copy, passport copy , previews ticket copy , card number details ,card holder names and everthing .but i didint get any proper response from your side . now i am requesting to every passenger please dont enter your CREDIT card details in this websit (skypicker) . you will lost money anytime . also you will get a joke reply : you didint make any reservation on that day . actually they are cheating . they will save our card details in their web .kindly beware .. i am requesting to all passenger kindly cancell your ticket with skypicker and ask them for refund . also call to your bank and take a request to block your Credit card . otherwise they will use anytime . you will lost your money without any authenticationAyyoob KP Fujairah my registered email with skypicker : ayyoobkpfujairah@gmailcontact number : 00971553268077

5	Very very helpful ! Needed to cancel and he did it instantly with no charge
5	I tried to search flight from Charlottetown to Amsterdam and couldn't find anywhere except from Monondo which linked me to Kiwi. Website is very easy to use, plus they have direct line from Thailand so I can call them to check everything easity. I had help from call center twice, they even called me when the flight time was changed. I got email from support team very quick too, especially Martin Carter Smehlik replied my email that he will be the one who take care of me about my flight, which I really appreciated.After my flight I will be more than happy to write good things about Kiwi again.Prin
5	Adam Jelinek helped us change some information about our flight, and made us aware of other errors in the booking! Also, he was very friendly and answered all our questions.Great service, totally recommended!
4	Thanks to Romana i had my ID number added to my reservation and the ticket sent to my email address within minutes, it was a pleasure, especially considering that it was the first time i use skypicker!

That's why i tried live chat. it was absolutely good choice.Thank you so much! I was warried about this but now i am just waiting my flight!  I surely use this company again!
5	Got excellent options and prices from SkyPicker . Great value and excellent follow up from SkyPicker and <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>.  I needed an invoice for my flights and bags alone - when the booking was done in a group. No problem this was done for me.  Would recommend with a big thumbs up
5	Nice support, and very helpful personality many thanks Bachana K
5	Great customer service from Honza, very helpful, nice and he managed my inquiry very fast :)
5	Very trustfull company.They were really suportive in all my doubts, and I had alot since it was my first travel in flying companys.Thanks so much kiwi team(Specially to Patrik)
5	Fast assistance!
4	Ticket worked fine. Price was fine. Be ready for a lot of lame emails asking you if the flight was ok or if you are ready for the flight etc. Then also the lame targeted ads, which offer the same flight you just took at a lower cost (supposedly). Just annoying. But I got from A to B.
5	Good servis and really helpful personnel!
4	I contacted jiri with the online service regarding an issue not recieving my boarding pass and i recieved fast and useful solutions. 5 stars for this person!
5	I had an issue with my Online check-in and was offered exemplary customer service by Serihy who was very courteous and helped me through the process in no time whatsoever.
1	@skypickercom is literally one of my worst mistakes. Its given me nth but headaches. (1/3)
5	Best site for travellers! Excellent online support!
4	It was fast service and also friendly!Especially thanks to Radim K. for helping me the whole time.
5	We had a great help from our online agent, Yulia! She helped us with the passport information, selecting our seats and answering all our questions! The connection was very fast and there was no waiting time to have our questions answered.This was some of the best customer service!!! Thank you, Yulia and Skypicker!
5	Good & reliable service. No complains.
5	I had some troubles with managing my booking, but Alan Whitfield really helped me) he was really polite and professional. I even decided to ask his name and to make sure that he would be noticed by his boss or whoever else. Just he gave me service, that I expected to get. So thanks Kiwi and his workers for a good job)
4	Patience and helpful support (Venda) is highly appreciated
5	Eric provided a wonderful service, website is intuitive and he guided me through the process
5	Igor Guzvinec helped me a lot during my time here in Nyaungshwe in Myanmar. The airline companies of Myanmar are, in a word, slow, and Igor made sure that my ticket was processed before my flight, even offering to work overtime despite a very busy schedule that day for him. Very satisfied!
1	The day I first booked my tickets I replied back to the online check in request for myself and my brother. Arriving here and now and the airport I had to outlay 45Euro because my brothers check in was fine but mine wasn't. I had replied back many times and now I have had to outlay unessecary money because of this. I had filled in both our passport information right away and now I am left with less money in my pocket. I would like to be reimbursed!!!! Poor communication and lack of website use.
4	This was my first purchase from Kiwi. So I was insecure their reputation and abilities. So I had a lot of questions... but Pedro countinued answering me and  kindly explained until I could understand. Thanks to Pedro, I think I can have hopeness to have a good trip.Thank you Pedro!
2	Is it sky pickers or skyfuckers? definitely fuckers, useless fuckers at that, fuck you around fuckers too. My advice--Fuck em
5	I've got exsekent help manage my flights with Bek! Everything was done quickly and very nice communication. Thank you! :)
5	The people attending are very knowledgeable and professional to clear up any doubt
5	I messed up my journey because i didn't check properly my email and discovered hours before my flight that it got cancelled, Petra Musilova did the IMPOSSIBLE and found me, in no time, another flight for the same day, she really did the IMPOSSIBLE!
5	I would like to say a huge thank you to Angelika from the polish KIWI TEAM, who very patiently and kindly answered all my questions and provided me with all the information I needed. It was a pleasure to speak with her. Great job!
5	Very friendly and diligent in providing me information.
5	i've forgot to enter my passport details and couldnt download my boarding pass but thru oline chat Olena sent me the boarding pass via email. it took me 5 min.
1	I'd advise extreme caution before using this company, they will rip you off if the circumstances present themselves for them to do so.However the good news is, the possibility for a chance meeting for someone who has been ripped off by this company with the CEO of the company is multiplying uncontrollably.Good luck.

5	Kiwi definitely had the lowest prices (by far) for my upcoming international flight.  However, during booking I wasn't able to enter my TSA Precheck Known Travelor Number (KTN). I contacted Kiwi about it and they said they could not add it for me. I assured them there was a way to do it and soon after I was contacted by Juan Costa. Juan was able to add my KTN to my eligible boarding passes which became a life saver. I appreciate all his help and am grateful he could assist me. I would also like to add other customer service representives were very helpful as well. I had a ton of questions since this was my first Kiwi experience. I love their 24 hour service. I will say the only thing I disliked about Kiwi is that at each layover I will have to recheck my baggage every time due to it being different airlines, this is an annoyance because I have four transfers. I'm not sure if Kiwi could do something to change this in the future or not but it would help improve the hassle. Other than that great work everyone and again, thanks Juan!
4	A few days before our flights i noticed we hadnt been sent our ryanair boarding passes. Our documentation from skypicker said to just check in at the airport .... which is fine for premium airlines like airnz, etihad, emirates etc  but ryanair slap you with a ridiculous check in fee. Using skypickers live chat awesome support from barbara zemanova had it sorted in a few hours and no issues on next flights. Thanks barbara z :blush::blush:
5	I mistakenly booked my flight with wrong destination, but it was resolved in less than an hour!
4	Fully satisfied, if they only add the relevant terminal numbers on their tickets.
5	I needed assistance with my flight, so I opened live chat and the agent, Lenka, quickly and very politely provided me with all the information that I needed. Thank you again Lenka. Nice talking to you. :)
5	I had problems with boarding cards and websites Serhii Kiian was awesome.. he fixed stuff quickly and rang back when he promised An excellent representative of Kiwi .Thank you
4	The most exciting travel app we’ve seen this year finds discount flights that are ‘hidden' on airline web sites <https://t.co/LpaCXduPPA>
5	I'm currently on a trip in SE Asia, and only discovered <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> a few weeks ago (when it was still skypicker).I've since used it for multiple flights, I even had to book a last minute flight in about 10 minutes at a malaysian airport to satisfy immigration officials that I would exit the philippines and it worked a charm.The best part about the site is their innovative user interface where you can compare flight prices/routes on a map at the same time. Rather than viewing it all as a list like on skyscanner/kayak etc.I also entered my passport number incorrectly on my phone, and was able to contact cust services and sort it within five minutes (Thank you Valery!)My only reservation is that the site works slowly on my Microsoft Windows phone. I would love to see a smooth running <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> app designed for windows phones.
5	Mario R. made the experience of changing my flights and exploring all options painless and dare I say fun?! He was so polite and friendly. I felt that he actually cared if it all worked out OK. You will be lucky to get him :)
5	I Had to cancel my flight and the help was very good The Lady was so Friendly and helpfulwould most definitely recommend her for everyone what a great experience thank you @Jana Turcanova you are a GREAT person so calm and helpfull !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Thank-you Kiwi
5	I booked a last minute ticket from abudhabi to Cochin. Very cheap even though booked the ticket 12 hours before the trip
4	@yTravelBlog Skypicker has an interactive map that lets travelers see how much flights cost anywhere! <https://t.co/YuJNgCjAOH>
5	Tanks for All team of Skypicker for the excellent and very quick help :heart:
5	Skypicker was both very easy and very efficient to use, taking hardly any time at all. I received helpful follow up information and reminders when needed. The airline check-in staff knew who I was, that I had used Skypicker and checked me in quickly so Skypicker was obviously notifying that side effectively as well.
1	I've used once, and never again. Chat is useless!! They truly suck!!
5	The best costumer service I was pleased to talk everytime andare they avere nice and avaylable they solved my issues and avere useful
5	A big big big thank to travel consultant Radek Pospisil! I accidentally booked a flight ticket twice, and he helped me to quickly solve it with full refund ! Thanks again to Kiwi.
4	This is/was a great service for the best price I could find.  It does take some getting use to if you've never used such a service as you are not dealing directly with the airline.  However, the savings of over $300.00 on my ticket made it very beneficial and will/would use the service again.
1	I was sick in Australia and could not make my flights to Bangkok and I contacted Skypicker and they advised me that all fees are non-refundable.I paid extra 80,00 for one checked bag and they kept that also.  That is high way robbery.  With any other travel company the checked baggage is always refundable.  I would never use this company again.  They are there to make money and that is all.  It is too sad.
5	Thank you Luci for the amazing service and wish you and <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> great luck in the future. Definetly will recommend you guys!Best Regards,Ignacio Buchvarov
5	Thank you Youssef, the chat service is excellent. I was in doubt if I had done the updates correctly, but it was confirmed in a few minutes.
5	Your online help was fantastic.I want to personally thank Helen for her help.Much appreciated
5	I lost my conjoin flight to Vancouver in London because of the bad weather. They gave me another day ticket for free but not in the same day because it was too expensive EUR 998. Althogh i could not fly in the same day they pay me 50eur for the hotel and 10e for the lunch.The staff who helped me is called Issis and she was really kind trying to hep me a lot and worried about my situation, and finally she gave a quick solution to my problem, for that i am very grateful.
1	Useless customer service. Changing a flight is very inconvenient.
5	<http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> has a very frequent live chat to help you out with your problems or answer your questions! Special thanks to Henry, I managed to do my check-in online alright, when I thought it was too late! Another special thanks to Anna who tried to help me with other issues the other day! I strongly recommend to have a live chat if you have any problem.
5	I didn't get a confirmation mail because I apparently entered the wrong e-mail address. Miroslav corrected it for me via the chat and it was fixed within two minutes. Very friendly and helpful customer service!
5	I received fantastic assistance from Jana Zdechovanová on all things related to my flights and check-in. She was excellent and very speedy!
5	Some awesome NY sales flight glitches. Some people have managed to get incredbly cheap / free flights. Works... <https://t.co/9lIB3MpQBl>
1	I booked a flight from Australia via Sky Scanner which redirected me to Kiwi - the date of the flight was changed when redirected. I noticed within a minute of booking and informed them 1 minute later. At this point the booking status was 'received'. The agent was reluctant to help and said she would get back to me within 12 hours. It was 1 and a half hour later that the status was updated to 'confirmed' and I do believe that amendments could have been made in this period. The flight is now useless as my visa will have already expired and they want full payment for another flight. Extremely upset with the service.
5	Needed advice in respect of two flight bookings.  On line chat with Radek who could not have been more helpful.  Looking forward to my holiday now.  Thank you Radek!
5	I asked about adding checked baggage. and Miroslav and Sara helped me very nicely.
5	I could write a lengthy review, but less is more.  I would like to say thank you, thank you to Fahd, Nikola, Martina, Eva, Petr, Lucy and Marketa.  This should give you an idea of how many times that I called..lol.  I asked for their names because each and every one of these fine individuals treated me with respect and with unparalleled professionalism through my ordeal of potentially cancelling, postponing, cancelling then ultimately staying on schedule.  I'm in the airport now preparing to board my flight.  I highly recommend Kiwi.  Their business model and staff should be cloned.  Yes, go with Kiwi.. they're good at what they do!!  Thanks again!!
3	@askairasia Hi.I bought tickets on Skypicker. Now I´d like link my booking on AirAsiaSite, but I cant. How could I procedure? And check bags
3	@mskathmw Dear Katherine,you can find our contacts here <https://t.co/PD6QF6zqaf>. Please,give us your phone number and we will call you back.
5	I had a tricky situation with my e-ticket, I enter the wrong nationality by mistake. But ISABELLE was really kind and helpful and she solve the problem .
2	On the returning trip, at the check in my husband and I were told we had two separate bookings therefore we couldn't combine our luggage. We were also told we were entitled 20kg each and not just the 15kg we paid for. We had to buy an extra bag at the airport to solve the problem. If we had one booking it would have been fine. Then in Kuala Lumpur we were told we were entitled 30kg each!!! Was really disappointing that from 4 flights only one had separate bookings and the kg allowed weren't correct on the email sent by skypicker. Regards, Marcia
4	I was assisted by Vally on the online chat regarding problems with the payment for additional services. After letting him know I couldn't see or hadn't recieved any payment link for my booking he then fixed the problen in few minutes! Great support :)!
5	I cant recommend this website enough! Customer support is one of the best I have ever experienced and flights offerings are the cheapest by far! Love <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>
5	Very responsive to messages. I am pleased somebody was there to help.
5	Excellent costumer service, I had the opportunity to speak with this feller called Martin Carter and he was really helpful, I definitely recommend anyone to use Skypicker
1	Hi,I was looking at the feasibility of cancelling my flight due to family issues. Its so difficult to understand the support folks who called me from +4202888510 (dont think its a good phone number of theirs, looks like they are hiding their actual number). Also, so rude, the person kept the phone down because I was asking him a question as to why the refund was so low. So poor, whichever country they are operating from. I think they need to work on their english first. They charged me an exhorbitant fee of about 85% of the ticket for cancellation.If somebody takes way 85% of the charge, wont you ask him/her a question why? I too did so. And what did I get. A hung phone line........Somebody please give some customer service sense to skypicker or kiwi.
4	Just booked my first flight with @skypickercom heading to Stockholm for @travelmassive
1	Hi There,  I would like to inform you that my trip did not smooth when i booked with you! My Air Asia flight on 24th Dec 2015 from KL to Kolkata was cancelled without any notice by SMS or Email!!It also happened again with my IndiGo flight on 2nd Jan 2016 from Varansi to Kalkata. The flight has changed the timing without any notice!! And this is your fault as my friend he booked the ticket directly from IndiGo and he got the email. What happened with your suck management?!! You need to take responsibility as i also missed my flight from Kolkata to Bangkok on 3rd Jan 2016 too!! If you do not do anything i will spread all these suck to all media online as much as i can. That is the only thing i can do.I will call you to Thailand office tomorrow to follow up!This will be my first and last time to book my flight with Skysucker! Unless you do something that can you your client's mind.Thanks,Asi
4	Was looking for the cheapest site as always.  Skypicker was not it.  It's in not was the most expensive either, but the chepaest options looked dodgy.  Skypicker was had the lowest price with decent reviews.  So I went for it.Everything went smooth so I am happy.
5	This is my first time travelling with skypicker. I am very happy with their service, very helpful and friendly,  and they answered any queries very speedily
5	I had a problem with my name in the eletronic ticket, then I entered in the chat and Hana and Jana helped me really kindly and solved my problem with no fees. Thank you, girls!
5	Thanks Leonardo Paredes for your wonderful help with my booking this afternoon.
5	A good experience. Skypicker had the lowest prices and were easy to order. The tickets were directly sent to mail, so it went very smooth at the airport since we then were already checked in.
5	Eric was happy to be of assistance, didn't rush anything, making sure to double check when when necessary, was helpful and supplied great advice..

5	Krystina Mlcuchova was a great help to us when we in a fix. My grandfather had booked an indirect flight to Malaga instead of a direct flight and Krystina managed to sort this out for us. Thank you skypicker
5	I had troubles with additionally booked luggage, again Emre Tam helped superfast!Thank you!
5	Buen sericio .... .... .... .. . . .  ...... ... . . .  .. . . . .  .. . For mila u.
5	The experience of booking a trip through skypicker was really good. I was especially impressed with the costumer support when I had entered the wrong details for flight check in and needed help correcting it. Overall good and quick service.
5	She was very patient while i kept looking for the id cards and helped me a lot with getting my boarding passes issued so i'd say, excellent service!
5	I have talked with Alikan and he was very polite and helpfulThank you very much!
5	Exelent work of Patrik! Thank u! I`m happy that everything is that well.
4	The site was easy to use and navigate, but upon selecting a flight I wasn't allowed to choose my seat. I contacted the Live Chat option and Bek helped me sort this out. Virtually painless.
5	everything was fine
2	A startup that finds discount flight tickets 'hidden' on airline websites just launched in the US<https://t.co/3lxriKDu3s>
1	"Terrible experience. Incorrect information given on their App. Wrong terminal details provided in the e-ticket. They disconnected a flight that was already connected by the airline in order to give ""cheaper tickets"". What a nonsensical way of adding value to customers?! When all is done and dusted they will abstain from taking any responsibility for their actions. Pathetic! Stay away!"
5	I really like this company (<http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>) because I was able to book my tickets for a good price and with much ease. I encountered a problem where I could not entire my travel documents online via the website, so I called the customer service and was helped by a gentleman called SIMON, who was very courteous, helpful, patient, and was able to quickly & professionally resolve my issue. I will definitely do business with <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> again.
5	I needed some more informations about my flight. In the middle of the night I decided to text through online chat. Immy I got very nice and helpful response. Thank you again for your help, Yulia Y.
5	Had a problem with online check-in but Patrik from livechat resolved our problem really fast! Thanks!!
5	I have also booked several times with Skypicker before and had no problems. However, last week, I arrived to the airport at 1am for my flight at 3am, only to find out that the flight was ready for departure. It was partially my fault for not double checking, but the airline had changed their flight time - making it two hours earlier! I never received an email, but the airline claimed that emailed Skypicker. They told me I wouldn't get on another flight for at least 48 hours, but that would mean I would miss another flight!  Long story short, Skypicker was able to get me on the next available flight even though the airline sternly told me it was full! I was in contact with many representatives: Anastasia, Kira (not sure about the spelling), Kostya, and Mohamed. Thanks to them and everyone else at Skypicker who work hard for their customers!
5	Martin Carter,  I want to thank you again  for your help)I was really impressed .
5	Thank you very much to the team, especially to Clarisse and Daniela.They are efficient and fast to answer me and to give me all informationIn some days I have my trip and I have everything ready.Many thanksMaria Stella Trimboli
5	I worked with Kate on the Live Chat - we needed to make changes to our booking and she was ever so helpful! The problem was resolved in a matter of minutes and Kate made the whole thing very painless. Thank you for all your help - we will certainly be using SkyPicker again.
4	god cheap ticketsI had some trouble with entering my passport number into the site.But i got great online help on their chat function by Eva. :)
5	I got a fantastic customer service from a Neil( didn't get his last name), he was fast and answered all my questions, he was the last push we needed to book our flights, and then after buying everything I got help from Miquel and Elena, they were very helpfull as well and replied my emails very quickly!For a first timer, I couldn't have asked for a better serivce.Céline
5	The best travel ticketing site in the planet.. excellent service and helpful information
5	Simple the Best, I always have used the Kiwi to buy and book my flights online and I never had a problem, but this time I couldn't do my check in to my flight from tomorrow early, so I went to the Kiwi website and just talked with Alaa, amazing person, polite and quick the agent explained everything to me and fixed my problem, thank you Alaa, thank you Kiwi From farway the Best ever
5	Regardless of what fees the individual airlines charge that you may not see up front, this is not about that mess. What is important for me is that when I called Skypicker to get helped out a gentleman named James Tickner was very helpful!! He handled my issues quickly and confidently. I now feel safe and sounded headed out tomorrow.
5	My trip it was from sharm el sheik to Oslo i just back  safe Home Yesterday.I want to mention the hero of Skypicker who is really a rule model and symbol of the travel agent.Aamer Tageldin for a week did extraordinary work and assist in making my trip safe and happy however all of the difficulty that happened.I want to say that Skypicker is lucky because they can dind such a man and really you are lucky because he is in your team.Again Aamer Tageldin you are more than a travel agent. You are a hero.Thank you so much and always skypicker look for employers like him.Professional and suuuper amazing :relaxed:Best regardsMahmoud Ibrahim
5	I made the booking with <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>, everything was smooth and convenient. I had few questions related to my flights and every concern was handled in professional manner and personal approach by 24/7 service, namely Radek helped a lot.Thank you, I am definitely going to book with kiwi next timeLibuse Pokorna
5	Tomas was really helpful with all my queries and worries about my upcoming flight! Really helpful that you can talk to people by instant chat :)
5	I really messed up my booking, and kiwi's kind employee Filip really helped me out with it! Thank you for your service.
5	I had a problem with changing the date about passports in the managing page. Unfortunately, I did not know how to do it. Mr Grzegorz - agent of Skypicker helped me a lot. He asked about my data, then changed the wrong information in my booking area. What's more, he explained me how the payment issue looks like, because I had problems with paying via internet using my credit card. He gave me lots of advice. The service was done very quickly. I can recommend this travel agent ;)Best regards to Mr Grzegorz! :)
5	I did not know how to put in my ID data. Tamara did a very good job by dealing in a very short time with my issue.
5	Skypicker is awesome ! They are a professionally run out-fit and provide a great service. I had mistakenly overlooked my flight confirmation details (which they had indeed sent). So I messaged them on their Facebook page and Lucy messaged me almost immediately with my flight details and also emailed me my itinerary again. She also offered any other personal assistance if I needed it. I was very impressed with this service. You talk to real people with Skypicker who want to provide you with the best possible service and can be any help they can. I will stay with this company for my flight as they save me time, money and give me peace of mind. You're awesome Lucy and the team at skyscanner.
4	Got a live chat from Radek. Very good and fast response.
5	I had several questions about checking in and adding baggage.  I used the chat service and Gabriella was most helpful.  She was quick, knew what she was doing, and was able to answer all my questions.  This is what customer service should be like.  Thanks much!
1	Kiwi has charges me 2 times!!! My cc has over limit 10 times frm original, how is possible??? Its like their trick!!! It suppose to be decline yesterday!!!I really really frustated about it
5	Elena was very helpful assisting me with adding luggage for my flight. I really like the live chat.
5	I had to change a only one of my flights from my itinerary. I hit the chat button and Patrik helped me, he was kind and comprehensive the entire time, thing that is not common in customers service. He made wait online while his parter Simon got us the change of the flight with no charge at all, I'm really grateful for the service that they gave us, and the team work. Thank you very much guys and kept up, because is really appreciated and not common nowadays. Congrats!
5	Thank you for helping with my problem with double reservation. Very profesional and helpful staff (Marry P.) and they working 24/7. Reccomended

5	Excellent service provided by <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com>. The customer care service answered promptly to our questions regarding the payment and visa. I appreciated they made the online check-in for me and sent the boarding pass by email. It was helpful. I already recommended <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> to my friends.
5	@skypickercom loving the way your flight search works
5	Great to have Renata and Lucie (and a few more whom i dun have their name) from chat customer representative who help me to solve my problem in my boss itinerary changes. Much appreciated.

5	When Ryanair stopped flight from Malta to Barcelona for the winter I was very disappointed for I was looking forward to fly with them with my wife to Barcelona in mid December.  Skypicker proposed the most economical and efficient alternative route of flying from Malta to Barcelona via Venice Treviso on same day with Ryanair.  Other websites suggested longer routes at much higher prices - up to four times more in some cases.  Skypicker helped me all the way by providing me with confirmation of payment, confirmation of booking, and boarding passes when check in for Ryanair flights was due after I supplied them with the necessary personal data.  Thank you Skypicker for a job well done.
5	She was so helpful and guided me through all my questions without hesitation. You are fantastic!-Liz C.
5	Best regards to everyone especialy to Eva for solving my problem
4	Easy, quick and professional!
5	Amazing customer service by Miguel Gudayol. Sometimes  when coordinating your travel arrangements situations may arise which  can affect your vacations in a negative way. Things aren't always perfect, as much as you would want them to be. The difference on how your total experience turns out has to do with the way the  service provider decides to handle the situation encountered. If your service provider has great customer service than what ever difficulties arise will seem minor and without consequence. If the service provider in the other hand makes things difficult for you the total experience could end up being a nightmare. I am happy to say that Sky Picker has an amazing customer service.  There was a situation with our reservation and Miguel Gudayol took quick control and did everything he needed to in order to make this seem like a glitch.  Thank you Miguel, we experienced Sky Picker through you and are very satisfied with the service. I will highly recommend Sky Picker.
5	Cintia SchelbauerTravel Consultant
5	I had trouble checking online so I decided to ask for help. I chat with Dorota and she was completely kind and helpful, in less than 5 minutes she helped me solved the issue and I end up with the boarding passes in my email. Thank you for the efficiency and great service.
5	This is the first time I have used SkyPicker and it won't be the last. The service was fast and efficient and the extra services that I requested  (extra baggage, allocated seats) were dealt with quickly and courteously.  I was very impressed.  I would highly recommend SkyPicker to anyone.
5	The worst what can happen to travellers can be to miss a connection flight, becuase another flight was to late. I have been stuck in Shanghai with 2 other <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> customers and we had a great assistance from Eleonore, David, Lukas and Sena. Although the chat connection was often interrupted all of them have been totally helpful and patient with us. We found the best solution to continue our journey and are on the way now to our final destination :) Thank you very much <http://KIWI.COM|KIWI.COM>
1	After my Athens - Santorini flight was changed from 16:55 to 12:05 midnight prior, over 16 hours earlier, I was told it was not possible to refund my itinerary or provide a flight that was even remotely close to the original schedule (one was given at 8, 9 hours earlier than my original schedule). For travelers who have planned months in advance and booked expensive hotels at these nice places, it's irresponsible and ridiculous to expect customers to just abide by such drastic changes to their itinerary. When asked for a refund, they refused to refund the entire itinerary. DO NOT BOOK with them unless your schedule is flexible enough to change flight times by more than 16 hours. They won't refund your entire flight and you'll be forced to pay more to try to match a new flight to their itinerary and yours. Low-cost is not worth the unreliability of flights.
5	We wanted to change our flight and there were difficulties with the booking process, but we had the Skypicker team on the phone, and they helped us change the filght to another company. They were very efficient and nice !
5	"I would like to comment both Ms Katerina G and Ms Petra M for their OUTSTANDING performance of their duties as Travel Consultants.  They responded in a quick and professional manner on my problem regarding the misspelled name of my wife in the ticket, eliminating dissappointment and heartache on my wife's part.  Despite the rigid policy of the airlines, they somehow made every effort to solve the matter without hesitation and with full heart into it.  This is a true presentation of a well-trained customer service personnel who can do the job right in every matter that arises.  Being a customer service supervisor for 22 yrs in the Navy myself, there performances were exemplary and it should serve as a model to all your employees who somehow are tasked dealing with people; i.e. how to respond tacfully, how to react to clients with rude personalities,, etc etc.  Ms Katerina G and Ms Petra M deserve more than just a pat on the back or plainly ""job well done""  I would strongly recommend a recognition and commendation, which satisfies and exhibits their OUTSTANDING performance.  What they did, as far as I am concern, is one of the greatest recruitment tool of service in your company. for sure, you will be recommended by me to my family and friends... again, my congratulations to these two well-deserved-excellent employees....RAYMOND B FERNANDEZ"

5	I did not have to deal with their customer service because my flights were on time,  but I felt much more relaxed for a <2h connection between two budget airlines. Will likely use them again, if I ever have to deal with delays I'll review again.
5	Dimitru was very nice to help me with my musical instruments.Thanks!
1	email for checking came too late, self-checkin at Ryanair impossible because <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> had changed my booking email address, cost me 45 EUR extra. Shame on you!!!
3	@skypickercom can't open my boarding pass in the Ryanair app. Would prefer to show it on mobile rather than paper. Can you help please?
5	I received help from Patrik Pivoda and it was nice experience. Fast responses and solved my problems.Getting cheap solutions for my trips from <http://skypicker.com|skypicker.com> and I will certainly use and recommend the site.
5	I had some trouble locating my reservation and got excellent service from Mohammed in helping me find it. He was extremely kind and helpful and put me at ease. Thank you, Mohammed. I really appreciate you helping me out.
5	I had some issues when paying however, the quick 24/7 chat allowed Elena to quickly assist me and all was booked without losing the 'best price' for the flights i wanted.It will indeed be a Merry Christmas. .
5	Thanks Issis for the great customer service! Your site is great!
5	Lorena! She helped me with the tickets. It's the first time I book a flight online and I was scared... but she was great at explaining me all the stuff and helped me with online check-ins! I will certainly visit this website again if I ever need to book a flight.
1	SkyPicker sold me a flight that had only one stop listed but in reality had two stops!  When I found the flight actually had two stops, I called them to fix the situation.  Not only would they not fix the situation, they tried to dismiss my claim saying that the flight time was accurate (that doesn't mean you can lie about other parts of the ticket!!).Horrible company with even worse customer service.  I'm surprised <http://Kayak.com|Kayak.com> cross-lists their flights but I'll be making every effort to make sure they don't based on this
4	I made an air booking on <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> and after receiving the email noticed that I had my nickname as my first name and that it did not match the name on my passport.  Recognizing that name changes are often difficult on airline tickets, I promptly contacted <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> via their chat app and the rep, Hanka Ch, called the airline and was able to have the name correctly within 5 minutes at no charge.  Overall I was provided wiht quick and excellent service.Overall a great value on the airline ticket, but there was a restriction in that the ticket although an e-ticket, does not allow online check-in and requires me to check-in with an agent of the airline at the airport.  A little inconvenient, but I have baggage anyways so not a big issue in this case.

5	Many thanks to Mr. Ondřej Pohl, I am very satistified with his help. I was ensured with his personal experience that I can make my 1.5h layover in Amsterdam.
5	Jonathan & Carlo has been helping me so much with all my requests. Thanks for all your help with my cancellation issues!!! I have feel a great care as a customer. Magnífico!
5	Petra Musilova was very helpfull and he got the things I needed to do very fast.
5	My sister and I were unable to be on our flight due to a horrible accident and James Tickner at skypicker did everything he could to help us out. Much appreciated...thank you!
5	Martin C was really helpful, my credit card was charged 3 times for the same booking and he solved it in 15mins, outstanding customer service!!
5	"We needed to book a ticket from Cuba to Moscow in under 48h notice, and skypicker had the best price and the shortest trip time of all airline ticket services looked at. We did change an airline,and had to re check the bags,  but our transfer time was perfect for this little ""inconvenience"".Highly Recommended!"
5	I bought my tickets to my travel in France but without a checked in baggage. So, with a week before my departure time o contacted <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> via LiveChat. A very nice person, Marina N, took my problem and after a few mins i had a list with all posibilities of checked in baggage. She detailed it so well and gave a lot of info. My concerns about my baggage just gone away.Thanks <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> and thanks for your great people!
4	very helpful live chat,I've been able to check in online less then 5 hours before the flight.Thanks Aleksandra!
5	Very good customer service. I have a little incident my flight and Lucie OBryan solved very well and is very friendly and hard worker. The next time I make a booking flight, it will be with <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com>.
5	I received excellent customer service from <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> this week. I had an accident and needed to postpone my flight. The staff at <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> had cancelled and rebooked a new flight within a couple of  hours of me contacting them, which relieved a lot of stress for me. I can not recommend them enough and will definitely book with <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> in the future.
5	I needed to manage my booking and I started a live chat with Emre T. who was very nice and helpful. Got my problem solved in a couple of minutes. Excellent service. Well done guys!!
5	This is my first time ever going through a travel company, I usually prefer doing things by myself and in the past haven't had any luck when inquiring with travel companies. I was a bit hesitant booking through a third party but all my worries are gone thanks to Tomas Muzik and all his help!! I called with an inquiry for my plane meal, I'm vegan and it can be quite difficult getting a plant friendly meal. Tomas said he would call the airlines to see what he could find out for me and he'd let me know in a few hours. Not only did he call me within the hour, he also spent the hour after that going back and forth between myself and the airlines trying to find any viable options for me and confirming all the options with me before requesting anything. In the end, after all his hard work we managed to find a meal I can eat on the flight home!! I honestly am feeling so very confident and happy to have booked with Kiwi and I'll definitely be using them again in the future :-) They always answer my calls within a reasonable time and the fact that they're available to call 24/7 is perfect for people like myself who work shifts! They've made booking SO easy, now I just have to sit back, relax and enjoy my flight.
2	Did not receive a confirmation Email or E-ticket. Beginning to think it is a scam.
5	I have had the best service from Mario :D He was very polite and very nice - he gave me the information I needed and I am happy to travel now - Thank you Mario :D
5	I contacted Kiwi chat and I was attended by Lucie Polivkova who kindly helped me about the check in and more questions I had! I didn't knew how to do that, and Lucie did that for me. Thank you so much!
5	OMG such a big issues with some delayed flights and Vendula was helping me online a lot! I cant say how much I appreciate the help! She was with me hours and kept me in a good way in this situation! everything is happened in the last minute! Amazing how people can make it better! Thank you so much!!!!
5	Easy way to choos flight ticket.
5	Filip is the most kind, helpful and enjoyable person found on <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>,from my experience solving problems with him on charge can also be fun.He really knows how to be friendly and proffesional on the same time. He kept me company when being on hold with the flight agency, and i didn't feel for one second that he was not there, trying his best to help me deal with my booking problem.Thanks a lot FILIP, iknow for sure that the next time i book through <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> you will help me out if needed perfectly as you did earlier!
3	@dannacampos I was curious if you ever found out if Skypicker is legit? Wondering the same thing
5	I discovered I'd booked a multiple flight international journey without checked baggage and was flying the next day. I used online support and spoke with Nina Turkian who sorted this all out for me. Life saver.
5	I have booked with <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> on a number of occasions always finding them to have excellent customer service.There attention to detail is spot on and nothing is to much trouble.Customer service representative Eric was very helpful when I needed some advise on my booking reference number 1558770Dieter Kollnberger
5	Excellent service of BabaK
5	Stanislav is a very good assistant he really saved me . Thank you...
5	I had a number of requests regarding my booking and I want to say especially thanks to the representatives who helped me..Thanks to Tomáš Mužík especially for doing the heavy liifting coordinating seat assignments between two flights so that I could sit with a friend.You guys are great-
5	I accidentally booked the wrong flight and contacted Skypicker for a cancellation immediately. The live chat was a helpful feature, staff responded swiftly and the process was very smooth.  The refund request for my booking was processed within less than an hour. Impressed! Thank you!
5	very good service! Thank u so much for the help Luis.S :)
5	<http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> were outstanding. From the day of booking until the day of travel, the company kept me informed and provided my boarding cards without me having to do anything. I will certainly use them again.
4	Hi,I booked a flight on <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>, and it happens that I had one stop to change flight/company. So it was a bit confusing because the second company had a smaller bag size limit, but it had the option to increase the bag size for a fee.  So I contacted Kiwi to know how I could do it. A lady named Saskia provided me help, she checked the size limits on both flights, she said that in fact the second company had an option to increase it and that she would provide me the link and price of the fee. After a minute or two she said that actually the large size was already included in my reservation so there was no nee for me to pay the fee, she also said I would receive new tickets with the correct bag size limits in less than 24h.  So, I got the help I wanted and the lady was very supportive, really fast and better than I expected, wasn't expecting the lady to contact the air company and all but she did it while I waited in the chat. And it was really fast. Great, I liked it, but I still have to fly so let's hope everything goes accordingly.
3	Our flight from Ibiza to FCO is delayed, which means we are definitely missing our important connecting flight from FCO to Toronto (and also Toronto to SFO).We paid several hundred dollars extra for this specific series of flights because we planned on being in Toronto for 12 hrs (there was a 12 hr layover). At this point, we are willing to accept any plan that gets us to Toronto and then be reimbursed the cost from Toronto to SFO.I have called customer support 3 times now. Staff was very friendly and understanding both times, but they promised to call me back within 2 hrs. I didn't get any calls back and when I called again, they told me they could not find any alternatives at all. There was some alternative mentioned that would strand us in Rome for a day, but then the agent said nevermind that won't work. Now they are telling us to take the delayed flight to Rome even though we have no other flight planned yet. I am worried and we are traveling internationally which is stressful.We have no accommodations and have been stranded at the airport in a very foreign country for hours now -- with no idea that we will ever make it back to home. Please  help us.
1	"I booked my ticket this afternoon but 10 minutes later, I received an email my booking had been cancelled. ""Prevented by a technical issue"". I tried to get in contact with the custom support by phone - not possible. After I tried to get in contact by chat, what took really long. There was no help from <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> at all and the only thing I heard was that there was nothing they could do, because Ryanair changed their prices. I can get a refund and that's all. The tickets are at the moment twice as expensive. I think it is absolutely crazy <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> sells tickets they don't have in stock and that it the customer who got affected."
5	I had typed in my email incorrectly and when I asked for help through Live Chat, The help I was provided by Emre was very quick and efficient. We received our tickets before my chat with Emre was finished. I also got amazing rates for a trip planned for February. Will definitely use the service again.
5	You can find almost any flights on Kiwi with the lowest prices around. Connecting flights and transits are arranged to a minimum.
5	I used the chat service of <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>, to add a service to my booking flight, wich was not possible to do on the website. They did everything for me, and sent me an email with the information and etc. The name of the worker was Tomas U, and he was very helpful.Thank you!
5	I appreciate the chat service : it is very useful thank you Sara
1	Worst experience ever!! This is a scam!They charge you double the price than on airline's website and after waiting 12 hours for your confirmation and many call attempts, you  get to airport and are not even registered on the flight!!One luck they had to switch planes and the airline figured out a way to get me on this flight Dozens of emails, calls, and still haven't been refunded!
5	thanks to Miroslava P for great custom service :)
5	Very nice and quikly response By phone. I had a problem with muy reservation flight and talking with mila udod it was solved in the proper way. For now exelent attention
5	Thanks to Filip for his help. He respond to all my question quickly and clearly!
5	Nina was able to get our flight rebooked quickly and easily.  Thank you!
2	RT @OlgaSzoke: This startup has an algorithm that finds discount flight tickets 'hidden' on airline websites <https://t.co/xvsdFvPYM0>
4	Hi... I talk with the live chat with your customer representative and they give really the convenient option appreciate you guys..spl jiri cerevenka thanks
5	We booked connecting Ryanair flights with <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> and everything went very smoothly. Even though we had two separate bookings, we arranged to sit together by contacting customer services and reserving seats. There was a fee for this but it was reasonable. The boarding passes arrived nicely in advance and everything was very efficient and easy.
5	"I had an unexpected change to my travel plans and I needed to change my travel date.   I called Kiwi and was connected with Iryna V. who was honestly the most helpful costumer service person I've ever talked to.  She was super clear in the steps I needed to do to change my travel date and in the end-   she actually called the airline for me and was able to make the change for a very small change fee.    I was expecting to be told ""You can't change your ticket and you can't get a refund"" but what the reality was was the exact opposite-    this is the best experience with a travel website I've ever had.   Thank you Iryna!!"
4	The direct communication has been good, with Pavel F and others. But I have had to call or write several times because the changes I asked for were not completed quickly and I was not informed of the progress, if any. Everything seems to be in order now, thank you.
2	"@skypickercom ""As far as our guarantee is concerned, I am sorry that we were not able to reimburse you for the flight you have purchased"""
5	Great guys! Special thanks to Natalya Petrishina for the great support and help with my flights! Great job! Keep up the great work and service. I am more than happy to be your customer.Thanks a lot!Rosana.
4	@skypickercom Hi Skypicker, thanks for the follow! Join over 10,000 other facebook followers here <https://t.co/bBng5nEhK0> Happy travels!
5	I was served at online-chat with Natalia. She helped me very much, as she waited to confirm my tickets totally and got my confirmation immediately, much faster than usual. I can not tell you how pleased I am. It was the best service I have ever had on an online agent, cause usually there is much mess. I am very very pleased. Recommended!
5	Kiwi helped me a lot with my booking. And I wish you to be followed by Aliz, really effective !
4	Great booking experience, very intuitive website, smooth process, very interesting fares. The lady I spoke to at Customer Support was very professional and reassuring. Just one suggestion: I think they should update their payment procedure, as there sometimes can be a delay of up to 4h until you get your confirmation and the e-tickets + boarding passes.
1	I booked a flight for $480 which included $80 additional cancellation insurance.  I ended up cancelling the flight almost 3 months before the flight date.  They offered me 90 Euros.  $125. I called the company before I booked the ticket and they said if I bought the insurance it wouldn't be a problem cancelling the ticket.  I read the fine print on their policies and there was no indication that I was going to receive basically 10% of the ticket price.  I have received no other correspondence after I complained that it wasn't acceptable refund amount.Request for refund # 1558974
4	We didnt know what the document number was, now we know thanks to dorota, she was very helpful and kind.
5	Thank you youssef for your fast and helpful service, I received our coding passes in a really quick time and I recommend Skypicker
1	It's too expensive !Why do i pay £40.64??I heard that it will cost just £17.<http://m.blog.naver.com/chu86ayu/220486561022>
5	I've booked tickets with Skypicker twice now. Didn't have any issues either time and got the cheapest price for my bookings by far. The second time I booked I decided to change my booking to another day. Michaela from the online chat was very helpful and I moved my flight back for a reasonable fee. Overall very happy with the service and would recommend.
5	Needed some help with our booking and Valentin took care of it. Very pleased with the chat service. Valentin was very helpful. Great customer service!
2	A startup that finds discount flight tickets 'hidden' on airline websites just launched in the US <https://t.co/Nvw95UiRH9>
1	WORST COMPANY EVER!I am having the worst experience with Skypicker at the moment. First we had a morning flight from Hanoi to Ho Chi Minh City this morning at 7:55am with Vietjetair and they simply cancelled the flight without noticing us. We were able to take another flight, without their help, and now that we are at Ho Chi Minh City we had a connection to Singapore at 12:55 and this flight just doesn't exist. We are not the only one in this situation and no one is helping us. I spoke to 8 different persons on the phone and have been waiting for more than 5 hours and still no solutions founded. No one is doing anything. There were 5 flights leaving from HCMC to Singapore this afternoon, but Skypicker did not help us to be on one of these flights. I am seriously about to file a complaint and sue your company if you don't do something. Call me right now +84 96 4668624.
5	"I wanted to make a quick change to my itinerary a day after booking and was scared it would be difficult especially bc I couldn't call the euro number from my American phone. WRONG! Jan Lukasek is my hero! The live chat feature is great! Someone very patiently and coherently walked me thought the steps to try it myself and when the form said ""error"" Jan awesomely filled it out for me and made sure that my request went through. And is giving me updates!! Who does that?! No one!! In a world of terrible customer service reps, I'm super impressed and amazed! Thanks Kiwi and THANK YOU JAN!!"
5	I was contacted by phone as one leg of my upcoming trip had to be rescheduled. The proposed change was in conflict with my existing reservations, and the Kiwi representative worked to quickly and professionally find a convenient alternative flight. Follow through was professional and speedy. Thank you Kiwi for first class service!
1	"I am quoting one of the fair reviewers that had the same experience previously.""Jacob Borch Storper reviewed Skypicker — 1 starYesterday at 11:02am · I have now tried to book two tickets with the same result. The web page showed a price, but when the order was confirmed and my money was withdrawn from my account, I get a message two hours later saying that there has been a price change on the ticket of approximately +25% extra. I then have the option of accepting this price change or get my money back, just be aware that the reverse transaction can take up to 10 working days. I then look at the web page and see the exact same flight, now just cheaper than before.. I ask the support team if they can just change my booking to that one, disregarding the lower price - so I don't have to make a double transaction from my account, but the answer is just the standard: ""you can only chose between the two"".I then chose to get my money back (in 10 working days) and order a new, cheaper, ticket. Same thing happens, only that it takes them three hours to tell me the exact same thing again.I read in one of skypicker's replies to a Trustpilot-comment, that the airplane company changes prices up to 12 times a day? - well, no wonder the price changed in my booking if it took them three hours just to get the tickets... I am now forced to buy a more expensive ticket somewhere else because I can't trust their service. The whole concept of their business is really good; offering cheaper solutions, but when it doesn't work, it doesn't work (I am glad that it did for someone). Maybe they should hold the transaction of people's money until they actually confirm the bookings? My experience of buying a ticket from Skypicker is like lending money to a total stranger, with negative interests, and hoping to get them back (a bad business, if you ask me).I can only give them 1 star, based on the fact that I was not able to purchase a ticket without an added price on 25% after buying them, and plane tickets from the Philippines to Europe are not cheap.The worst thing about it all; the price is at it cheapest now on their web page, 12 hours later after first trying to book it.""Worst company, they did the same exact thing to me. DO NOT use this scam company in located in Czech Republic (CZ). They set a price, bill you, then send you an email of a price increase a few hours later."
5	I am very satisfied with the service Skypicker provided me. Everything went great with my booking and journey. And I would definetely going to buy more flights with them, I recommend this company 100%.
5	"I called because I couldn't purchase my check in baggage and one of the representatives ""Martin Ch"" gave me an excellent customer service. He ensured that my baggages were paid for by sending me a link to make payment and this made the whole experience easier.  Big thanks to Martin Ch"
5	Grzegorz from Skypicker was very helpful when I had questions on how to change flight for one of the passengers!
4	Excellent Support. I still have to catch the flight!
5	Everything was as it should be. <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> even checked us in before leaving for the airport (for those flights where it was possible) and sent us the boarding passes. I've never tried that before, but it made it much easier.
5	Great company in touch with the needs of their customers!!
5	Easy to find flights at resonable cost.
1	This company is such a rip off!!! I bought a ticket for my brother going to Auckland and its hell of stress that we encounter. When you do the booking it didnt state that the meal are not included. My brother's name was listed incorrectly in eticket but the booking confirmation has the correct name. We email skypicker support to add the meal but we disnt get a response. You cannot save money buying tickets here!!! They will rip you off and heaps of extra charges!!! Aside from that the CSR's from Czech are really hard to understand.Please do not buy tickets on this website anymore or else you end up paying more and so much stress.
1	I was in airport today ! And traveling from Jordan to Sydney.. The controller of airplane told me there is no ticket for your transit flight I missed my flight I lost my damn flight ! ... Kiwi is soooooooooo bad service also sooooo bad customer service
5	Very helpful and talented workers, Anna K and Tomas U. I am very satisfied with how they managed to help me with me flight problems. Very professional and quick help.
4	I had my flight at 22.20 and, as I usually do, I left the check-in for the last day, at 8am. Unfortunately in Kiwi the check in can be done only until 72h before the flight, that meant that I had to check in in the airport at a very high price (my flight was not direct but combined). However, here came so helpful the online support by chat and.the guy who answered my questions was really helpful, he checked me in the flights without hesitating.
5	It was very easy to make my flight reservations and the prices where the best. I compared with more than one company. I mistakenly typed in the incomplete passport number and the customer service personel helped me very quickly and politely. The call dropped and they even called back! That was surprising and releaving.Thank you skypicker! You are now my favorite flight reservation site!
5	I was not aware of <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>'s policy on making changes to your reservation. 26 Hours before my flight I realized I needed to check a bag because only one leg of my flight included a free checked bag. However, within 15 minutes of entering a live chat with Lusine I had a checked bag and all of my questions answered. Lusine was both attentive to all of my concerns, and quickly able to walk me through the process online. I am very appreciative of the service I was provided with, a thousand thank-yous Lusine!

2	"My girlfriend and I had booked a package deal with SkyPicker from Copenhagen to Tagbilaran. Our plane from Dubai-Manila was 1,5 hours late, which caused us to miss the flight from Manila-Tagbilaran.In they package deal SkyPicker had only calculated 2 hours for us to change planes in Manila. However according to the airlines travel-recommendation we should have been in the airport 4 hours before departure. Had they followed recommendations, we would have made the flight.Due to the missed flight, we had to spend a night in Manila, purchase a new (and more expensive) ticket and only had additional costs for taxe to/from the airport and alike.When stranded in Manila airport, we contacted the one (and only) emergence number, SkyPicker had given us, but the number was ""out of order"".When we finally got ahold of SkyPicker, they would only refund our original ticket from Manila-Tagbilaran. However, this goes against Danish compensation legislating where we are entitled to a full compensation calculated as the positive contractual interest, whereby the party seeking compensation will be placed as if the contract was performed successfully. What SkyPicker did was calculate our compensation as the negative contractual interest, whereby the party seeking compensation will be placed as if the contract was never concluded.Actually, we were also entitled to compansation of the value of one vacation-day as the day was ruined with hour upon hour of waiting in the airport and finding a place to spend the night. We offered to waive this right in an exchange for a quick refund of our money.We had a long correspondence with SkyPicker about this, where they did not respond to ANY of our legal arguments. They kept saying, that they were not responsible because we had not contacted them before purchasing the new ticket - but 1)we tried to contact them on the only number we had and 2) they had already agreed to be responsible by refunding our original ticket.Eventually we gave up communicating with them, and are currently considering moving forward with the case to the Danish board of consumer complaints.Despite the above, we always received quick and polite responses from the SkyPicker support team! Our problem is with the financial/legal department and not the support!"
1	"DO NOT USE THIS COMPANYConfusion - language barriers and time zone barriersUnethical - would not disclose flight information which is usually disclosed by airlines on e-tickets. Booking reference number given was not recognised by the airlines when I called them myselfUseless - they couldn't offer me any solutions to my problems (probably partially due to the above under ""confusion"")Airlines were fantastic and easy to deal with once I removed the middle-man (Skypicker)Lesson learned - deal directly with airlines from the start!!!"
4	Tks to Tomas for his kind help. Good job !
5	Was just taken through the process of what happens now I have made my online booking by Alan Whitfield. Polite, detailed and a sense of someone who cares about their role. Very refreshing to be treated courteously and not at all irked by my flight related OCD need for tiniest detail that I get when booking flights online.Thank you!!
1	"I have bought my ticket (two separate flights: Bari-Rome via Ryanair, Rome-London via Norwegian International) online on the late evening of the 6th of November, little did I know that, factually, I only had a little window of just over 12 hours, from the moment the flights where confirmed via email to 'closing time', for me to enter my Passport details and complete the check-in online.When I clicked on the check-in link from their email I was greeted with this message in bright red:""Please fill in your passport/ID details so that we can check in online for you. Otherwise, you will need to check in at the airport which may be subject to a fee of up to 70 € depending on the airline. It is only possible to fill in these details before 2016 Nov 07, 13:05 UTC"".My flight was scheduled precisely at 14:05 on 2016 Nov 10, so basically I could no longer enter my details still a whole 73 hours before departure, what kind of joke is this???!The only clickable option was a link marked ""Print your e-ticket and bring it with you to the airport for check-in"" which resulted in 4 PDF pages of general info and rules which I printed and took to the airport.I have bought flights straight from the Ryanair site before and do know for a fact you can easily do the online check in for no charge just few hours before flying so no idea how they justify that rule anyway but, to cut it short, I had to fork out an extra 50 Euros at the airport for the privilege of getting a rectangular version of the ticket that should have cost me just a bit more than half as much.To had insult to injury on the page where I (theoretically) could have done the check-in, on the same morning of my due flight, another link with the ""Print all available boarding passes"" heading appeared below the previous one. Clicked on it and was greeted with a completely blank PDF document, no browser error there: I have opened it in several ways and it was just a 2 paged white sheet, blank as my expression of disbelief for such insulting online travel experience.Fastest customer you've ever gained and lost, congratulations. <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>."
4	I was looking everywhere for a cheap flight to Portugal and then came across a very good price on Skypicker. It was easy to use and allowed me to choose the exact times for my stop-over in Brussels. It is uncomplicated and informed me about when I needed to check in so that I did not have to pay extra charges with Ryanair. Very easy to use with very good pricing offers - a great service.
1	The worst experience ever that I have had with this company. Unbelievable .....
5	Thanks to Puput for all help. Good work Puput!
5	I spoke with Sabi J today who did an outstanding job helping me and calm me down of my concerns, which I had presented. She had answered all questions very intelligently and efficiently. In addition, she went above and beyond and chose to work on my file past the time she was supposed to leave the office. This kind of dedication and kindness is worth my of a big thank you!Much appreciated,Alex

5	<http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> employee Igor Guzvinec on their live chat feature helped us to check into our flight late. I really felt he went the extra mile, was really friendly and helped us save money at the airport. Thanks for working your magic Igor!
5	Yes, just one word for <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> that is Reliable. I had once booked my tickets from Singapore to Bangalore via Chennai. But when I landed in Chennai, a heavy cyclone with strong winds took over the city and all the flights in the Chennai airport was cancelled for almost 24 hours including mine :(I called up Kiwi and informed them about the situation and to my surprise Kiwi booked another flight next day without any additional charges. In fact they even told that I could claim the food expenses up to 50 Euros. I am very much thankful to Kiwi for getting my flight rescheduled. A wonderful service was offered by the travel consultant - Lukas. I have recommended many of my friends about Kiwi. But, it would be great if Kiwi had a toll free or local number as it will be helping the International travellers as their cell might not work out of their home country.Please keep up the good work guys and All the Best !!!!
5	If you're looking for quick bookings with the cheapest price possible, Skypicker can help! Just don't forget your booking number (just in case you lose your flight itinerary) Their agents are very helpful as well. Just make sure you have the proper information needed to track your flights.

No waiting time and easily understood people who helped me.Second time I never recived my confirmation of buying the ticket home so I tried the chat and a nice guy Pedro fixed my misstake on putting the rigth email adress in minutes!Amazing and hardly any waiting time!! :) My favourite booking side!
4	Buying tickets is easy, intuitive and user-friendly. Unfortunately, I had to contact support because the web site is missing the way to change invoice details (my suggestion - please add it, that would help a lot of customers tremendously). But all in all, support has been very efficient and helpful and I could get it done in no time with their help.
5	Contacting the support was easy and they were very efficient in helping me find a rebooking at no additional cost.My only issue is that doing this in a foreign land where I have to use my own home phone services proved to be as expensive as funding a new flight. My telephone bills shot up to more than $300.Can I ask <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> if this can be reimbursed.
5	Great price with great support. Worth booking with these guys as their guarantee provides you with same level of coverage as the legacy carriers at a fraction of the cost.
1	Very dissapointed because we had to pay extra  for missing passport number at the booking. There was no information where to register and the tickets were ok as the luggage was checked in. I will warm you for this company!
4	The service was put to the test when I was stranded half-way to my destination. The next flight was postponed to the next day and there were no available flight in transit by the same airline till 1 week time. The staff at SkyPicker could easily understood my situation when contacted and were very professional in handling my case. Within 3 hours they managed to resolved my problem by providing alternative routes and airlines to reach my destination. It was a big relief even though I reached my destination a day late (which caused 1 day hotel charge plus 1 day no-show car rental).
3	No explanetion about the cansellation and how I will get new tickets.
5	They have an excellent customer service always willing to help and with a quick response.
4	I contacted them because I had accidentally typed in the wrong email address, and not received my confirmation email. The first time I got connected the agent closed down the help window without answering my query. But the second time I got through to a very helpful person, who changed the email address for me in a few minutes, and I got my confirmation. All in all very helpful and nice staff.

4	We booked a few domestic flights in our visit to australia with skypicker in Feb 2016.  Overall, had a great experience with skypicker. There is some merit in choosing professional agencies/ aggregators like these to manage your travel as they can cover for exigencies like missed flights / delays, besides providing value added services like cost competitive ticket combinations, check ins etc. Due to some confusion, I and my wife were left stranded at cairns airport in the middle of a night and were absolutely certain we will miss our return leg flights, besides incurring terrible emotional and financial pain to get back to singapore. This was before we got in touch with an angel/ rock star Jonathon at skypicker. Jonathon spent close to 4-5 hours with me over the phone in a days shift, came up with some great options and in the end helped design a solution which was win -win for both the parties. Most importantly, I and my wife felt we were talking to a considerate person who is really concerned with our situation and is genuinely interested in helping us. That is quite a useful feeling to have when you are so worked up.. I also liked the fact that Jonathon was very objective in telling me what he can do and what he can't. Over promise and under-delivery in a tense situation like this is a big problem. What matters is that at the end of the day, Jonathon/ team were able to retain me as a future customer despite things going south. I will feel more confident doing business with skypicker in future, fully knowing they have a good team of agents who will watch your back when crisis hits! Happy customers - Sarvagya and Tushita
5	Miroslava has been wonderful in helping and patient in answering all the querries. Sorted out my seating and meal plan for all connecting flights.Jacob who i have been chatting in the afternoon also very helpful. when my connection got disconnected, he made sure to send an email to me without fail. Much apprecaite your time .
5	Just a small feedback that it was a pleasure to have the support of Lucie R. to make sure that I've got my 2 different boarding passes from my connected flight tomorrow. Keep up the good work guys!
5	Extremely good pricing and excellent Customer Support. My agent ( Seth Alex) solved all my issues quickly and answered all additional questions I had accordingly :)
5	Fast and accurate services! My new favorite booking company! :) Thanks to my travel consultant Mary P. I'm more than satisfied.
3	George Kofoulis is a relative with shares in the company
5	Great Service!!!
5	We needed an invoice and Lenka was nice, patient and responsive. We solved quickly the situation. Good questions and clear answers!
4	Dear, all the services are good, thanks
5	Thank you so much Kateryna S for the excellent service support!
1	Highly unprofessional and an absolute disgrace! Haven't encountered a company as dysfunctional and disappointing as skypicker!
5	Quick, professional, very friendly
5	Flying from koh samui to Da nang vietnam  three flight process middle flight cancelled so new flight time over run last flight so that had to be changed in accordance which was NO PROBLEM FOR TEAM SUPPORT WITH EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE ALL SORTED WITH IN COUPLE OF HOURSTHANK YOU SOOOOOO MUCH
5	Anastasia was very nice and very helpful
5	The process is very fast and simple. The agent (Ms.Martina) can help to solve my problem between invoice and receipt very well.
1	Sorry guys, but ive been lured on 105pounds, and the ticket i bought wasnt even Worth it when i look at it now. After i bought my ticket for 280 Pounds, i had to buy 105pound extra baggage. However inbe4 i bought the ticket it never stated me that i had to buy extra if i wanted to bring with me 15kg with me. I tought it was all normal and i had found a great ticket. But later when i check i had to buy 15kg baggage for 105 Pound?!?!?!?! I was like wt.f i could travel with THY all the way to my destination if i had been adin 150pound. This is the last time i ever use a Agency service or anything like that! FROM NOW ON ONLY BUYING TICKET FROM THE AIRLINE PAGES.
4	The flights were much cheaper when I checked with Kiwi.Plus was super easy to use - took 3 minutes to book the flights!
5	Im verry happy wel done guys keep doing that good work im verry satisfied for the first time i hear a automaticly cheking in and that you have the chance to choise between the payment well done
5	Hi everybody,Jan Lukasek was fast and furious. Sharp and precise. Like a super smart robot! Wait a second.....All the stars reviews! Top class!PS: Pegasus is a bit confusing as a flying horse would be.
4	"I would like to start by saying that if it wasn't for Petra M. I would have rated this a negative star because it didn't even deserve 1 star! After booking my flight, I was trying to secure my seats but I wanted to have some kind of upgrade. On the site it tells you to put in a request and they will do it for you and then you pay. Well how am I supposed to request something that I don't even know?!? I needed to speak to someone to know what my options were. I called and spoke to an incompetent lady that just went around in circles saying I had to put a request online because she couldn't do it (apparently her role there is being overpaid for doing nothing, since she can't actually help customers). She swore they would contact me immediately. Over 2 days later and my seat options dwindled... I went online and saw there was an online chat option. That's where I met Petra M. and she saved the day! She was able to help me with all of the different questions that I had (and there were A LOT lol). She was able to bill my account for my upgrades and sent me a link so I could do it right then and there!!! There was no waiting for god knows how long! Now that's the service I was looking for and expect from a company in the service industry. That whole ""request form"" thing is not user friendly and to be honest it makes the company look like they don't care about their customers or the needs and wants. Maybe instead of the request form they should just tell everyone to go on the online chats, since the people on the phone are just as incompetent as the request forms. All in all Petra M. Saved this review by her outstanding service and patience with me. I love how she kept typing ""I am here for you"", that really makes you feel like there is someone in this company that actually cares about what you want and will help you. Petra M. Is Fabulous! She deserves a raise! Maybe take some away from her phone people that don't help anyone and give it to her! lol"
5	Skypicker was extremely quick and helpful making an amendment to my ticket.  They were also very pleasant to deal with.  I feel like their customer service has been phenomenal thus far and have no issues with recommending them to others.
4	I am thankful to Jiri Cervenka helped me with lot of patience about my wife journey,i am comfortable now after i got solution for my issues thanks to jiri once again hope this your suggestios will work at the airlines thankyouPradeep

5	The customer service was very good, they attended to my needs right away. They were clear on their instructions and told me to be patient and they will have a solution for me.
5	Nikola H helped me check in online. His service is very attentive
1	I have booked twice now with Kiwi, both times I have gotten an email a few hours later asking me for more money to keep my booking.  That not only sounds unprofessional, it sounds illegal.  While they will probably tell me that my full refund is sufficient, its not.  There were other booking opportunities for similar prices that are no longer available.  If it is true that airlines sometimes change their price as the explanation email claims, it seems to follow that <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> is based on a poor algorithm as online bookings should be fairly instant.  I travel at least twice a month for work, and Kiwi is the only agent that seems unable to perform its sole function.
5	This review is meant specifically for JAMES who was incredibly helpful just now via the customer service telephone line. THANKS JAMES! x
4	I booked an international flights touching multiple European countries as well as India through kiwi. When I was in need of immediate alternative flights the 24/7 chat was at my service. All three representatives were polite and helpful, I was able to re-book the flight. A flaw was the wifi is required for the chat help, and not all airports have reliable or even available wifi. Otherwise, great help.
5	Good price, Petra from the customer service is really helpful. I recommend
5	I´d like to thank one more time for telephone support of your employee - Monika Fábryová. I had some doubts about baggage regulations and she made a great effort in finging out solutions to all questions I had. Her attitude was charming, funny and very friendly at the same time. I´m looking forward to traveling by kiwi again thanks to such a nice service as well :)
5	I travel a lot and always search my flight tickets through websites.Now that I found Skypicker I have it in the very top of my bookmarksand will search first of all (if not only) with it.Numerous choices, very cheap prices and the best of all,very quick, professional and accurate service to what I needed.Thank you Skypicker.
2	I was booking a flight which worked fine. It was a great service until i wanted to check it on ryanairThe flightnumber was correct but i couldnt do the check in cause my booking number wasnt found. I got an email from skypicker that they would to the check-in. (one week before the flight, which i have never seen before, only 1 day before the flight).So I'm not even sure if my flight does exist.
5	I had a complicated issue (actually due to a small random glitch in the Kiwi system) but Patrik was more than helpful! He did some extra research and double checked to make sure that the information he was telling me was correct. Thanks!
4	My customer representative, Eric, repair my mistake, make my chekin at telefon. Thank you verry much

4	Dmitriy Kondik helped me after my original flight was rescheduled due to volcanic ash in the area. I notified Kiwi of the issue and I told Dmitri it was very important to me to arrive in time for my family's Halloween cultural celebration. Initial searches had me arriving in my home country a day later and I had even agreed to the option. Then in a surprise phone call Dmi called me back and said he had found a flight which would get me home in the nick of time. It was so great to be able to walk around with my niece and nephew to collect candy!The only reason I didn't give 5 stars was the fact that it took us a very long time to come up with an alternate plan.
5	one of my best experience with my booking. just simple and quickly
5	Just got best customer service in my life to book my flights! can recommend to everyone!
5	I want to thank Rodon for his excellent assistance : fast and very helpful

5	Great customer service! I will keep using your site.
4	Thank you was a bit worried about the meals but all sorted out now.
5	Kiwi is excellent to book your flights through - through many filter and booking options you are sure to have a good overview of the flights in general and pick the ideal one for yourself! The booking and paying process is short and simple. Ideal to use when booking multiple flights.
5	Simple, good and fast customer service by Pavel. Keep going!

5	Despite many problems suddenly born, and with the fear of losing so loved trip of a lifetime, they have managed to keep their promise to get me in Scotland. Rapid agents, polite, friendly, and many other fine qualities found especially on Mr.Tomáš MuÅŸík (thanks for your invaluable help).Only known to be improved and the Italian service that can not open at 9 in the morning, do not ask a 24 hour service but at least a longer service.excellent company
5	You are an amazing site good luck!
5	Yesterday i booked a flight from Las Palmas to Oslo and everything with the booking went smooth until i got the ticket on my email where it said that i was MR.Julie Welde. I all of a sudden remembered that it was my own fault, because i forgot to Write that i wass MS.Julie Welde by an accident! So i picked up my phone and called Skypicker's customer service, and i got in contact with a very helpful and friendly called Ondra Pohl. I told her what happened, and she said she would try to change my title, but that there might be a fee for the change, This morning i got an email from Ondra and a new updated ticket free of charge! :) I was super happy, and i just have to say that Skypicker's customers service is really great
4	I had a problem with my flight ( it was cancelled) and i had i talk in the chat with Eva and she was very pleasant to help me to find the better solution for my case.Tks
5	The flight booking service was great.We were in a bind to find a good flight last minute for our vacation. Cheapest prices were on <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> compared to all other sites.We will definitely use this service again!
5	A day after I realized I made a mistake when entering my passport information. This could've caused me some BIG trouble. Within minutes of logging on to the live chat my  problem was solved, by a friendly and knowledgeable agent. It has been a long time since an online company has exceeded my expectations.10 stars for Kiwi!
5	I made some mistakes regarding some travel information and Enri A. quickly, professionally and politely solved them. What more could you ask for?
5	I thank Lenka very much for clarifying all my doubts and giving my full attention to my requests.Lenka, thank you so much for your time.
1	"IT MAY SEEM LIKE A DISCOUNT BOOKING AGENT, BUT YOU WILL PAY MORE IN THE LONG RUN DUE TO <http://KIWI.COM|KIWI.COM>'S INCOMPETENCE:<http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> is a website which purports to book flights for consumers, which means that they are, by the law, ""agents.""  They claim to have customer support, which I'm sure works well for the majority of flights, where customers need no support.  But, if you happen to be in the minority of flights, where you need customer support, GOOD LUCK WITH <http://KIWI.COM|KIWI.COM>.  THEIR AGENTS ARE RUDE, SLOPPY AND UNHELPFUL.If you happen to become ill, prior to your flight, the airline is generally more than willing to provide a refund or exchange (in part to protect the rest of the passengers from catching your illness).  This was my case.  Through <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>, I was asked to provide a copy of my medical certificate, which I promptly did.  <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> indicated that the airline was satisfied with the quality of the certificate and would process the refund WITHIN 30 BUSINESS DAYS AND THEN I WOULD HAVE TO WAIT AN ADDITIONAL 10 BUSINESS DAYS FOR <http://KIWI.COM|KIWI.COM> TO PROCESS THE REFUND ON THEIR END.  I waited and waited and heard nothing.  Finally, I contacted <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> and their rude customer service agents told me that the airline did not like the quality of my medical certificate, BUT THAT <http://KIWI.COM|KIWI.COM> COULD OFFER NO FURTHER DETAILS ABOUT ADDITIONAL DOCUMENTATION I NEED TO PROVIDE IN ORDER TO SATISFY THE AIRLINE.  THE INCOMPETENT ""CUSTOMER SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE TOLD ME <http://KIWI.COM|KIWI.COM> HAS NO DUTY TO PROVIDE THIS INFORMATION AND THAT I SHOULD CALL THE AIRLINE.  I called the airline, which told me that they are only able to provide this information to <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>, and will do so, only upon <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>'s request.  JUST A PIECE OF ADVICE TO <http://KIWI.COM|KIWI.COM>, BEING A BOOKING AGENT MEANS YOU DO HAVE A LEGAL DUTY TO HELP YOUR CUSTOMER BY ACTING AS AN AGENT AND PROVIDING RELEVANT INFORMATION TO YOUR CUSTOMERS, FROM THE AIRLINE.Unfortunately, for <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>, this may have been their unlucky transaction.  I happen to be a lawyer and I am currently considering taking this action to court, if I do not receive a refund within the next two weeks.  BASED UPON THE SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF SIMILAR NEGATIVE EXPERIENCES ABOUT <http://KIWI.COM|KIWI.COM> AND THEIR PREDECESSOR <http://SKYPICKER.COM|SKYPICKER.COM>, I AM CONSIDERING FILING THIS AS A CLASS ACTION LAW SUIT.<http://KIWI.COM|KIWI.COM> STOP RIPPING CUSTOMERS OFF THROUGH UNACCEPTABLE, INATTENTIVE AND UNRESPONSIVE ""CUSTOMER SERVICE.""  YOU ARE AGENTS BY THE LAW AND YOU HAVE THE LEGAL DUTY TO ACT ACCORDINGLY.* On a side note, I also suspect many of the positive reviews below are fraudulent and posted by agents if independent contractors of <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> *"
5	Anton helped me with past 48h check in. Great experience.
5	The help agent is so effective and friendly. Helpful of course. I dealt with two agents. Jiri and Filip. Thank you Filip for solving all the problems.Good Job!!
1	Very disappointed with @skypickercom Booked from NZ to India have to check out and re check bags back into every country on way. Not cool!
4	Just had a little breakdown because I thought I was too late with my online booking but turns out Eva saved the day! Thanks alot for being patient and understanding and keep up the great work :)
5	Thanks Aura.I am very glad with your management.Too with the management of Gabriela.
4	Thanks for helping me with my cancelled flight, Jonathan!
5	Quickly responds to email sent and do not have to hold for long time, if you need to call them. Really appreciate excellent service, esp. as boarding pass was also emailed and I could change my flight schedules, without any dramas. Strongly recommend for all future travels.
5	Was assisted by Miroslava P, that helped me check in online even though it was a few hours to late to do that. Very much appreciated :)
3	@KimDotcom bro i need your help. This @skypickercom is cheating people in name of there terms of service. Please see what you can do.

5	Fast, very polite chat. All I asked was solved in just a minute. Thanks to Aurelija.
5	Outstanding customer service and a really unique flight search system (their radius feature and anytime options are just brilliant). Highly recommended!
5	I had some troubles with my baggage and used the kiwi live chat. Jakub talked to me and was really helpful. He answered all of my questions and then asked if he could help me with anything else. It was really helpful and Jakub cleared everything for me about my trip. Wonderful to have this live chat and good people that answers you.
1	I have allways used skypicker before without any problems...But this time I was traveling with my girlfriend we both had 2 hand luggage as it said on our tickets  but when we arrive at the airport.. we look like fools, they wouldn't let us enter with 2 so we had to throw out clothes and so on, to fit everything together....After that there rude customer service refuse to admit there mistake...Last time I will ever use them, and I will tell my friends to stay away
5	I had no hold ups when  booking tickets  arrived no troubles at all  I would recommend  skypicker to all my friends
5	To find good flights and hotel rooms, try these 2 search engines: <https://t.co/CGYAs0kGtq> and <https://t.co/T8awqtcfnU> #campaignfordeflation
5	I emailed skypicker late in the evening regarding further information about my booking and if I could change a flight. I received a response that same night which I was pleasantly surprised about, as I needed the information that same day too. Very helpful!!
5	316387 emreShe is very good stuff and offer nice service .reply very soon as well nice job
5	This is the first time i did a online booking. and a friend recommended me this site. i contact them through their live chat and they were really helpful. i am amazed that live chat is so active and so fast. After purchasing the ticket i found that i have given the wrong information about one passenger so i contact them through live chat again, but without much hassle their much experienced Staff helped me through the procedure. they said they will take 3 days but in 2 days they have sent me the right ticket. i am happy that i took my tickets through u and hope to write a great review after our honeymoon.. so far i would say your service is a five star service.(ie: during live chat i found that i contacted most of the time with one particular person so i would like to thank Alex a lot.) thank you all the staff of skypicker you are doing a great job there.
5	Great customer service! thank you Rita for your full support and fast reactions on all my questions.
5	I contacted skypicker for help with my booking. Talked to Martin Carter and he ccouldn't have been more helpful and kind. He went above and beyond to help me. Will book through skypicker the next time i travel
5	I booked a round trip flight for two people a couple of months ago, and needed to change the return date for one of the passengers.  I was not given a choice on line to do this.  Called customer service and Eric was able to give me excellent service.  Although the ability to change the return date for only one passenger was not an option, he looked for, and found, another alternative which worked, with very little out of pocket expense and no hassle for me.  Thank you Eric, and kudos to you!!!
5	Just booked a flight! Cheapest website with great people at the help chat.
1	"I bought an airplane ticket from Trinidad to Copenhagen on <http://KIWI.COM|KIWI.COM>. It involved three flights - all low-cost airlines. I missed the second airplane although I could not have made it faster. The plane I arrived with were delayed and the following departure had been rescheduled. The airline had planned this for a month but <http://KIWI.COM|KIWI.COM> never informed me about it. The check-in counter was closed and I stranded in Toronto late at night.I called <http://KIWI.COM|KIWI.COM> and asked for help. They wanted me to mail evidence of the errors before they would help me. I tried to contact the airlines, but could not get in touch with anyone because of the late hour. I called several times to <http://KIWI.COM|KIWI.COM> (almost 100 EURO due. roaming charges). I ended up paying food, a hotel room and a new, EXPENSIVE flight the following night. I also had to pay for an extra day off at work and did not sleep for two whole days. My vacation was ruined.When I got home I wrote to <http://KIWI.COM|KIWI.COM> again asking them to at least pay for my expenses. 38 days later I finally got this answer:""We are truly sorry about the inconveniences you've had. We find, however, that you had enough time to reach the plane. We understand your frustations and assure you that we care for our customers. If you have any further questions please do not hesitate to contact us 24/7 via chat, email or phone"".I bought the journey of <http://KIWI.COM|KIWI.COM> because they were the cheapest. That decisino ended up being a VERY EXPENSIVE and ruining my vacation... I ADVISE NOT TO BUY ANY TRAVELS THROUGH <http://KIWI.COM|KIWI.COM>. Facts:- In the fall 2016 <http://KIWI.COM|KIWI.COM> changed name after 4 years as SKYPICKERS.- Both companies are leaving behind a long list of unsatisfied customers and ruined vacations.- KIWI.COMS only sells flights from various low-cost airlines, that do not coordinate their departures.- Many <http://KIWI.COM|KIWI.COM> customers complain about missing information when flights are rescheduled."
5	This is the second time I have had contact with Skypicker chat support. I was fully satisfied the first time. This time had a more complex issue to resolve.Excellent and prompt service provided by Natalya P. It took less time to resolve this than the time I had spent in phone queue to an airline!!Of course, one expects great service, it is fantastic when it works.I picked Skypicker by chance, I am now likely to book the next  trip through them!! Deserve the 5 stars!!
1	"This company is a fraud. Booked a flight with them. The dates ended up wrong. I didn't notice until 2 months after booking. I contacted them immediately. They said they didn't keep data or booking information that long. The flight doesn't leave until June. How do you not keep data into until then. So I had to pay a ""fee"" to book the proper flight that I originally had selected. The ""fee"" was basically the cost of a one way ticket to the destination. So not a fee at all but really just a new ticket. How they get away with stealing from customers this way is appalling."
1	"Be very careful when using <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> and do not trust their ""4 hour booking time."""
4	If you are looking for multi country connections then this website is for you. They have an excellent chat support with officials like Petra M who were extremely kind in updating my incorrect details and sharing the boarding passes in time. OVerall a preferred website
3	Thieving wankers
5	From finding flights that suited our travel plans and budget, thru booking, billing, electronic check in, and emailing of boarding passes I could not have asked for anything better.Highly recommend.
5	Very friendly and helpful information today!
1	They just want your money!! They will not assist you, they will jeopardize your travel! They let my mom deported going back to malaysia taking the fact that its theyre fault! jim a supervisor in kiwi told me that he will be calling me back agfter an hour and he saie he will while i already told him that after 2 hrs my mom will be deported, and i didnr receiver any call or email from him or from them, my mom was hels by indian immigration and they dont care about it!

The email that I have received when I booked the flight they say that will do que check-in online and send the document to present at chack-in balcony, did not receive the email, coud not help me with this, I had to pay extra 30€ to get the flight.Kiwi never more, ryanair the same, thanks for nothing.
1	THEY PUT HALF OF THE PRICE COMPARED TO OTHER BOOKING SITES AND I HAD TO ENTER ALL THE PERSONAL DETAILS AND MY CREDIT CARD, AND THEN WAIT A LONG TIME TO COME WITHOUT ANY RESULTS.
5	Just travelled from JFK to Copenhagen. My flight was delayed by 4 hours and I missed my connecting flight home. As soon as I contacted Kiwi a new flight was arranged same day with no extra cost. Fantastic customer service. THANKYOU KIWI!!
5	Can really recommend especially the service from Eric
5	This was my first travel abroad, and I choosen Skypicker because I found good prices for the tickets of airlines company. Above all, I gained all necessary documents to do my first travel outside Italy.
5	Aloha everyone, I want to share this experience as I did have a lot of concerns about <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>. I advise anyonewho has doubts to just reach directly to <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> and be proactive. Overall I am very satisfied with the help from Ondrej and Greame and <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> services at this stage.My long story:I am writing in regards to my windsurf trip from Sofia, Bulgaria to El Medano, Tenerife, Spain. (my flights are scheduled for February and March 2017) and at the moment of writing of this review it is the 17th of November 2016 so it has not yet found place. Intro: Sure enough a windsurfing trip is full of surprises - just imagine all the gear transferred (board, sails, masts, wetsuit...), add to it the fact that the starting point is a country in Eastern Europe and the trip at one direction would take 9-10 hours and you get the point. Moreover there are at least 2 airports in Tenerife - Tenerife South and North. As most of the big players in the industry are landing on the northern airport was left with the choice to go for a low-cost carrier. <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>: By nature I am a person who likes to prepare as much as possible and because of the negative comments on Kiwi’s Facebook page I was concerned. You see the goal of my trip is windsurfing and you can imagine all the things that can go wrong with all the gear and the low-cost, two-legged and basically independent multi-destination flights. For reassurance and more information I directly addressed <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> via Facebook as that was easiest thing for me to do. <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> Customer Service: Ondrej and Graeme from <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> answered on the minute and I threw at them literally a small list of questions and sub questions  The mini questionnaire was met with patience, a positive attitude and pretty extensive explanations. What I value most was that they were honest with me and I felt like they partially put themselves in my place. Additionally neither of them exerted any sales or marketing pressure on me which was important for me. When they were unsure of anything they did a research and made me aware of it. After all they’d been helping me on and off for around 5 hours and last but not least I was informed on the costs to transport windsurf gear via all different airlines of my interest.Final Decision: To be sure I was aware of all travel options, I also contacted directly the operating airlines and despite that chose to book via <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>, because they grasp the whole picture of my trip, their prices are very good and offered a <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> Guarantee which from my point of view is a side to turn to in case of trouble.Once done Ondrej and Greame made sure that my windsurfing status and luggage were taken care of which is pretty cool. I will be happy to post a review after I am done with my trip.Special thanks to Ondrej and Greame! Have a great week and happy customers, Andrey :)
5	We had to quickly get out passports printed out before leaving for the airport. Ondra P was extremely professional and swift with a nice personal touch. We really appreciated the service. All the best Henrik
5	"We had some questions with the e ticket which we found not straight forward. For example the covering e mail called the e ticket a ""reservation number"" which we found misleading. Katarina and Eric were VERY knowledgeable, helpful and friendly."
1	They do not stand by any guarantee.  They will not honor it no matter what.  There is nothing you can't book for cheaper than them directly with the airline.  If you expect them to stand by the booking if things change don't.
5	Ms. Sophiya Gerasimiva, thank you very much for your kind help in arranging the add-ons for my families first ever international flight. I cant wait for them to tell me about their experience for the first time. I appreciate your time you gave. I didnt think you would reply on weekends but i am absolutely happy to see you got in touch all over the weekend. Thank you again.Samir (email of daniel j)
4	Had a great customer service experience. Both representatives I have chatted with, Suzana and Vendula, have been excellent.Thank you ladies for you help.
5	Whatever the problem is, the staff of skypicker is always available to resolve it as sooner as possible giving any client a careful attention.
5	Had done 4 reservations already through Skypicker with flight connections and several air companies and all was taken care perfectly, received even Boarding tickets already filled.
1	Very awful expérience . We bought our flights for the first time with this company and WILL NEVER BUY AGAIN!!!!!! never Had problems with others like for example skyscanner or kayak.  We Had confirmation number and the next day we receive email informing us that our ticket price Just went up 300$ and that if we wanted to keep our flight we Had to pay the difference ! !!! When I called client services and spoke to Allan  Whitefield,  he sais that it is out of their control .The prices always changes even every 10 minutes said the team supervisor  Anaf Dalal . SO HOW RELIABLE IS THIS ???? They sais that they cant keep up with the price changes and the updates of their prices on the site. According to Consumer protection law  how could this be LEGAL.!!!! We spoke the next day and THE PRICES WE ORIGINALLY PAID WAS STILL ON THE SITE!!!!! even 24H hours later. Dont trust the prices on this site...EVER
5	iam very very satisfied with Mr. Alex A and friend to resolved my problem, very professional and very fast respond, and i will make <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> be my partner traveling.
5	When I first saw the Skypicker price on Kayak, I was thrilled. I had not heard of it yet, but I googled them and discovered they are a new business model that has been extremely successful at finding cheap flights online. It worked perfectly, even for a discount airline going to Myanmar, (which felt about as remote of a travel experience as I could have). Consider Skypicker in the future!
5	Ottimo tutto, oltre ad aver acquistato il biglietto ad un prezzo molto conveniete, non ho avuto nessun problema per ottenere la carta d'imbarco e tutte le informazioni. Veramente veloce ed utile il supporto via chat. Jolana D. l'operatrice è stata gentilissima e mi ha dato il supporto richiesto. Lo consiglio a tutti.
5	I needed to urgently change my flight and I was very pleasantly surprised with how easy and quick it was! Olena and Rita were really helpful and quick to help me! Definitely using Kiwi to book my flights in the future!Natalie*A very happy customer
5	Natalia was super-helpful in all my questions for my booking !! Thank you so much !!
3	Skypicker.. .curious what it is? check here - <https://t.co/eW31IB43l5>
3	@travelsofadam What are your thoughts on discount flight finders like Skypicker? <https://t.co/KE0smolWul>
4	I haven't actually flown yet, but I booked a flight and made a mistake with my email address. It was very simple to open up a chat window with a rep (LEO), identify the mistake, and get it corrected. Thanks a bunch Leo for a relatively pleasant experience with a relatively stressful situation!
5	I was booking flight with two different airlines, with two stops for some friends who do not speak english. This was no problem. I opened <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com>, opened a chat and Denis and Tamar at live-chat, gave me all the help and answers to all my questions. I gave them the passport details, and then got confirmation on online check in. I feel really safe to use <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> at any time to book my flights !
5	Many thanks; the services you provide are excellent. The answers to queries were quick and informative. Certainly will choose Kiwi for next trips.
5	Quickly managed to get support on changes in my itinerary and stuff like adding additional luggage; friendly staff (Leo).
5	Very quick response, even when mistakes were made from customers side. Always ready for a quick solution. Great service by Edoardo P..
5	I felt so well taken care of, and it was so fast, if it werent for this brilliant galls I would have lost my flights. Thank you girls so much
5	I found skypicker quite by accident and found them to be very reasonable, booking flights during school summer is very expensive.  The customer service was excellent.  If I had an email querie, I had a response very quickly.  Your team are extremely polite and helpful.  Will definitely use you again and have recommended you to friends.
5	Got great help from Juan Costa! Saving our holiday
5	I have used many other flight comparison sites, but none come close to Skypicker. I will be deleting some of the other apps after this experience. Fast, simple and clear, the only site to find the flight I booked!
5	Very well and clear explanation to all my questions done by Ivana V. Thakyou so much Ivana for your support.
5	Very good service
4	The airplane windows were pretty dirty but that was the only nuisance during my trip.
5	Hi there,thanks for getting me to final destination. I had reservation with Skypicker and stuck on one airport while my flight had been delayed and I missed connection. Skypicker found me another flight and completely refund hotel room and new ticket. The service Skypicker Guarantee is awesome and I will check Skypicker soon for another cheap flights.Also customer service was amazing, they replied in a second and especialy Oliver was very helpful.Thank you again for great jobJiri
5	The service man was super helpful.He (Simon) understood my problem right away, solved it even if it took him some extra time.I fully recommend Kiwi and I will book again :)
5	I bought my tickets to travel home from a further destination (3 connecting flights) but unfortunately I forgot to add my additional luggage to the ticket and I did not realize it just until a week before flight. Thanks to the live chat option Michal was able to help me as far as making me comfortable that he will do his best to make it happen (as it turned out some of my airlines actually does not allow extra luggage). Later I received and e-mail with all the information and the link where I could purchase the extra bag, and I would like to sincerely thank to: Michal, Eleonora, Puput and Martin for making my journey home stress-free and doing it within such a short time. The whole process took approximately a day, and I was updated every step on the way, amazing team , thank you once again!Best,Kitti Safranek
3	Is the first time that I book with this company because of the good prices but won't do it again. I've never received an email with the confirmation or the information of my flights. I had to be calling all the time. Also even my flights were from Ryanair and they accept the Chek in until 4 hours before the flight, with this company must be 72 hours before, otherwise you must pay 140€ per passenger!! That's crazy!! the service they provide for the check in is helpless. Also I cannot manage my flight I cannot choose anything. However, the worker Bartlomiej Kmietek was very kind and very helpful, he could make our check in 24 hours before our flights. He had been very quick on his emails and given us solutions. I'm very grateful to him.
5	Lukas was extremely swift and helpful during my customer service chat. Looking forward to my flight!
5	Question concerned option of adding checked baggage to a 2-leg flight with only 2 hours layover scheduled and 2nd departure in different terminal at Barcelona with different airline. Katerina Entlerova was sensible, honest - not promising what Kiwi couldn't guarantee - and did her best to help. My conclusion: not worth risk (and cost) of checking a bag.
4	A good site with very helpful staff who are ready to help you with your problems. Tamara helped me quickly and efficiently to resolve my issue with check-in.
5	Thank you for all the helped i get to all this people. DAVID, NINA, YURI, JONATHAN and PETRA.

5	comunicato ora via chat,risolto il problema che avevo di prenotazione nonostante il mio inglese pessimo mi hanno capito.quoto l'operatricie lucie.
5	I had to figure out whether I should change my flight or cancel it due to a personal situation, and I spoke with customer service rep Bogdan from the Czech Republic and he was patient, helpful, and easy to understand.
5	Efficient and awesome is how I'd describe my customer experience with Teona. She got back to me swiftly with exactly the information I needed, despite that information being bad news (i.e. each connecting flight/airline charges individually for extra checked-in baggage :( which can become quite expensive depending on your connections. PLEASE ADD THIS TO YOUR HELP SECTION). But that's not her fault and she was very gracious and caring and just overall GREAT. Give this woman a raise and a hug! She rocks!
1	There is my very bad experience with KiwiI bought the flight Chisinau-Moscow-Guandzou and back. Bought ONE ticket on the whole way. It was 100$ more expensive then I can buy two separate tickets myself but I need ONE as I'm going to fly with pet. If I would have two tickets I would pay pet fee for each ticket Kiwi sent me TWO tickets in realSo as a result I payed 100$ extra on ticket plus 75 euro extra for one segment as a et feeWhen I asked for immidiate compensation Kiwi refusedThey are just cheaters earning money but not doing the dealWill never work with them again
4	e-chat is efficient.booking is fast

1	My husband and I recently booked with Kiwi for a flight from Guangzhou, China to Montreal, Canada. We had one domestic connecting flight. When we arrived to our first destination, we were advised that the flight had been changed from 6PM scheduled to 3PM starting January 1st, 2017. We were flying on January 6th and had not been advised either by Kiwi or the airline we'd booked with. As it turned out, no one at the airport in Qingdao had ever heard of the airline Kiwi had booked us with (Japan Air Systems). During the entire rebooking experience, <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> was completely out of it's league in dealing with routine changes and international travel communication. No one at the Qingdao airport available to help us or the <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> staff was either able to speak English or call overseas. This is a rather common situation with flights connecting in smaller Chinese cities, a reality that a company like <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>, that's very business model is based on taking advantage of connecting flights should no doubt take into consider. Not the case! Thankfully we are able to do both and coordinated OUR OWN flights out of China. <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> was offering us $800 each to fly from Qingdao to Montreal, a flight that cost over $1500 each. We would have to pay upfront an amount higher than our ORIGINAL booking in order only to get to our NEXT CONNECTION (not yet to our final destination) and then miss our last flight to our final destination. In addition to that, <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> was still, after repeated phone calls, no able to produce a reason for the lack of communication regarding with the flight changes, no apology, no rebooking, no information, no Chinese speaker to deal with the international flight coordinators in China and completely incompetent and incoherent staff who are unable to work under pressure. The only flight out of Qingdao bound for Canada was either in 3 hours or in 3 days. We obviously wanted to get on the flight in 3 hours because <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> was also not providing any coverage for hotel costs and so as not to miss our connecting flight and start the whole fiasco over again. Advised of the urgency of our situation, all of the several phone operators we got in contact with froze under pressure.In addition to all this, <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>'s site is not accessible in China without VPN, probably because it uses Google maps. In an airport on wifi, there is no way to connect to their site. Staff at smaller Chinese airports are also not equipped to call overseas. Several major international phone carriers also do not work in China. Neither do the payphones call overseas.Please be advised. If you are not fluent in Chinese, DO NOT ATTEMPT TO FLY <http://KIWI.COM|KIWI.COM> THROUGH CHINA. You may spend a lot longer time there than you wish. I personally rate my experience as completely unacceptable and am not prepared to recommend booking with <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>.
5	Very quick answers, positive attitude and availability
5	Yeah, I'm another happy customer that ALEX .A dealt with. The website does not give the option to book luggage 1 way- so I had to book it after I booked my flights separately.... Very disappointed with the huge costs to do this, but the customer service I received was excellent, very happy and will use sky picker again Thank you Alex.A xx
1	Tengo un problema con el check in de mi vuelo para mañana desde Budapest hasta Las Palmas de Gran Canaria. A pesar de que desde la pagina en el FAQ dicen que pueden solucionarlo mandando un mensaje, no he recibido respuesta en todo el dia. Me han tenido 15 minutos de espera en el telefono (cobrandome una llamada internacional) y no he obtenido respuesta. En el chat, que supuestamente es para solucionar preguntas y problemas, no hay nafie al otro lado, tras horas y horas de intentos nadie se pone en contacto conmigo. Un desastre inaceptable
5	Thank you for providing the quick service for making the change to my passenger info.  Customer service was a pleasure to work with.

5	With this Service i got Managed, what was looking not to manage for me! Thanks a los!
5	Ms. Maria kudos to you. She did a great job in helping me on my queries. A friendly customer service. I so happy to be assisted by her. Thanks a lot.
3	@skypickercom so only 2400 out of pocket ..... I stand corrected
5	Great and fast! :-) I would only have to deal with such advisers as Tamara great that in two minutes helped me solve a problem. thank you very much and recommend it! I greet Greg
5	My friend and I traveled all over Vietnam and used Skypicker to book all of our flights during our journey.  We were hoping that everything was good upon checking in at the airport.  We had absolutely no hiccups during our travels.  Thank you skypicker for making our trip go off without any airport nightmares.xx
5	First it was Anna that helped me with my ticket booking. She helped me understand the process, how 24hrs grace period applies even to the tickets booked on kiwi and what different messages on website mean while booking. She was thorough and contacted airlines first before giving me a response and stayed on chatline till i booked my tickets.Then, Milica helped me with cancelling my ticket. She was patient and thorough in explaining the process to me and she stayed on the chat for as long as she didnt hear from the airlines. Amazing commitment and service, quite impressive!
5	Michal and jakub good job guys! Keep it up with the performance. They answer all my question perfectly. Lifting away half of my worries from trusting <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com>. Thankyou!
5	thank you for taking such good care... Booking, payment, check-in: everything flawless and no action required from us except laying back, drive to airport and fly ;)
5	"I used <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> many times. They had a great online chat service. If you have problem you can reach them easily by cheating. Last time ""Jan""  helped me. It fast and clear. He/she solved the problem fast. Thanks."
5	Elsa c, saved my a lot of stress when I was booking while traveling by helping me find information needed I did not have on hand. I was skeptical abt kiwi at first but now very satisfied.
5	agents here are professional, they aswered my queries as fast as they can, and with good attitude in  rendering their services. especially to mr. bogdan he really helped me a lot. thank you so much.Godbless!!!
5	I had problema with my travel but they knew support me, I recommend it, excellent service and prices very good,
5	First time using this website as it was directed from <http://kayak.com|kayak.com> but was impressed by the service. I have tried to book the ticket originally from the airline website (Air Asia) itself but it has so many process to go through and so many items to cancel as there are a lot of additional charges add on but once I processed to the payment page,  the system fails. Therefore I decided to book from <http://skypicker.com|skypicker.com>. It was so much convenient and hassle free. What you need to do during booking are just providing the name and date of birth and then made the payment. This save your time as you do not have to go through 5 or 6 process if you book from the original website. After the booking was made, I used the live chat to do the add ons and check in. The adviser , Sophia has helped me to solve all my problem. I just have to let her know which meal do i prefer and once she sent me the link for payment everything was sorted. She even help me to check the seats and manage to change the seats for me. I am very impressed with the service and very satisfied that immediate action were taken and my requirements was met without going through all the complex process and the most important thing is the cost was the same as the original airline website. With the same cost that you would have to pay, why not try <http://skypicker.com|skypicker.com> with a better service provided and save you a lot of time going through all the booking process. Massive thank you for Sophia and <http://skypicker.com|skypicker.com>.
4	We're extremely excited to announce our partnership with @skypickercom <https://t.co/GaWy3Q60pX> #PR
1	after making changes to booking, name corrections, Skypicker gave me notice to re-buy part of my trip from Qantas Air. Short notice forced me to do so. At the airport Qantas officer informed me that it was wrong to re-buy a ticket, as small fee would do the trick. After returning home, I contacted Qantas on their complaint line, whom said the same thing, and also informed me that Skypicker did not purchase my ticket, but rather some company from India. Contacting Skypicker for a refund, they cleaned their hands, and refused to pay me back for their erro. Rip off artist. Never deal with these people again, and I am gong to pursue further action.
5	Spoke to Natali, very efficient in adding extra baggage for my 4 flights. Also, went further and checked each airline for any change in prices. Great help and company!
5	My chat request was immediately answered by Miroslava P.... and she solved the problem within a couple of minutes. Very well done,  thanks Mirka
1	I was taken advantage by this company. Bought plane tickets and got confirmation email. Then a day later they send an email telling me the prices increase and that i have to pay MORE to hold those tickets. What's the point of buying it online if the prices you pay online isn't accurate. I felt taken advantage of because I already booked my hotels. The other big travel companies: expedia, travelocity, orbitz would NEVER pull anything like this. BEWARE & STAY AWAY.
5	The assistance from Ajit was very quick and precize with a nice and friendly tone :) Thank you Ajit, looking forward to book again on <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> :)Emanuel
4	Very courteous and helpful customer support.
5	I've been in touch with Kiwi's customer service twice in regards to my booking. Most currently I spoke to Aura. Many thanks to her for solving my issue fast and efficiently! First time I spoke to Tamara, whom also helped me with what I needed very swiftly. Excellent customer service!
5	Thank you so much Anna, you solved the issue sooner and you have been so kind.Thank youCamilla

5	Excellent service today from Yana Kravchuk - my query concerning hand luggage on a booked flight was answered so promptly and explained so well!  Thank you!
5	The attention was really great... polite, fast and to the point.Eleonora C. solved my problem in 2 minutes!
4	I booked three times...all unsuccessfull. How will i book a ticket completely and successfully without telling me..'sorry we have technical issues'..what should i do?
4	I wrote down wrongly my email address so I didn't receive my booking confirmation. I haven't noticed this until Kira K. has called me this morning and has been more than helpful correcting it.
5	The best I have ever received by any travel service. I have used many services over 20 years of travel. My online agents Martina & Tomas was tremendous in helping me sort out travels.
5	Many thanks to skypicker for the extreme kindness to a little problem that I encountered.The online operator Ivana was very friendly and immediately ready to solve my problem, with a huge kindness and professionalism. The service was perfect!Thanks again!!!
5	I called Kiwi to increase my luggage allowance. I got through to Jan who was super helpful and friendly. Despite the airline in question having technical difficulties, he managed to get the information I needed, offering me a call back rather than leaving me on hold and then swiftly sent through a link for me to make payment. Problem solved! Very swift and efficient service, and always good to speak to someone so charming and friendly :DThank you Jan!
5	Lilia K. supported me via chat. I had a very specific question concerning my dual citizenship and traveling with two passports, but she tried her best to help me out and always responed quickly.I know dual citizenship issues are not the normal kind of costumers issues and therefore she also wasnt 100% sure, but I understand.Overall i am satisfied!
5	Called to ask about my booking, unlike other travel agencies I didn't have to wait long on the phone before a very friendly, knowledgeable and professional agent by the name of Vika took my call, she was able to guide me through the E-ticket and insure that all my queries were answered.I am surprise that not a lot of people are not aware of this great service company..
5	Who wants to travel across America or international , I suggest to try this service .Good prices and routes , amazing service , customer support 24/7 RECOMMEND
5	I needed help to change my booking.  Dániel Péter was very helpful and didn't stop the conversation before he was sure that everything was fine. Thanks Dániel.
4	Thank you Natalia V., Monika F for helping me with the mis-spelt suraname. It was great and I could travel without being worried that something should go wrong!
1	i have tried to book a flight on 16 april but the booking got cancelled. I automatically received a email for me choose how will i get refunded and i choose the be refunded the same way i payed, via my credit card. It was stated that i will receive my money back at the maximum if 10 working days but till this day i didn't receive anything while my account of the site stated that my flight got refunded.i sent their support an email and I am waiting for a reply
4	Good service till now! I had a problem with a schedule change but it was very easy to resolve it through the chat, thanks to Irina!
4	Get 10 EUR off your first booking with Skypicker, the startup that’s disrupting the OTA industry! #travel <https://t.co/r14siSKFGG>
5	So happy and thankful for the service provided by handler Nizar at <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> regarding the reservation my little brother misunderstood. Kind, helpful and professional help, Thank you once again!Best regards, Linn, Sweden
5	I have booked my flight to Glasgow via London from Istanbul via <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com>. Overall it was a decent experience and I had no issues with the reservation. Online check-in made it easy to handle the process at the airport, leaving more time for wandering the stores at the airport.
5	I've used kiwi many times this year, using it already when it was still called skypicker. I'm a huge fan of their service and can recommend it to the fullest. As I'm travelling almost exclusively in Asia, I can just recommend for booking flights there. Has almost always been the cheapest option (plus their wonderful online check in service). Good work, keep it going.
5	Eric was able to answer my questions and ease my mind in just a few short minutes. Excellent rep!
4	After having trouble with Ryanair I spoke to Lukas on the online chat who was very helpful and efficient with finding a solution for me.
5	Smooth web interface, great staff and responsive chat feature. Special thanks to Lili and Yana for their prompt help!
3	@skypickercom Dear Skypicker, when am I getting my refund? It has passed 10 days mark now. Ref: 499047. Amount: 2857 ZAR
4	Skypicker from Madrid wants to recruit me as a data scientist, pitching in 5 digits of salary... in... Euros... #merrychristmas?????
5	Had a very good experience.  They helped me with some changes I need without any stress. Will definitely book with them again
5	I found very good prices for a difficult journey - 4 flights! - and I made a mistake with two flights.Was not an easy replace becouse I was using three different companies. The customer support followed and helped me first with live chat after with mail - senior cs manager - and they managed to save one of the two flight.Instead of doing like other companies, Skypicker CS team didn't stop keeping the contacts until the problem was resolved in the best way.So maximum rate: really find best prices and combination and great Customer Support. I am already looking from my next flights!
4	It took some time (around 30 mins), but in the end, everything went fine.Filip was polite. Asked some details twice if necessary.I would highly recommend <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> to my friends and relatives.Good job, Kiwi !
5	Silly me i lost my flight details and the live chat was very helpful in relaxing me and helping me. I'm very thankful
1	They generate flights with more them one PNRs making the policy in between flights different. PAY ATTENTION on that before you buy if them and if you can do NOT use their services. Its not worth it.The worst place to buy flight tickets !! If you are reading this information never use this website to book flights. They sell you cheap flights but the policies and what you get its not worth it. Go in the airline website and buy your flights straight with the airline or do a better research online. I bought my flights with <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> and 1st time I used but I will never use it anymore !! To reach the customer service is rubbish...they say they will help you but, after loads of blablabal they and reading policies they do not do anything to help ! Thx <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> for selling me the the worst cheap flights of my life !
5	I called the customer service for my boarding pass. The guy (named Henry according to himself) was really nice. He explained to me that there was a minor technical issue and that he would resolve it for me shortly. Then he apologized for the inconvenience. He was very nice from the beginning to the end. I would suggest his boss to give him a beer for this. I would rate the customer service five star.
5	I mistakenly made a change on my booking, so I contacted the open live chat and the operator Viktor fixed everything. He has been very kind.
5	Un ringraziamento a Francesco che stamattina in modo celere, con tanta gentilezza ha subito risolto un piccolo errore verificatosi in fase di acquisto...Grazie ancora
5	This was the first time I used Skypicker and I was extremely happy with their services. Thanks to Skypicker I found great flight connections at very reasonable price. Their customer service was very helpful and fast. I will definitely be using Skypicker again for my next trip.
5	I booked a very last minute weekend trip to Poland and the prices I found on Skypicker were by far the best around (having searched around ten other websites).  I found the website extremely easy to navigate and the booking process was very simple (which was needed as I am not a frequent flyer!).  I received all of my documents within minutes of the booking confirmation with no glitches at all, making my journey enjoyable and stress free.  I am already planning my next trip!
5	Very simple way to book several flights, helpdesk works quickly and efficiently, I am very happy with Kiwi, and will definitely use them again.
1	I purchased a flight for the value of 562 euro. I was reluctant because there was a chance I could not make the flight.So I purchased full cancellation insurance 38.86 euro. Total costs 600.86As I feared I could not commit to the flight, and was forced to cancel 1 week prior to departure.Kiwi commenting saying my MAX refund would be 145 euro, AND they would subtraact 20 euro handling fee!!!!Why the hell have insurance on your ticket then!!!IF you buy from Kiwi,, make sure you are 200% sure of everything! because you'll get didlesquat back if you end up in a pinch!
5	I'm really impressed with the quality of service so far, it was very easy to use the website and the flights were a great price.  Confirmation has been received and we have our eticket.
5	I must thank my travel consultant Dmitriy, he was very helpfull during the process. I was a little bit lost on the website and stressed out because it was less than 70 something hours before my flight. I did not fill in all details about my passport and date of expiration. He helped me with online check-in, what was very pleasant for me, because I do not fly that much often.
5	I was having difficulty booking online for my boarding pass.  I phoned <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> and spoke to Simon who was extremely helpful.  Within 5 minutes I had my boarding pass emailed to me.
4	I did a booking with Spirit airlines through <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com>. It was my mistake that I booked a flight for one date and it supposed to be for another date. So, when I observe my mistake I called to <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> for alternatives. First Spirit will not refund me anything because according to their policy the just do it if the booking have not pass 7 days. In my case I bought the ticket 5 days before. The other alternative was change my flight for Jan 24 at the same hour I did my booked but prices was higher and there was not the same flight hour. I know that some people working there offered me alternatives but sometimes I don't understand well because my first language is not english. It was hard. (For me and for them I know) I was trying to find a cheaper flight because I'm student and I'm traveling to different states for interviews. So I try to saved some money for my trip. Fortunately I found other flight directly with Spirit very economic but I was wondering if maybe at least they can saved me the money of my luggage. Thanks to Theodor (an employee of kiwi) that was possible. He was very kind and very patient. He talked with Spirit and at least I saved that. So in general maybe I did not save all but I save something :D
4	Everything went wrong with our trip that was booked through kiwi. The flight was late, we missed our other flight ect. Kiwi rebooked us on the next available flight, and since it was the next morning, they  compensated us for the sleeping costs. The only reason they're not getting 5 stars, is that I couldn't call them for some reason. They show excellent service and proved to us that they can be trusted
5	very good company
1	I have booked hundreds of airline flights with multiple airlines, booking agencies, and online services. This is the first one I have dealt with that charges a $23 fee to cancel a booking in under 24 hours of making the reservation. I highly recommend against anyone using this website to book a ticket, go directly with the airline or another online agency that won't try to screw you over if you have to change your flight within 24 hours of booking. Avoid this booking agency.
5	First time I buy through Kiwi and I am completely satisfied as it offered me a ready check in on three different flights for which i was just notified by email within the 24 hours before travel. No effort from me, just needed the wifi connection to get the emails from kiwi. Easy, loved it.
5	Got help from Andii and Natali and they are both great. They give good options too! Kiwi website itself is simple and the policies are straightforward.
5	I'm very pride of leonardo him is amazing worker bless you leonardo thanks for you help I HOPE thats helps a lot people in your job
1	I sent to skypicker to change the date of my booked flight then they sent the change price to be paid. After they confirmed receiving the payment, they sent the new confirmed ticket date.I went to check in at the airport and I did not find a ticket on the system. I called skypicker to either provide the ticket number or do the reservation for the ticket, they confirmed that the reservation was done before but they don't have the ticket number!!!I asked them again to reserve the ticket before the ticketing is closed but they did not.After an hour, they called my to confirm that there is no ticket for me and it is their fault so they can book a flight in the next day however I asked for a flight on the same day because I have an urgent personal situation,  they said we will check the alternatives and come back to you.They stared wasting time and I kept calling them and informing them about the flights available for that date, but they start telling me it is not approved by the manager because it is expensive and the only option available is to wait for tomorrow flight.I'm still waiting at the airport to receive a call from them.!!!!!!
5	I got another baggage checked in within 48h before the departure, it was because I booked the ticket within 24h before the flight. Also, There was no options on the website where I can add another baggage, they solved the problem and made it possible within several hours.
5	Martin Carter you are awsome, thanks for your help :) we already got the boarding info by e-mail very fast Service.This review is made on behalf of Fanny Koskinen.
5	I just got an excellent service from Pavel Fridrich.Thanks for calling me and making sure I understood everything, you are very kind!! :)
4	Thank you Owen Wilson for taking the time out in helping me rectify my flight problems.  I look forward in hearing from you.
5	I have been in communication with Juan Costa, from the 24/7 telephone support line: he helped me get my boarding passes in a really fast and professional manner! Thanks!
5	I came across this website today while booking air tickets for my upcoming trip to Vietnam. I was pleasantly surprised to find the fares being lowest by a healthy margin compared to other websites. However, the delighter for me was my customer service experience when trying to cancel an erroneously booked ticket. I entered incorrect date for one leg of my journey and realized my mistake within minutes of making the payment. I called the customer care number not really expecting much help. But Theresa (who had a very reassuring voice) explained me that since the booking is still under processing she will try to get it cancelled (although she did manage my expectation by preparing me for a possible disappointment). 10 minutes later I got a cancellation confirmation email giving me various methods to claim refund. I chose <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> credit in a heartbeat because I see myself using this website again. Keep doing the good work.

1	"Here's what it comes down toUse <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> if.....You have a simple flight to do with no checked baggage.Don't use <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> if...You have checked baggage, or need their customer support for anything. They wont fix your problem, they wont try and make you feel better about the company. They will argue they are right and you are wrong, BUT later when you prove them wrong, they wont still fix your problem, they will only ever offer you numerous "" sorry"" comments.I should have taken seriously all their bad reviews, I thought I wont have a bad experience..well I was wrong, this was my first and last time using Kiwi.com...useless Czech company.Watch, even after this review, I will see a rep from <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> reply saying sorry for your problem, and yada yada yada, but wont fix my problem."

5	We had a lot of difficulty booking via Viva Colombia airline while travelling - it may be because we were not in Colombia at the time or had a UK card. Kiwi made it possible to book these flights and just on our phones. No problems.
5	Online Customer Service are very good, they answered a few questions I had very professionally.Emails come in on every update.
5	Thanks to Eric !!!About a doubt about our booking after payment on the website, I got Eric on the phone initially only known as being available in English speaking only who immediately proposed to switch to French !My original request was about the potential missing email confirmation but reviewing the data, he found out an key entering error on one of our names ! He immidiately manage this with the company given the fact that our flight was in 2 days. All our exchange has been very cordial and friendly. I felt really better after my call with Eric. Thanks a lot ,   Laurent

5	excellent Assistance and patience in resolving the issue successfully.
5	i made a mistake with my personal data. The live chat of Skypicker correct the data very fast. thank goes to Yulia Krasenko

1	So I purchased some flights for my mother to fly from Manchester to Tangier with stop of in Barcelona when my mother arrived at Manchester she was told she was not booked on to the flight so she then paid with cash for her flight to Barcelona while I purchased her flight from Barcelona To Tangier buy card and then after she got back I contacted the company for a refund and they are saying I need to show them proof I booked different flights at airport why should I have to show them proof? In end of day they did not book my flights and I should get a refund I should not have to show evidence I booked another flight terrible service customer service just as bad don't recommend to anyone anyway bank is dealing with it now But if you can try and ABVOID this company just incase same happens to you

5	I've used Skypicker a few times now to do multi-leg one-way tickets across the globe. The prices are nearly always lower than competing sites like Skyscanner or Kayak, and I like that I can see the fares for an entire month at a glance.
5	I have never seen such a customer service. Michal and Tamara solved me a major problem. I had forgotten (ill last week) to book on-line for two flights and I had to pay extra charge. They assisted me in the best possible way.Clear instructions, immediate actions, polite and substantially effective!Congratulations to the company and its employees. I will use every time from now on kiwi.(Note: I am involved in research, so ok I am not an easy going person congratulating everyone. There has been a reason!)
5	Jan is the absolute best!! I stared off quite upset and honestly maybe a little rude but Jan just stuck with me. Spent the whole time working to problem at hand and assuring me that she would figure this out, and of course she did. Couldn't have asked for better customer service and end result to the problem at hand. Thanks again Jan!!!

5	Hello!I have been in contact with Thomas Music and Juan Costa, from call center support, regarding a flight issue i had these days: a flight operated by Ryanair has been delayed more than 10 hours and that caused me losing two connection flights. Both guys were very helpful and offered the support and information necessary to solve my issue in the best possible way! Great service and support!
5	I dealt with Martin Carter at Skypicker.  Nothing was too much for him and he went the extra mile.
5	Had some trouble with my boarding pass and got assistance from Eva. Just wanted to say thanks again, very helpful!
4	I got a problem (wrong birthday info) and I realized just 8 hours before my flight so the chances were either get it fix for free, get a charge fee or worst case scenery lost the flight because of that small number but fortunately the person from <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> ¨ERIK¨ was just the perfect guy to help me, he was patience, clear and quick just in a matter of 30 min my problem was fixed, so THANKS A LOT ERIK AND <http://KIWI.COM|KIWI.COM>.
5	The second chat with Alan Withfield and like the first time I got more help and ambition, I ever expected. He answered my questions with patience and tried everything possible to help me (even with the limitations ofbthe company). I need to cancel a flight and he tries to take care of it. I hope he will make it. Thx a lot..... too bad that kiwi seems to have no flight cancellation insurane... that would make it easier with my 5 multistop flights
5	Lukas is best of the best agent. understanding my problem and quickly decided it. Thank you!
5	Customer service is great, really solved my problem.
5	I needed to change my dates for flight but I wrongly made request for different destination. I could not solve this problem till I contacted openchat with manager Johnatan, he was very helpful and resolved my issue very fast. Good service
1	"Had to go through this experience with a friend who was traveling to Columbia from Sweden. He bought the ticket from Skypicker via a transit flight in the US.At the airport he was not allowed entry to the States because he did not have a transit visa and there were two different air companies so he would need to check out in the States and get a transit visa. The whole ticket got invalidated and calling up Skypicker we were specifically told they would find a new route but also possibly look through if they could help us with compensation. I was specifically told to tell my friend ""everything will be ok"".We ended up waiting 6 hours at the airport for them to call back and give us an answer but the only thing we were told by the end of the day were that the coming next days of flights would be very expensive. I was promised another call the next day with a reply of them the following day telling us that they would not compensate him in any way, with the exception of a possible tax refund. What made it even worse for him was he is not a Swedish citizen and did not have the money to buy a new ticket.I was present during the purchase of the ticket and I did not see a specific informative prerequisite that said ticket is invalid unless you have the transit visa in the States so that's where my disappointment lies. It was written in the email confirmation but that's also after the purchase and not before. I asked that as a travel agency there should be some clarification about what's required if you buy tickets from them.Also the fact that having to wait at the airport for 6 hours for a phone call and possibly making about 10 ones myself just to keep up the contact only to be told that they will not help us in way except for finding a new route within a week.20 hours later we have pretty much ran out of options and he's just had a really bad nightmare, mildly speaking."
2	I thought the online check in was great and what probably saved me from something that should not have happened. I booked through skypicker from Coolangatta to Phuket with a short stop over in Kuala Lumpur. All my friends had booked through the air line and they all had connecting flights. Me? I had to go through immigration, baggage reclaim, security check points to get out and then back in to check in my luggage, immigration, security check points in a busy airport I am not familiar with and do it all in just 50 minutes.  check in closed before I could put my bag in but I managed to get the bag on the plane and I just made it to the gate to board just in time. Not happy with the experience and will never go through sky picker again to avoid this.
5	I was really satisfied by the actions taken by agent Jakub P. regarding adding luggage to my reservation and helping me with the check-in even if I missed the 48-hour period before the flight expired around an hour before I started taking actions. He was very helpful and was willing to help me in the best way possible with the situation that I occurred! That is why I rate his support with the maximum score!
5	I am always booking flights with <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com>, formerly known as skypicker. Always satisfied with the results, best value, no additional costs! Also one of the best customer service I ever experienced, friendly and competent service team, they'll do everything to help you, big Thank You to Aurelija!
5	Missed a flight due to delay, customer support was immediatly contactable and booked an alternative flight for us, no extra cost. Thumbs up.
5	We had a problem with a check in online and lost a bit hope that its still possible to do something with it. But I must say live chat works perfectly and these 5 stars are for Alan who helped us quickly.Alan, you are a professional and you made our eve! Thank you one more time!
5	Radim was excellent sorted and answered all my questions. Thanks!
5	we used the chat service. it was fast and very helpful. they were very patient and professional. thank you Renata!
1	Yesterday afternoon you've informed me that my booking was prevented by an airline price change. I certainly can understand that ticket prices change rapidly, but the unfair commercial practice (ref: Unfair Commercial Practices Directive) is when you've already charged my card for an amount  you've advertised and then after few hours informed me that the price changed and is now higher. If you have such poor synchronisation with airline service, you can only reserve the amount on my card and in no case can you charge for something you're not able to guarantee at the price you advertise.I was even more appalled by your unfair and misleading practice when I later in the evening checked online that you continue to advertise ticket prices at a change but still lower rate, which is still at a lower rate than the rate you wanted to charge me, so even though according to your information that the tickets at lower price were no longer available, you advertised it anyway.Extreamly disapointed, will not recommend <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> to anyone.Aly
5	for an excellent assistance provided by Emre T. !!!
1	I used this company to source a competitive price for a same day return flight from Birmingham to Glasgow. The price that came back through their website appeared to be a fair price, so I continued with the online booking process. I was asked to provide my credit/debit card details as part of the process and the page in question was explicit in saying that no charge would be made against the card until final confirmation on price had been supplied i,e, further in the process. I completed all required elements of the online form against the original price quoted. I had an email from Kiwi confirming receipt of payment. Thirty minutes later, I received a second email, advising of a minor delay in completing the ticket issue. I then received a third email just under two hours after the notification of a minor delay to tell me that they could not proceed with the booking at the quoted price, due to the flight carrier changing prices during the process. As part of the email, I was given the two options, one was to carry on with the revised price or the second one was to offer me a refund. I clicked on the second option as I could get the flight cheaper by going direct to the carrier (FlyBe in this case). As part of the process in requesting a full refund was a statement from Kiwi that reimbursement of the funds would take no longer than 10 days. Here I am, now 47 days after the event, and despite calls into the Czech republic call centre, and progressing this through my bank, I am still owed £214 by this company.....Looks like the next step will be through the courts!!

5	Great customer service from Dorota! Thank you! :)
1	Been trying to contact @skypickercom for the last hour to no avail. No check in email received so will be charged a fee I can't afford :(
4	"I alaways had a dream-to travell around the world.But  I live in Ukraine and my salary doesn't allow me to buy tickets and to go just whenever I want.Two months ago my Dad sent me a message with the link he found in one of the networks -skypicker link. He wrote me""This is your key to the world"". I saw tickets price and decided to try such opportunity.I have bought tickets from Warsaw to Paris only for 20$.It was the best birthday ever.I celebrated it on the Eiffel Tower,Elysian Fields.I saw everything I wanted to see in Paris.Thank you,Skypicker,for this present. Now I have more dreams and I hope them to come true:)"
1	The worst experience ever with Skypicker. My flight was cancelled at last minute and they did not offer an alternative flight same day. They offered flying 3 days later but they could not change my return dates meaning my holidays to be cut from 7 to 3 days, as I did not accept this for obvious reasons they only refunded half of the ticket when the airline was willing to refund the whole ticket. Basically, if I would have booked with the airline directly I would have got my full refund.They argued my return ticket was not affected and of course it was , I could not going to have only 3 days of holidays when I booked one week off. I made a single booking under one booking reference and they ended up splitting it up at their convenience.Never ever again with Skypicker.Agents are square minded, my case was missmanaged.
1	Go to more known and trusted sites to book your flights! I've been traveling the globe for ten consecutive years non-stop booking on average 6-8 international flights a year and this was the worst!! It took 5 hours to get confirmation of my booking. When I realized it was three flights and each was charging a separate baggage fee (I have never had to pay for checked luggage on an international flight and neither should anyone else out there.) I promptly tried calling the company to cancel, but it was past business hours. Called the next day and was told I could only cancel within two hours of the booking. Horrible customer service and nobody spoke clear English. I'm loosing money on this one. Again, use trusted booking sites such as <http://Kayak.com|Kayak.com> or <http://Skyscanner.com|Skyscanner.com>. <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> has heaps of hidden costs so don't be fooled by cheap flights.
5	Very impressed with easy checkout and speedy booking, many thanks!
4	Had a problem adding some extra luggage (due time to buy it was finished but had not been able to add it before because the links wouldn't open from <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com>), and my agent Patrik Vigoda did a great job, adding it past the time and at the regular online price, and added some reminder of other due times to finish my booking Great service and attention from this agent, I'm very happy with the experience overall.
5	Thanks for serving And a great help You officer Kristina Mikulova. She offered me fully and quick help. I thanked her again And happy employees , you have a lovely Kristina Mikulova.
5	I have been so thrilled with my experience with <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>. The site not only streamlines the booking process, but also provides clear details on the information that travelers need to know (e.g. Types of Visas needed). I myself found myself panicking when I realized I had not applied for my Australian Transit Visa for my layover in Sydney, but Jan was more than helpful by a) calming me down and b) directing me towards the services and individuals who could help me sort this out. Being overseas can be stressful, but knowing that there are genuinely caring representatives at <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> to help out their customers will definitely result in me continuing to use the site for my future flights. Thank you Jan!!!
5	I have used Kiwi as I needed to book multiple Ryanair flights and this is not possible via the airline  website. I have used the live chat to add additional services and spoke with Adam Jelínek and Dominika Vagnerova, they were both super helpful! Highly recommended.
5	Hi Miquelthanks a lot for our quick chat conversation!great support from your side.You are very helpful, now it can start:-)
5	No issues with my SkyPicker bookings; had a total of five different flights with two airline companies across Europe and basically had a fuss-free experience for a very reasonable price. Will use them to book my flights again.
4	I flew skypicker from Sharm El Sheikh to Ukraine and I had a few issues with filling in the form, understanding the details as it was not just one stop and I didn't understand a few details, however Customer service is excellent I had a lot of questions and they were all resolved with the live chat which are available all the time. We had a few hiccups however they were all sorted by the tireless staff and they even went the extra mile for me so I am very grateful. They need to be a bit more organised from the outset, perhaps informing individuals what to do with multiple flights when they are booked and the individual airlines' rules without having to ask. However cannot criticise the customer service at all. Thank you Petra and the team on the live chat!
5	I've had a very positive, fast and constructive experience on helpchat (Jan). I'm happy with his approach and knowledge although I've been asking basic questions he is answering many times a day. Rare experience thiese days. Keep up, guys!
5	I had a problem with incorrect date in one of the ticket and there was no problem to update it. With no fee, immediate help. I would like to say big THANK YOU to Abigail. I don´t need to buy another ticket :) Higly recommend <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com>
5	I had an unfortunate situation whereby a leg of my journey was changed by 12 hours. As the outward and return leg of the journey were with 2 different airlines it was very difficult to get a satisfactory resolution re alternative flights or refund. This created a huge problem which was professionally and amicably resolved by Kiwi (Michaela I believe). I was not in an easy mood to deal with  and I can't praise the staff (and particularly Michaela) enough for the way they handled me as a customer and my predicament.Many thanks.
5	With grateful heart...thanks so much to Lukas Janecka for being so attentive and helpful in answering all my queries regarding on my trip. Good job!!
4	Great service by Alan Whitfield when I called to get extra luggage booked on Vietjet Air for two National flights in Vietnam. Quick and easy!
4	We did contact Kiwi on their online chat service. The service we received from Sara was helpful and she managed to quickly change the date for our flight. Thanks for that!
5	Martin Carter helped us in faster and efective way, right answers and alternatives, super!
4	After som years I come across a quite effitient thinking ahead of the customers possible needs or usual mistakes. Something to be grateful for. I wish I could download the boarding pass straight to me iphone PASS application. Were there a way, please let me know. For the rest, quite satisfied so far. Issis was very kind on the phone.
5	I booked through kiwi and got tickets for $40 dollars less than any other website (including directly from the airline!). The flights were in high demand as the price of tickets were going up every few minutes on other websites but I got them! Within seconds, I got an email with my receipt. 20 minutes later, I got a text confirming my flights. I logged in to 'manage' my trip and entered in my ID number and printed my boarding pass. Super easy process!I am genuinely very impressed with Kiwi. The efficacy is fantastic and stress-free. Thank you! Will definitely use Kiwi again!
5	Customer online chat help was super fast and people at Kiwi were able to help me with my questions with in seconds :)! Like the chat - no need to wait on hold like when you are calling places - liked it!
2	the live chat worker was incompetent for the job and i had to tell her over and over what i needed to get done and still she didn't get a word of what i was saying.. i needed help with payment and the change of flight.neither of this happened ad i needed to buy a whole new flight instead.
4	Live chat helpline was very useful and quick at handling queries and addressing problems! thank you Alexey T.
5	I spoke to Eric on the phone about luggage restrictions on my flight. He found out the information, and promptly called me back. He was helpful, friendly and clear. I wish all customer service representatives were like him!Bhadra in New York
5	The service is the best I have used in the past 8 years I will be a regular customer ans I will highly recommend it to my friends family and any travelers I encounter
5	I had a chat with a company representative, Jan S, who was very helpful and knowledgeable. Helped me to check in in all of my flight legs in a matter of minutes!
5	I very much like all the processes in Skypicker, from the flight searching to the ticket reservation. It is easy to use, intuitive and clear. It gives you good options for travelling, and it offers good tools. The payment page is quite clear and it gives you all the information you need. I also got good prices. I had to call the support service a couple of times and they were great, very kind and efficient. I would really recommend Skypicker
2	i've made reservation through <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> for virgin australia, i've received the e-ticket, but when i call the airlines (Virgin Airlines) they said the code is unpaid... so decided to chat online through <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com>, first someone name Bogdan try to help me, he said he'll call the airline. but 2-3 hours didnt hear anything from him, so i chat again with someone named Emma, i've explained anything to her and she said the airlines office currently closed so she cant call the airlines, but i saw on the airlines website they said their contact is 24 hours service... so i gave the number to her... she said she cant call the airlines while in chat, so i end the chat... and until now, i didnt hear anything from her... my flight will depart less then 12 hours... and ddidnt get any information from kiwi.com...
5	I have used the chat to address an issue regarding the check-in and receiving the boarding passes. I was attended by Miroslava P and the service has been great! Within minutes I had received the boarding passes and the answer to all my questions.
5	Skypicker's customer service is excellent. I required some urgent help with my flight booking and am able to receive them from the live chat service. James was very patient and helpful as he was willing to go the extra mile to provide me the information I need.
4	Great Phone service. Sheap and good. A guy named Henry gave me some excellent help.
5	Skypicker Is Your New Source For Dirt Cheap Airfare: We here at Uproxx love cheap airfare. Travel is great, bu... <https://t.co/V1urXXU4Gz>
5	Jan S. promptly resolved my problem in a friendly and efficient way. The way I was helped will make me use <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> again.
5	I got my respond at once. The guy who was assisting me, Lukas helped me with all my problems and questions. Thank you!
5	I was a bit hesitant with ordering flights from a third party website that I hadn't heard of. We ran into an issue where we needed to have our luggage limit increased, I called customer support and they were very helpful and sent me a new link the following day to pay for the extra luggage. During the call the assistant also noticed that my flight was delayed and he promptly forwarded me an updated itinerary.  Great service Juan. Thanks!
5	I actually talked with 3 people, all of them gave me a great treat and helped me out quite successfully with re-booking/changing a flight. Thanks for fighting against Ryanair for me :D.Highly appreciate.Best,
1	"The service when our order failed 3 time, where ridicules! This shitty ASs Companys costumerservice is a dead Dogg saying ""i cant help you"""
4	I booked with Skypicker because they were the cheapest for the dates I needed to go, which was great. They booked with multiple airlines in order to get the cheapest rates. However, that meant they were not connecting flights. I had to leave the terminal/go through customs and needed to check-in for the following flight. Had there been any delays, it would be possible to miss a flight. Just an FYI. I was banking on the fact that there would be no delays.Their customer service was easy and helpful. I got a new passport so I reached out to them to change the passport number. They helped contact the airlines to make the change. They did not confirm with me that the change was made - I reached out myself.Nothing went wrong so the experience was great, but I can see how things may occur to make this a terrible experience. These mishaps are not due to skypicker though.
5	We found <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> quick and easy to navigate and book and were kept very well informed / reminded on when to print boarding passes before outbound flight and during our holiday for return flights. We chose to fly home by two flights from two different airlines via another airport to take advantage of extra time this gave us at our holiday destination and to cut costs and everything went extremely smoothly. Thanks
5	The Live-Chat-Service at <http://skypicker.com|skypicker.com> is fantastic! Jiří Červenka, the travel consultant I was chatting with, was very polite, friendly & fast. Nice service, thanks!
1	Don't book your holidays with this company...unless you want to book fake flights and be left stranded at an airport
1	We fel for that cheap deal of a transfer flights to Marrakech. Sadly we should have done otherwise than to book with Skypicker that booked with Ryan air. This must be a double bad combination.When we wanted to book check-in luggage we found out that you had to pay the price for every flight on the way which made it very expensive even though you only got 15 kg. When flying with Ryan air you have to check in again when you transfer (this can not be recommended).Ryan air changes their flight times again and again and on the way home Skypicker forgot to inform us about new changes and we stranded in Madrid. After hours of phone conversations they booked a new flight back the next day. We wanted an early flight but they wanted us on a late afternoon flight (because this was much cheaper for Skypicker). After many conversations we finally just said okay to a flight a few hours earlier than they suggested but not the early one we preferred.We were told that we had 10€ each to buy food and 100€ in total for a hotel. 10€ in an airport or at a hotel can buy you two waters and the hotel price around the airport is also more expensive than that! Of course we had to spend much more money especially to buy food when we got home nearly 20 hours later than expected. This long delay also costed us a day at work with no compensation.We were offered a 100€ voucher to be spend on our next travel with Skypicker, but this seems just comic then we never want to book with them again. We asked them to cover our expenses instead but his was not an option.Skypickers customer service replies kindly but with no true help or compensation. They do all that in their power to save money and the customers is the one that end up paying for their mistake.
4	Very helpful people working there! Special thanks to Aura! :)
5	"I'd like to recommend the wonderful response person ""Aliz"".I need to change the passport number to meet the entry condition for US but I don't have much time.I connected the chat 7/24 and Aliz kindly changed the correct number right now.I'd love to Aliz actions and I'd like to say again ""Thank you"""
5	Very easy booking & competitive pricing on <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com>.   Special thanks to Travel Consultant Tomas Sykora for a lightning fast follow-up through e-mail in providing me with my ticket numbers so that I could complete my travel visa application as needed.  Keep up the great work & excellent customer service!
5	As I entered a wrong email address when I booked my flight, i was not able to retrieve any details. But after getting in contact with <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> via the live-chat, Vlad was able to find the booking and amend all details. Happy that I finally have access to my ticket. Thanks again.Maurice
5	I wanted to save money and that's just what I got ~ along with some crazy routing.  But that's what I asked for and I was satisfied with the result.  Thanks <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>, I'll be back!
4	I'm hestitant to give five stars since I still have one check-in to go through but so far I'd say Kiwi's customer service is far better than most low-cost booking sites. Had problems with my online check-in but got quick help through the chat service (shout out to Valentin!) and am very pleased so far. Extra kudos for the e-mail reminders to fill out info online and avoid hefty check-in fees at the airport.
5	After my first experience with <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> I will definitely recommend its service to anyone and I will use it again on the next occassion!Special thanks to Karolina and Sabina from Warsaw office for very professional service and dealing with all my reservation queries successfully in a nice and very friendly way.:-DKatarzyna
5	very nice and friendly lady helped me quickly settle matters related to booking, I am very happy
5	I would like to thank <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> for a great and easy website also lovely customer service,I would like to thank Nina kasape for her great job and friendly chat also kind person.Thanks again.
4	no bad surprise between what.s told and what.s happens..especially about pricingWay too many vendor sites for air tickets...attract you with low price offers ...but at the last minute ...when you enter your credit card number the price has gone up the roofEvery person I have had on the phone was friendly and helpfulOne thing you should improve is the payment security ...using Verified or similar system..by which a digit code ( which is send to the client by SMS) is requested to finalize the paymentRegardsDenis
5	User-friendly website, best flight deals on the web, great communications and excellent customer service.  Ticks all the boxes. Happily recommend Skypicker for travellers.
5	I had some doubts about booking with Skypicker because I had no information about this company. However, I am grateful I did book with Skypicker! It ended up to be a wonderful choice, as they host the lowest rates in a very user-friendly web.
5	We had a connecting flight from Kolkata to Bali via Singapore. There was a 4 hr window between the two flights. But our first fight was 5 hrs late and as such we ended up missing the flight to Bali from Singapore. We didn't have a Singapore visa so our flight options were limited. Coz of that there was a risk of us getting stranded at Changi. The agents at kiwi spent over 3 hrs with me over the phone to find an alternate flight. They were patient and understood my situation. I really admire them for that. If I had booked the flights on my own, it would  have cost me $1200. Kiwi is highly recommended. As I mentioned there were 3 agents who patiently talked to me . Unfortunately I remember the name of only one . His name is Rupeni.S. The other two were equally awesome.
5	I am very happy with the service I was provided today. Enri A is a star, he/she was very professional and kind, he/she sorted my problem in one second.Thank you very much Enri A:) excellent and prompt service!
5	Thanks David for great support!
4	I did two calls to <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> because I booked unfortunately at the wrong date my flight. I phoned with Lukas and he was very helpful and had suporting answers to all my questions. In the end he could work out that I could change my flight for an additional fee of 100 Euros. The only thing that wasn't that great was the language-selection. At the beginning of every call to <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> you can choose the language. I choose twice german but the responser/whole call was always in english.
5	First time using <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> to book flights. Really easy process and got a great deal. Got emails prompting to provide travel document details and once we could check in the system did it automatically. Boarding passes were sent straight on with loads of time to spare. Booking multiple flights for multiple people so simple and easy.
5	The support of this company is really fast and reliable. Eugene helped me with the problem I had and was very positive throughout the whole conversation.
5	We were in time pressure to book flight on Palawan island. The SkyPicker was easy and quick even when I must tried two debit cards (first was blocked by bank). Payment process was straight-forward, followed by e-mail with invoice + eTicket, then boarding pass.
5	Booked a flight, boarding pass was missing. After a 3min chat with Lukas P all problems were solved. Couldn't ask for more.
1	I purchased a ticket with multiple legs in different locations but I noticed few seconds after booking that the last leg was the wrong location.  Called the customer service to help fix the issue and they told me they would be contacting me via email with updates. Chat with someone as well but she was not interested in helping me.  She stated it was too late to make the changes but I did not receive confirmation of the ticket until three hours late while still awaiting customer service to return an email with updates.  I will never be purchasing for this company again and I will make sure to let all my friends, co-workers and friends know what terrible customer service this company has.  Total disregard for their customers.
5	Hi I m ronak ... And I want number or email of name of this person KIRA plz if possible thanks
5	I needed help to change my document informations and thanks to the customer service by chat, it's been done in a blink!Thank you sooooo much!
5	Mayyaf,thank you very much for answering all my questions!
4	It all went very smooth and there wasn't really any trouble with anything and the online check-in was doubt free as well. Would definitely use Skypicker again.
5	I had mistaken in booking process, I immediately asked chatting and talked  what is need with them. They always showed considerable behaviours. I thank their helps. I suggest this chatting is wonderful and will be strong helps. Thanks Nina!
5	I was able to have a good overview of my options, when looking for a good deal on tickets for next month.  Great,  thanks & recommending
1	I am so surprised that after buying my ticket for 1264€ and i want to cancel my flight due to important reasons, you guys are refunding me back only 491€ excluding the tax. Is this a fraud company or what huh? Tell me. I was the one who booked and now i wanted to cancel due to some issues and now you guys are telling me that you can only refund me with 491€. And one thing am also surprised is when you use your own phone to call you guys you always say you will get back to me but you never.
5	"I just booked a flight from Birmingham to Malaga. As the confirmation email landed in my inbox I reclined in my chair, laced my fingers over my stomach and smugly chortled as I reflected on the ludicrously cheap tickets I had just secured. Mine was to be a summer of sun, sex and suspicious venereal diseases.As I began to imagine myself utterly naked, straddling a banana boat whilst attempting to digest a quart of vodka chemically more akin to Ronsil Wood Varnish; reality evacuated it's volcanic bowels over my craven fantasy. I HAD BOOKED THE WRONG FLIGHTS...Flailing like an oil soaked @codsandwich washed up on the shores of the Pacific, I madly scrabbled for my phone. Sweat dribbled over my fingers as I punched in Kiwi's customer service number. Ring ring, ring ring….. Delirium clouded my mind. Ring ring, ring ring...... My inflamed scrotum would not have time to be acquiesced in the wake of my pre-holiday wax….. Ring ring, ring ring..... I would be forced to sleep on the same beach where I had been woken by a local fisherman curiously prodding me with his harpoon…… Ring ring, ring ring…. ""Hello, Kira speaking.""The unmistakeable sound of an Eastern European matriarch thrust a virulent shaft of light into my mind’s black catatonia. Like when Ocean Rescue throw a life jacket to the captain of a pedalo caught in a shipping lane as he drifts hopelessly towards Somalia, I had a lifeline.  With furrowed brow and quivering hands I regaled Kira with my most troublesome of crises. “Could anything be done?” I pleaded in between sobs. Within twenty minutes Kira, at no extra cost, had successfully changed my flights to my preferred departure time. In jubilation I sank to my knees and wept tears of orgasmic euphoria. My foolishness had been vanquished and my summer saved. Victory was mine.I would like to take this opportunity to thank Kira and the rest of the team at Kiwi for the great work you did today. THANKYOU."
5	I have missed the check in dead line and Elsa C. helped me on the live chat surrface. I did not believe it will work, but it is super fast and Elsa was super quick. Thanks and keep up. Regards,Attila
5	I am very pleased with the help I received from Skypicker's support team who helped me with a change rebooking within a few hours.Thanks a lot!
5	My agent served me perfectly. Kind, helpful, personal, considerate...Worth 5 stars!
1	they have payment gateway error. they can charge u even 11 times above your limit. they just blame us. no option. so tricky
5	I was very satisfied, you have a large space for individual requests (30 kg baggage in my case), and even when one of my flights was cancelled, everything went well, they helped me a lot and I could even choose the option of replacement flight I wanted. I am very satisfied.
4	Thank you for everything.you always sent my bording cards .But,i asked one question about extra baggage on the web but you did not answer.
5	Dealt with a guy named Wally, wonderful, nice person and attention, done super quickly!
5	I used Kiwi for my last trip back home and have absolutely nothing negative to say about this service. I contacted the customer service on facebook regarding my boarding passes and they responded within a minute and managed to fix my issue in 5! I will definitely use kiwi again!
5	I needed confirmation of upgrade of baggage allowance and help with payment link and Filip provided both immediately
5	It is one of the best sites to book international flights, especially from India and to India
5	Straight forward, no nonsense responses from my chat attendant Jan Lukasek. Sorted my concerns quickly with no messing around.
5	Lucia and Filip have proved to be great workers! their continued support and great attention got me impressed. They were fast in giving me an anwser and alternatives to find out the best solution for my booking change. I am very happy with the attention received. I  no  doubt on using kiwi for my future fligths !
5	I can say, quite honestly, that Kiwi has the best chat service ever. They answer instantly and with constructive solutions for everything! A couple of minutes ago, David, was really helpful! His customer service skills prooves me that the whole company takes serious notes and hires the best people to work with them. I am positively satisfied!
5	Neil, the customer care representative, was very helpful and efficient.
5	Monica was exceptionally patient and articulate helping me through procedures for a 3 leg flight.  Her humor and responsiveness surely set her apart from most.  I wish she were flying with me!
5	Shu was great speaking and being assisted by someone who knows your country and background. Particularly when faced with flight challenges in a foreign country. Alan is a Star. I had given up on finding a flight to my home country. This was not just a flight but also very affordable. On my own I was getting sky high rate from Denmark to Gaborone. Alan I wish to thank you and your company. God bless you all.
5	Talked with Bek today to get some information about flight numbers that I couldn't locate.  They were very helpful and quick to reply on the live chat!
5	I am completely satisfied from the client service center.
5	I had to change some documents to my booking, and I have to say, that the swift and very effective way mr Giorgi L handled my request was awesome. Within minutes the issue was solved and changed. I love the efficiency the skyteam has!!!!
5	Needed help finding individual flight numbers, the customer service rep (Jan Lukasek) was very friendly and helped me find my flight numbers.  10/10!
5	A big thanks to Patrik Pivoda who helped me change my passport info through the live chat on the website. It was easy and painless. Great customer service and Patrik was very efficient, and he put up with my sense of humor. Thanks again!
1	This company is a ripoff!!! I booked a flight from London to Palma direct what I received was a flight to Germany with an 8 hour stop over & then onto Palma I tried to cancel it within 12 hrs no help no cancellation and still charged NEVER USE THIS COMPANY!!!!
5	"I used to call myself a ""travel ninja;"" it was a common practice for me to open 20+ browser windows to look at obscure stop-overs with a collection of budget airlines. All to get the best value for my money (without sacrificing too much time). Skypicker takes out all that stress by doing it for me. With one last minute, international jaunt, they saved me €400 euros by piecing together a combination that I never would have thought of myself. And, it only cost me an extra 2 hours of travel time. Make sure that you pack light, though! My combination of 4 flights on 4 carriers would have deeply cut into the savings, had I taken a large bag -- no-way to get out of playing those 4 baggage fees. Of course, skypicker warns you of this, when you book."
5	Amazing service! Quick, easy, friendly, and helpful thanks to Emma!!!!!!! She looked into every detail for our trip and quickly called and emailed me back.
5	My new flight company , make the price so much cheaper and the castumer serves from Juan CostaWas really personal, I will offer friends and family to try as well . Open new possibilities :)
5	Very good help....And fast support on chat...
5	This was my first time using <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com>.  From beginning to end, they have been very helpful and responsive.  Katrin (Kateryna) was great in customer service and helped us to change our itinerary very easily.  Will use <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> again!
5	It´s a great site and they arealways very helpful if there´s any problem with the booking :)
5	Yuliya was very helpful and I appreciate the assistance

1	I missed an international flight coming from VTE back to the states. I called and asked if there was something hey could do to help me with this.  I figured that I would be charged some kind of fee but instead they said the value of the tickets was already lost and they continued to try to sell me another one.  Is this normal practice? And I know that customers like myself miss flights all the time, so why would they not be willing to assist?  these people will rather try to sell you another seat rather than help and charge some sort off fee to help get this one time customer on the plan heading back to the states.  I feel liked I've been robbed.  I don't understand why you people can't help.
5	I like it because it shows more alternatives routes than the other websites of the kind,
1	Today noon my husband booked a ticket for next day travel to Mexico. Shortly after I was informed not to travel by my doctor due to a long awaited two appointment at the hospital was made possible. When we reached out to Skypicker customer service with my problem there were strict policies which didnt make it possible for us to get any help. No refund, no change of date, no help at least. We of course understand the policies in the booking, but would at least expect to get more help and support in a messy situation as we faced. We tried several times to get help from the customer service but showed indifference in our case. With No refound and any chance in my reservation , they just screw me over and sadly just lost my money, the money for my booking was a waste and now i can't  be able to buy my ticket again or  my money back.
3	Ho prenotato un volo su questo sito devo dire che sono davvero molto soddisfatta ho parlato anche telefonicamente con un consulte ed è stato gentilissimo mi ha spiegato tantissime cose sulla prenotazione grazie mille Carlo sei stato gentile !!!! Alla prossima !!!

5	Quick and effective chat assistance service. Radim (the person who attended me) was incredibly fast, efficient and fun to interact with!
5	The live chat is very helpful in case you have any issue.

4	Just to thank Irena, Yulia, Issis and Peter for their immediate answers for my questions regarding  a reservation, they ve been very gentle.
5	I chatted online with Radek and was very impressed with the level of customer service.  I also found the overall service of the company to be valuable to my travel experience
2	A startup that finds 'hidden' discount flight tickets just launched in the US <https://t.co/mMDvHOW5IF> <https://t.co/G26NJuGbQJ>
5	Kiwi is a great web-site and first of all - excellent support team :)I had some troubles with adding the extra luggage to my trip when I contacted Ryanair support, even though I had the details about the flight they would not help me. But the with the support assistance of Kiwi (thanks, David! ;)) it was fixed in no more that 10 min! Excellento! :) thank you
5	Noticed this morning when looking at Norwegian's site by chance that my flight was cancelled this evening from LAX to CPH - though strangely no advice from Kiwi.com......about that.Called the US number which took some 10 or 15 minutes to reply!But then found one Krystina R. who understood the issue (connecting flight in CPH) and she solved the problem with efficiency and reassurance within the hour. She even telephoned to make sure I had received the email with the rebooked flights.....Could not have asked for anything better. Congratulations to Krystina.
5	I have been booking a couple of flights with Kiwi for my trip in south America and I have been extremely pleased with the overall experience.The booking process is simple and clear and the policies on cancellations / refunds are well done. Usually one tends to be sceptical when using online brokers but I must admit my experience was very good.Most importantly while booking 2 separate connecting flights (as this resulted cheaper than buying a one way with a stopover) Kiwi encountered some technical issues which ended up in having to cancel my second booking. The following was very annoying since it meant having to either re-buy the second flight (at twice the price therefore making the whole hassle of buying 2 separate flights a waste of time and money) or having to completely reschedule, still resulting in a waste of time and money. I have called Wiki's customer service, explained my problem and, altough there appeared to be a problem with that specific flight, they were able to get me on that second flight without incurring in extra costs or hassles. Thank you Eleonora N. and Laura S, great job.
1	"Had I known that my first experience with this company would be this bad, I would have spent more money and avoid using their service.They used a wrong name to book my flights with Delta and JetBlue, whose representative asserted that unless the name on the reservations match with my legal name on my government ID, I will not be able to get on the flight. Even after seeing their mistakes on <http://Delta.com|Delta.com> and <http://JetBlue.com|JetBlue.com>, they insisted they will not change my name on the reservations, and even refused to fully refund my tickets. So this is basically how the call went with the representative from <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>:Me: ""Okay, so do you see the passenger information on <http://Delta.com|Delta.com>? The name on the reservation says ""XXXXXXXXXXX"". That's not my name. It's wrong.""Representative: ""It's not wrong."" What kind of company tells its customer that after misspelling his/her name? Mediocre service."
5	Great service, no problems, easy to use.
4	Some changes to my order were not updated (labeled as processing even after the flight itself). So when I needed invoices I had to contact online chat support. My request was resolved suprisingly fast and to my complete satisfaction. The communication was clear and polite. In my case I communicated with Issis, but the other time my experience with the support was just as good.I would recommend Kiwi, because even if you have some trouble, it is no problem to immidiatelly solve it online.
4	I had a very positive customer support experience by a person called Miroslava - she helped me via the text-based online chat to reserve assigned seats on my flight. The interaction was very smooth and positive. 5 stars for the support interaction. But 4 stars instead of 5 to <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> in this case, because this ought to have been possible via the web UI (without needing to call customer support).
1	The worst experience ever with Skypicker. My flight was cancelled at last minute and they did not offer an alternative flight same day. They offered flying 3 days later but they could not change my return dates meaning my holidays to be cut from 7 to 3 days, as I did not accept this for obvious reasons they only refunded half of the ticket when the airline was willing to refund the whole ticket. Basically, if I would have booked with the airline directly I would have got my full refund.They argued my return ticket was not affected and of course it was , I could not going to have only 3 days of holidays when I booked one week off. I made a single booking under one booking reference and they ended up splitting it up at their convenience.Never ever again with Skypicker. Agents are square minded, my case was missmanaged.
5	Hana was the best, and went out her way to help! BEING Not so computer savy ,but she is!!!! THxS AGAIN ,Hana- Happy Holiday  2 U!!!!!!!!!
4	Provided help in no time.Best support seen till now.Kudos to Jan Lukasek for your great work.
3	I've bought the ticket Odessa-Prague on 10November. Can I cancel it now or change the name and passport number of a passenger?
5	Excellent service, I was having problems with my reservation, but with the 24/7 Live Chat, Jana Zámečníková really helped me solve it in a matter of minutes! Would totally recomend this company!
5	Faste and simple service, needed some information about the luggage phoned the customer service and Luis Silva provided all the needed information and was quite helpfull.
5	i am so happy that i booked from skypicker its amazing and i recommend every traveler to book from it  =)
5	Had some trouble with my booking, so i called and got exellent help from Roman. It all worked out so I avoided extra fees at the airport. Thanks!
5	I had a very positive experience. I made a mistake with the name on the flight booking (completely my fault).  I contacted Kiwi immediately after via the chat / IM interface.  They asked me to simply email a copy of my passport which I did.  They then called me and took care of the contacting the airline, fixing the name change at no additional cost.  I have just booked another flight with them which is really easy given the single page confirmation and check out.
5	"My wife was using KIWI for the first time booking a flight ticket and mistakenly paid for the wrong dates. KIWI was very responsive and Monica (twice!!), Henri and especially Vitalii Nikitin gave quick comprehensive service and, although there was a higher fee due to the change, thankfully she did not lose out greatly.Do note that they give an opportunity to review the flight details before paying and clearly state ""no refunds"" (and she still missed that) but the agents were ALWAYS courteous, patient and respectful and truly helpful. The agents had great follow-through and even called her back to update her when changes were able to be made. We definitely recommend KIWI and recommend reading the fine print BEFORE clicking/paying!!!! Look for a follow up review at the end of November to rate the actual travel experience!"
1	I had a booking in kiwi, then kiwi cancel the flight. The problem is my credit card still got bill full payment, no refund until now. I am still waiting reply email from kiwi to refund the money since my booking was cancelled.
5	thank you very much to Jakup and Lukas from <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>!!! Very good and fast service!!!
5	Tomas was very helpful on the live chat. He provided me with all of the information I needed to make an educated choice about my flight, and he was also very polite. Thanks a lot!
5	Thank you Agent Romain fro the information. thank you Skypicker for the best deal of tickets. I surely will recommend this to my friends and students
5	Had to add some details to the booking, Miroslava (the agent) sorted it out nicely
1	Extremely bad experience. Would give zero stars but 1 is the minimum. Booked a Scoot flight via Skypicker, got the wrong date and asked for it to be changed. According to Scoot's conditions of carriage, the change fee is waived if the request is done within 12hrs from when the booking was made. Skypicker said they would call me the very next morning, but in fact, took a whole week to get back to me, and only after I had to contact them again to check and chase. When they finally got back to me, only to reject the request. Tried contacting Scoot directly, but because it was so long after the booking was made, they too rejected me and I still had to pay for the change fees and the fare difference. (I have escalated to Scoot and they are in the process of reviewing the possibility of giving me a one time refund in view of this situation.)This is a case where the customer is disadvantaged because of the incompetancy of Skytracker booking agents. AVOID SKYPICKER AT ALL COST. Book directly from the airlines own website.
5	Jonathan is very kind and do things very efficiently!!!!
5	Julia helped us very well and she answered very quickly so we could make   our schedule right. Thank you very much, Julia
4	I booked the flights over email, was told I had to enter my passport details into the site otherwise I'd be charged. So I went onto the online chat service whom I spoke to Karen who was very helpful and kind and tended to all my problems going further and beyond to help. Thanks!
1	"My flight was delayed so Kiwi told me that they would reroute my connecting flight.  They said it would have to be another airport (Heathrow instead of Gatwick).  They said not to worry about transportation between the two airports because they would reimburse me up to $100 for the transfer.I took a train, then a taxi to Heathrow.  Now, after sending in receipts for reimbursement, they won't honor the agreement.  A representative made a note to say ""look what we've done for you already"" as if it were anything to do with the agreement we made.  Now I'm out the money that I wouldn't have spent if they didn't say they would reimburse me.I feel cheated and lied to for being a good client that followed their suggestions and just wanted an honest experience.H"
1	I bought a ticket for someone coming to lecture on our course and they  have not accepted her ticket number from <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> so she sits in Joburg (and not Harare) while I run around trying to sort this out - with no reply from Kiwicom - not impressed at all!!!
5	Good service. If any problems occur with reservations, Custom Support contacts you immediately and provide with all relevant information regarding flight details, etc.
5	Everything was pretty cheap and provided an easy view of the situation regarding your travels, even with transfers. When wanting to change stuff in my reservations I found that the online chat with an employee by the name of David was a pleasant and extremely helpful experience, it feels like talking to a real person and is live-support in its essence. Everything went fast and David was an accomodating and helpful hand in a situation that is often confusing, thank you.
5	I had computer issues that caused me to confirm and pay for a flight reservation that I didn't want! I immediately saw that <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> had a live chat option. It only took a few minutes to connect with someone. Lucie was able to solve the problem in just a few minutes. The ticket was not confirmed with the airline yet so she was able to send a refund. Thank you!!
5	Did not have any problem at all. All bookings worked perfekt. did also have Boarding pass avaiable well in advance.
5	I booked my flight with Skypicker. Later i had som problems with the dates so I had to reschedule. Thanks to Gabi at Skypicker it all went smooth and one hour later i had my new booking. Gabi helped me through livechat and he was very helpful. Thanks Skypicker and special thanks to Gabi =)
1	I had to cancel a return flight, since I would be staying longer. I called the company weeks before the trip and the Company made me belief I had a refund coming, because I choose to travel to my destination, but not back. Instead of cancelling the whole trip I followed their advice. They told me to contact them after my return flight had departured and so I did. After two emails and two weeks of no answer they replied they would look into it. 9 days after I recieve an e-mail saying it was not possible to get a refund - something they choose not to tell me before I have had the trip. This type of business is not recommended!
4	Got good enough prices and all, handy to use when I'm traveling.But the real good thing is the livechat customer support! Gotta love those guys. Just talked with Eva and Seth, some chill Czechs right there (sorry Eva and Seth if you are not from Czech, I just assumed...). They helped me out and answered my questions, real nice and chill, should be promoted. Hope Seth really did give Eva a high five, i like to think that he did, seemed to be a man of his word (based on him being chill). Easy and cool to use the livechat, would recommend it. Hope they stay cool and chill there, and helpful as always. This might go to a different support team or something...not sure. But if I get any official reply to this, please include something that might make me laugh, something fun:)
4	Although I had some troubles with the online booking system not wanting to process my payments, after escalating the issue to the supervisor, Aamer, he was able to help me greatly. He ensured that my e-mail to the IT department was prioritized and my issue was solved within a half hour. Thanks for your above-and-beyond service.
4	I found this website/company to be extremely helpful in finding flights that I could afford.  It was an easy to negotiate process.  I'm hopeful that all goes smoothly at the airports.  Special thanks to Enri A., who helped me out during a live-chat on the website.
5	I had accidentally bought a flight for the wrong day. I was very concerned that I had just wasted a lot of my money and was going to have to buy a new plane ticket. Instead I used the 24/7 live Kiwi chat. I was able to tell someone my situation. The next day I had received an email about the flight options I could choose for the correct day. I talked to Jan S. and she was extremely helpful. She was able to contact the airline I was flying through and get me a ticket for the right day for free. <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> fixed my mistake within a day. I highly recommend booking through their website.
5	helps me well to add a second bag to my planes
5	Stumbling across Skypicker was like discovering a hidden treasure. It was easily among, if not the, cheapest search engine out there for airfares. I've recommended Skypicker  to everyone who has asked. ITA and Google Flights should be looking over their shoulders at this rising star!
5	Petra was great service! she helped me a lot!
4	I love the instant customer service available at the website. I got my specific questions answered right away. Also Radim deserves a raise! Very pleasant and personable, and answered my questions quickly.Haven't flown yet, but so far so good!
2	RT @businessinsider: A startup that finds 'hidden' discount flight tickets just launched in the US <https://t.co/3I9uL6LK0O> <https://t.co/aRd>…
5	I have been very satisfied from call center of <http://KIWI.COM|KIWI.COM>.In particular ALICE W. has been very effective, helpfull and competent. Thank you Alice W.
4	Speaking of cheapest, can you please clarify what's your MARKUP on top of the normal ticket cost? I've noticed that the tickets are way cheaper when bought directly from the airline, I just would like some clarity so I may make an informed consumer choice. Couldn't find any information on the website or through the booking systems.Many thanks.
5	Brillant Service .. Especially by NIZAR. He was very helpful. Many thanks.
5	Such a great costumer service! Really helpful!! Thanks a lot!!
5	We had issue with a flight to Russia which meant we couldn't make the first half of our connecting flight, Ajinkya was amazing and using the online chat facility sorted it out for us in a few minutes. We have used skypicker before and they have been brill. Id like to day thank you to Ajinkya for sorting this and for your professionalism I would certainly recommend and use them in the future. :)

5	I had searched a lot of sites looking for a good deal on tickets to India when I found SkyPicker.  Their site is easy to navigate on and they had the best deals on the Internet.  I will so be using them again for my next trip.
5	Used the chat and chatted with Martin. He solved my problem and was very helpful. 10/10
5	whee, free money for y'all! <https://t.co/LCx2aFMj0A> <https://t.co/Tz6btQDTuj>
1	Bad service. I advise you to pay my refund. I have tried to email you several times without an answer. I advise all not to use this Agency and I will contact all international services that help you getting your Money back
3	I have had a frustrating experience so far with trying to get my travel questions answered through online support. The travel consultants are normally quick to reply to your first inquiry and then stop answering once you try and get down to business. I had one good experience so far with Gabriela K., who sent my inquiries to the booking department to get everything underway quickly and amicably. I'm hoping that my itinerary goes as planned and that there will be no problems with my flights. Other than that I do recommend skypicker.
5	Excelent attention, Eva helped me a lot, and very fast, awesome service.
4	Hi! Thank You Marketa Bisova for making our day by founding us suitable trip to Bruxells.
5	i used the online chat service to change passport details because of a new passport and alikhan was very helpful and a credit to your company  ! thank you so much !
1	I had the worst experience ever with this company. When I booked my ticket I realized there was a mistake with the date of the flight so I called them the very next day of booking my ticket.  The ticket was still refundable, however instead of refunding it they told me they will help me change the date. They told me they will call me back. They didn't, when I called them back they said it's now to late to refund it and to change the date will cost as much as the ticket. They said they did everything they can but I will have to just lose that money and book a new flight on my own. I was shocked. I called the delta the airline I booked through kiwi, and they checked the history and told me kiwi never tried to cancel my ticket and get me a refund they wanted to just change the date and charge me extra for changing the date. I called delta directly and they helped me right away and offered me a full refund because they can see I called within the refundable time frame. Delta told me the refund has to go through kiwi. 3 weeks later I finally get a letter that my refund was approved however they only gave me half of my money back. Now again I have to spend hours on the phone with them and still no help. Never again!
2	Very poor experience with @skypickercom takes forever to process simple Ryanair booking and blaming Ryanair for that? WTF #skypicker #slow
5	Selorm - gave me a really good service
5	Thank youI booked a flight on kiwi and by some mistake i gave my visa number instead of passport number. So one of their traveler assistant name gio give a fast help regrding the matter! I was very satisfied with his assistance.!excellent! Keep up the good work buddy.
4	I wanted to upgrade my baggage option. I had difficulties how to do it, my flights was in 48 hours. but consultants were really nice, they tried so hard to help me. First, I chatted with Maria Zamkovska.She really really helped me to change my option. I asked a lot, and she nicely answered and gave good information. Those helped me to decide and change my option. Also I chated with Vladimir. also nice. helped me to get boarding passes so fast. thanksI had difficulties to pay. So I hope <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> to improve payment system.but other than that, service was really nice. Thank you for helping me. I love chatting service here. Help a lot especially in urgent,.
5	Natalya Petrishina from Skypicker advised me very professionally and promptly on baggage allowance on my flight. Thanks Skypicker team for their support and readiness to help!
5	Facing having to Fight with EasyJet about refunding new tickets due to a cancelled flight it was fantastic being met by an online support agent at <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> by the name Adam Jelínek. He was helpful and gave great guidens. If all supporter have the attitude of Adam there will be no unsatisfied customers. Hopefully I will get My money back.
3	I booked with Skypicker and they must have made an error and booked the wrong day... I had to reach their customer service to change it.Fortunately, it was a very smooth customer service experience... a rep named Phana helped me through what could have been a very frustrating change, and she made the unfortunate incident bearable. Be very careful when booking, their information might be off. Good CS thought!
5	Really nice assistance from Artem Krohin! Thank you!
5	The online chat service is great. They answer within seconds and they are helpful and gentle. Personally I had an issue with my check in, and my agent Ivana Vlahovic assisted me a lot, with patience and perfect guidance! I totally recommend Skypicker!!!
1	Really stupid that we have to check inn the luggage again if we have one or more stops to the final destination !!!
5	I got a lot of question when i spoke with great Zuzana and she was awesome. reply all the questions in very profession way and very courtesy.many tnx Zuzana.
5	They had the best price and the best itinerary from Zanzibar to Cape Town. I also know they got some problems booking the tickets after we had payed, that they resolved. Good customer service.
5	I was a little bit confused about my flight reservation to Las Palmas so I did a phone call to Skypicker helpdesk to ask for explanation. Customer agent Míša did well and answered all my following questions. It was a great example of an excellent customer service attitude. Keep holding such a standart. Regards. Pavel Síč
5	Very kind and quick chat supprot. I was satisfied with it. Especailly I wanna give compliment to agent Miroslava P.
5	Lukas H was extremely helpful and nice. He answered my questions and sent me an email with all of the information I requested. Will recommend <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com>
3	@skypickercom still being unprofessional and denying responsibility for giving incorrect information.
5	I have had an excellent and very helpful chat with Martin Carter who helped me out to sort out my problems in a very fast responding way. Thank you kiwi for your well organised customer service.
5	Had a quick and easy online chat with Anna who was extremly helpful. Thank you for making booking online that much easier :)
4	Eleonora and Valeria helped much with my reservavion, always were to the pending and me responded with speed, i am very grateful.

5	"Dears,I never do a review and usually it is easy to be upsaet about ""telephone assistance"". This is NOT definitively the case of SKYPICKER. For different reasons I had to deal with their Customer Care Phone Service, once with Mrs. Elena Sheykis and then with Mr. Jiří Červenka and they were in both cases extremely kind, professional and efficient in solving my problem. Simply THANKS guys and congratulations for your Service and Professionality! I forgot to say: their Customer Care Phone Service replies in 5 rings, not later, and you find ONE PERSON ANSWERING, and you do not have to listne to 7 minutes of songs... eh!Best regards,Rodrigo"

5	Great customer service through the open live chat option, I had all of my questions answered within a few minutes by Henry which saved me time from calling in. Would highly recommend skypicker for future flight bookings.
5	I went into uneasy situation when one of the flight carriers abruptly changed timing of my for a long time prepared flight. Just after a kind assistence of <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>, namely Mr Urbanek and Ms Hruba from your Czech office (maybe with the help of other co-workers?)  AirAsia rearranged its earlier decision to my full satisfaction. I am sure I will use service of <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> again.
4	Lucie was quick in providing the help needed. Was helpful and polite. Keep it up!
5	I want to thank Radek for a very good support by phone. My problems were solved immediately and I was greatful for that. Thank you Kiwi.
5	Best Customer Service, Natalya was great, fast and to the point.
5	When you have a problem, you appreciate someone who can offer the answer that you are looking for. Ele was the one who quickly solved my doubts kindly and efficiently.Thank you, Ele. It was a pleasure.
4	A faulty document was sent to me and I received a replacement with an apology within 10 minutes.  Kudos to Yulia K. and Alina B.!
1	"I'm sorry but my experience with Skypicker is very bad : I paid for two airplane tickets from Cancun to Port au Prince via Fort Lauderdale on Skypicker. With Spirit Airlines . I paid to You.The first one Cancun/Fort Lauderdale was OK, but at Fort Lauderdale Airport, the flight was cancelled few minutes before departing, letting a lot of passengers ""on the floor"" !!!!Since this day, I'm waiting about my money back.Can You send me my money back please?Réservation: A5TF7C"
5	Very helpful in updating details of a difficult itinerary, one that costs thousands of dollars more on other websites. Easy to use website and helpful customer service. I'll be booking with them again!
4	I dealt with Tony in Fiji and he was incredible! He was patient with all of my questions, even when I repeated them. He made me feel comfortable with booking, and assuaged any concerns about short layovers. I hope there are no issues w/ the layover but I feel confident Kiwi will help us if we get into a sticky situation :)Thanks Tony!
5	Easy booking, no problems in payment and got answer to my email inquiry in some hours.
5	excellent!the staff was realy useful with me.Lucy thank you for everything and at all staff thank you.the nex time I will booking with you!
5	Hello it s the first time i used skypicker and unfortunetly i had some problems with the check in. Thanks Tomas Krivanek for the help and the short time i had to wait for solving my problem.All the best
5	The chat assistant was very helpful and patient. I can recommend their service.
4	Good prices, easy to use site and great, timely service by using chat and e-mail with Tomas P.
5	Fantastic help and service from Miroslava P. Thank you!
5	I will have my first flight ever(Bucharest to Marseille) and i was a bit nervous. So i contacted the online chat and there was Mr. Pedro who explained me everything i was concerned of with the utmost of detail. Thank you very much! :-D
4	It's funny how one person can make or brake the reputation of a company.After days trying to add extra luggage on my already paid for holiday. The whole process was getting extremely frustrating. I was starting to lose my cool facing the idea to pay at the check-in. I must have spoken with at least 6 people getting conflicted information.But then Anastasia Fatourou came to save the day. I've contacted her over the live chatroom and she understood what needed to be done and efficiently contacted the airline while giving me updates on the progress step by step in the chatroom.Within minutes my luggage was added and paid for with her help, and I can carry on with my trip with no more stress.She added at least 2 extra starts on my review today!
5	I was assisted by Alan Whitfield who was helpful and very speedy at his job and provided me with all the information I needed to ensure a great flight
4	Hi i got help from the live chat. The person Romain answered me very quickly and gave me good respond and answered all my questions nicely. I recomend you to use the chat if you have any questions :)

5	I was in Santiago when I heard that my flight from Santiago to Calama was incorrectly issued or processed. I immediately called customer service. Customer representative, Puput Cibro helped me on the phone as best as she could. She looked for alternative routes and tried to resolve my case as I was stuck at the airport with my family. Another representative (which I do not remember her name), was also very helpful to help me resolve my problem. Thank you very much for all your help.
1	"I recommended that absolutely NO ONE do business with <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com>.  I went to change a flight I booked to a new destination.  I wanted to change the flight from Dublin - Edinburgh to Dublin - Inverness.I double checked the entry and made the selection for the change in airfare.  When I received a confirmation email, the submission was incorrect.  The timing was what I had selected, but the flight was still Dublin - Edinburgh.  The website didn't correctly display Dublin - Inverness flights.  I now see (based on the trust pilot reviews) that this issue has occurred to several people accessing their site recently.I immediately called to rectify the situation.  I have since been told that the investigation shows that <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> is not at fault and I am not going to receive either the correct flight or a refund.To boot, I can't go back and change my flight again to show the option I selected and take a screen shot the issue.  I can only select a ""history"" button now.The bottom line is that I have been flying for 25 years and never experienced such an issue.  Moreover, the problems I've had with <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> exceed the airline industry.  In my entire life, I've never dealt with such a disingenuous and fraudulent company.I promise to fight them tooth and nail via credit card company, U.S fraud protection services, and the better business bureau to get my stolen money back.  I recommend you all do the same.In the interim, I hope this message serves as a deterrent to people choosing <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com>.  The best we can collectively do is put these thieves out of business."

5	No too often is service as helpfull as Ms. Marketa... many thanks
5	I recently booked 6 tickets from Los Angeles to Barcelona and not only were the tickets about 25% cheaper than anywhere else but when one of the passengers I bought a ticket for needed a change, they were extremely helpful and patient with my issue.  It took several days for them to get the airlines to fix the problem but they were persistent and organized even though I spoke to different Kiwi customer service people over that time.  They even called me back when my cell phone dropped our connection.  I will definitely use them again.
5	I had to cancel a reservation and agent Julia handled it very well in a fast and effective way!
4	@skypickercom Why is my full creditcard number including name and expiration date on my e-ticket that is sent in a plain-text email?
5	Thanks James for assisting me in my query re: unaccompanied baggage / adding a 3rd suitcase to my trip. Thanks for being professional and thorough, as well for offering to contact me via email with the information that I requested so that I don't have to sit and wait for answers on the chat.
5	Thanks so much to Leah for immediate help with my booking. Really great service :)
5	Thank you, Alexey Tudakov, Travel Consultant, for excellent service, fixing everything for our trip to Brussels this weekend. You should be proud of the job you are doing :-)
5	I had some problems because of wrong dates on tickets but only one message to Skypicker and they fixed that and successfully changed dates so everything was fine.
4	Thank you to Juan Mena-Costa at Sky Picker for giving great service twice on my travel.
3	Buyer beware,,,,  you may be charged extra for your checked in luggage when making connecting flights due to Skypicker representatives not knowing the different requirements with the different airlines which they contract with.
5	Very helpful customer service! I would recommend them for this reason.
5	I found the customer care assistant I spoke to Anas Hallel very friendly and he really put me at ease about an issue with my trip that I was worried about. Thanks for that Anas.
4	"I was apprehensive about using Sky picker, after many experiences booking international flights by myself through airlines. My experience with airlines is tainted by the sneaky booking process where they try to scam extras from the unwary. It is a constant competition to get what you are applying for without getting ripped of for the ""other stuff "" you don't need.None of this with sky picker. I paid quick on line and they followed right through to online boarding pass. Everything was clear and as stated. I had no worries or issues, a stress free trip., the process was very user friendly.  I was pleasantly surprised ,The fares were very cheap. AWESOME ,THANK YOU SKYPICKER. I am booking flights for my wife and return for myself, I will go to Skypicker first."
5	There was a problem with my checked in baggage. But because Mistakes happen in general, I voted for the quick response, the ability to solve the problem and how easy was to contact them. Thank you!
4	I have booked 2 flights with Kiwi and they were great! Just be careful when booking your baggage and take note of how much is allowed. I had to contact customer services via live chat and was appointed Miroslava P as my agent. She was great and was able to answer all my annoying questions about baggage and clarify the situation promptly.Thank you very much Miroslava P.
3	Your Customer Service has also intructed her to PURCHASE ANOTHER TICKET to Madrid. How is this even a solution when SKYPICKER is at fault? Take responsibility for your actions.
5	It is often difficult to book a trip from multiple (3 or more) cities using other sites, however; I felt that Skypicker was able to make this process painless for me when I booked my trip from Denver to Tampa, Tampa to New York and New York to Denver. Most importantly, because I was checking a bag in each one of these flights I did not have to go through the hassle of going through the airlines website because Skypicker gives you this option during the flight selection/payment process to pay for your bad upfront. This is a nice added feature, especially if you are using multiple airlines. I would recommend Skypicker to anyone , the service is totally worth it and I will definitely use it again in the future!
5	I bought my ticket from this site with a really good price. I had an issue because of my sloppery while entering my personal information at the time i am buying my ticket but after i have contacted live support, represantatives Katerina, Jiri and Tomas worked really fast and made it right.Great customer service, never doubt about it.
5	Kind and professional
5	I would like to thank Eoghan for patient and helpful attitude.
5	We forgot to fill in our travel document details, but Kiwi support chat, Jan Lukášek in particular, helped us in a few minutes to solve the problem and avoid paying extra fees for check-in on the airport! Great help, thanks a lot! I would recommend <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> to anyone!
5	RT @bdeithrick: I've just booked my flight with @SkyPickerCOM. Find some great deals too at <https://t.co/LwVlloOPrn>
4	Waiting time was for me to long but Seth is very professional and I wanted to thank him. Thanks again Seth.
5	Kiwi is very intuitive - it gave me all the information I needed and guided me through my search, booking and management steps. I totally recommend for its easy multi options on search and easy to follow-up afterwards on email. Great platform!
5	I have cancelled our team's filght tickets due to mistake made by me. We were aware of Skypicker's policy and merely thought they will cancel it. After receiving confirmation mail from airline, Skypicker had to contact with the ariline and kindly gave us full refund. The process was fast enough thanks to real time chatting. I really enjoyed service and hospitality of Skypicker.
5	I had a great experience, thanks to a very professional and kind customer service representative called Pavel.
5	Athough I often use Skypicker to find the best dates to fly, Expedia remains my favorite travel site. <https://t.co/aeEIiOD23j>
5	The service is easy to use. The website offers all needed info at glance, with excellent overview of flight options.After booking two flights, I was bit concerned that my booking cannot be found on ChecckMyTrip, but in the end there were no issues with it. On both flights we got very good seats in 2nd row.
2	I bought my fligt form Kl to Oslo via Bangkok with <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>.I have doubts regarding how much will it cost to add some lugagge (I already added 20 Kg). As I am flying first with Royal Jordania I know they allow 30 kg, but that is not the case with norwegian airlines. So, one od the questions is if I can fly with 30kg + hand luggage with Royal Jordania, and then then check with Norweguan Airlines. I went to Kiwi. com, tried to chat with them but only automatic answers pop in, tryed to call them but there is only a machine talking, sent them 2 e-mails but got no answer. I can't neither find the answer in their FAQ.That is not what I call a 24/7 service... I would like to talk to a person regarding this matter.
5	Very good customer care. Bek was very helpful, calm and solved my problem quickly.
3	So far nothing to complain about, Radek in chat support even swiftly helped me with my sloppy mishap as I had used an invalid email adress when buying the ticket.
1	I asked for a refund and they declined it saying no refund unless it's reasonable. I told them that im in the marine corps and my major disapproves of me going to my destination over the holidays. I told them that it's because it would be too dangerous at that time and because of the weather. I even put insurance on it just in case of anything. I should have went on cheapoair where u can guarantee ur money back. Kiwi airlines put me threw a lot of stress. Just to try to cancel it.
5	This is my 1st time using <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> to book my flight ticket.The confirmation abit delay while my bank already charge on my account.And the booking confirmation send it to me after 1 hours.If possible to speedup the confirmation would be much better.
5	The people in the support and Monica helped me a lot by being patiently listening to my mother's problem making another reservation for my nephew who is not allowed to travel alone because he is just 17 years old. Both of you tried your best and quick to help us to get the air ticket for my nephew can go in the same plane, the same trip with costing any more money.You are so patient, so friendly and so helpful.Next time when we go back from Oklahoma to Danang we will get your air tickets.Thank you very much.
1	Don't recommend using, odds are you will pay the same with any other site. Luggage information not clearly stated. When contacting there was no assistance whatsoever.
5	I would like to say thanks to <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> Costumer Support, especially to  Leonardo M. and Lukas J.,who helped me very quckly to solve my issue.  Keep it up!!
5	Thanks Tomáš Mužík taking the time to answer all of my questions thoroughly and make me feel well taken care of. I appreciated your time very much and wish that all interactions with customer service could be so positiveJs
5	I was helpled through a online chatroom with Juan Costa. He did a wonderful job helping me with the flight information I was confused about.  Quick service with and he is a pleasent representative.
5	Very good travel consultant simon h.
1	Customer ServiceFirst of all, the customer rep knew what i am typing on the chat even before I send the message, which was pretty uncomfortable.They were pretty rude in conversation in chatIn the end, they were not helpfulIt is not good for intercontinental flights(North AMerica-EU, South ameria-EU, EU-Asia) for all nationalities due to luggage, no automatic transfer of luggage as they use low cost airlinesI think the website is not good if you are not EU citizen or US citizen. You should not book it from this website if you not EU or US citizens.Reasoning: they use low cost airlines like transavia, ryan and combine them with bigger international airlines like air france,british airways etc. You will often see 2-3 stop flights when booking with themBiggest Problem with such combination: Luggage : Low cost airlines do not support those luggage limits that bigger international carrier support. So you will be paying extra for luggage. Also, low cost airlines stop at smaller airports and the transfer is a problem at these airports.Eg. I was flying from turkey to Morocco. I used Pegasus airline, which stopped at this smaller airport near Paris. There I had flight from Transavia airlines to Morrocco. I boarded the flight like 10 minutes before and that too it was made possible by this one airline member from transavia. In order to transfer, I have to call from phone booth to both pegasus and transavia. Pegasus needs to get my checked in luggage and transfer it to transavia airlines. While transavia airlines needs to check me in with my carry on, they have to go through this separate exit where a special room for transfer. He has to call all the people to specially come for me and check me and do my security for <http://transfer.It|transfer.It> took me 2 hours and 30 minutes and it was made possible only by transvia crew. He really fought it.This happened because I do not have schengen visa so I can go out of the border to pick my luggage. These two airlines being low cost airlines do not automatically transfer the luggage. This is despite the fact I do not need any transit visa and there is a transfer service at the airport but just nonfunctional one.However, the point is obvious that mixing international big airlines with these low cost airlines can work only if you are citizen of EU and US as you can go out and get in with no border control. But even for these citizens, luggage will be an issue if it is more than 1 bag. Also, even for these citizens they have to pick up their own luggage each time.Booking Issue:Even though, you provide them nationality information well in advance before the booking, they do not tell you if the airlines are point to point airlines.In my case, I got the booking with no information that the airlines is point to point and due to this the airline do not support transit. My airline said the agency should have notified you while booking and its their mistake.I contacted <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> to correct their mistake asking them to give me an alternative. They refused to accept the mistake. While providing me alternative, they said they will charge me 1100 euros for the new booking. So I lodged the complaint with AESA and EU Aviation. Meanwhile, I got the Emirates flight for 600 euros which is half the price of what <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> offered me as an alternative.This is happened to me on the return when flying out of Morrocco and Ryan airlines said theya re point to point airlines and I said I am just transiting, to whihc they said, they do not support transit.
5	Thank you for the good support Tomas Krivanek! 5 out of 5!
5	I received a kind attention and service from Catalina L, my main issue was that i didnt know how to add another bag, she was very helpful and kind and checked with the airlines of the flight how to add it and the cost, she help me a lot with this. it was an efficient and in my opinion trustworthy service with a clear and quick manner to resolve my questions and doubts.
5	Lenka from Kiwi .com made my day today, by helping me adding additional extras to my booking. I would say her response was outstanding. Thank you so much again.
5	Had an excellent experience with Lukus P! He was wonderful with helping me take care of a minor hiccup in my checl in! Excellet and friendly customer service!
5	Im travelled with Kiwi com now for the 4 th time, for exelent services of Martin oan Vlad d
5	This was my first use of <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> and I can only recommend this service. The site is well build and easy to use. I had to do two reservations as the flights provided by Kiwi did not suit me for a return flight but that is not a big deal as it is impossible to provide everyone with the way they want to fly, but they provide option to order any kind of flight which helps you build your own way how to fly from where.
4	So far the service as been good. I'll update this comment when I reach my destination without any major dilemmas
5	It's very nice travel agency!!I got quick responses for my issue by live chat.Thank you so much for Yuriy Novgorodov, and others Skypicker's members who are replied my message. They were very nice costumer service! ^^
5	I didn't know how to finish my checkin ticket so I asked for support. Magda P. helped to me with everything and resolved my problem with some minutes! I gave her some passport data and she did everything so fast and comfortable. Thank you so much!
4	Works as intended, they could be better about their bags and unprotected connections policies.
5	Anna Alaxinova was my service consultant. I needed a breakdown of the costs per passenger in an invoice. She went the extra mile to offer to have each passenger's cost be send individually. =) Wonderful service! She even help me to follow up on the earlier case of a passenger's name I accidentally key in wrongly on my end. Thanks Anna once again for the help!
5	Miss Natalia answered to my question, and didn´t stop until she got what I needed, she called me ones and ones again until she was sure I was satisfied with your service, she has given to me the best face on you, congratulations for having that kind of employees, I represent a group of students from México, going to grade around the world in the next months, I recomended your web site to the 36 and they are going to search for your services.
4	"I talked to Pavel Burian who helped me around any misunderstanding with the e-ticket. His support was very helpful.My questions solved were:1. I booked two connected flights, but it is not clear from the e-ticket whether the baggage is transferred by the personell or by the passenger (Should be noted somewhere on the ticket!). Yes they do that!2. Also misleading was the (more or less general) information on the e-ticket about ""identifying with the credit card"" since the passenger and credit card holder can be different persons. But it seems not neccesary in my case...Summarizing, the chat heals some problems not yet solved by Kiwi, but it is a young enterprise and (hopefully) the booking itself works fine."
1	Kiwi is a scam booking site.  Payment was taken from me and then they started demanding more money.  I booked two tickets and they refuse to cancel them.  All they want is more money.  Perfect example of bait and switch SCAM WEBSITE.
5	Best way to look for the cheapest flights - the only service that actually thought of how people think about travelling and how they pick their dates, times, durations, destinations... I love it.And the service is very good, personal, fast. Especially Matěj F. with whom I was in contact recently.Thanks for this great product!
5	Michael was an awesome help. He said that answering our question may take 24 hours and he got back to us within a 1/2 hour with an in depth response. Really happy that we were able to use kiwi for both our outgoing and return flights!
4	The customer service is fast and very helpful!The refund department is very slow though.I recommend using Skypicker anyway :)
5	Very reasonable prices and great service , will be using Skypicker from now on !
5	I was in such a hurry and Kira was so helpful. She was so quick and kind on my inquiries. I am so thankful for your good service.
5	The booking process was simple and the prices were quite low. I ended up having to add a checked bag after booking, but I wanted to be sure that the price was for both legs of the itinerary. The live chat was simple to use, and before long Jonathan had me sorted out.Looking forward to my flights!
4	First time experience with SKYPICKER was awesome.
5	Book my family air ticket here and was hassle free and fast. Thank you very much for your great help in updating my son's birthdate which i keyed  in wrongly.  Serviced was fast and I appreciated it much.Book again next journey!
5	Well organized! A Hotline which can actually be reached, very friendly, helpful and  staff.Promptly dealt with query and came back to me asap.Thanks, Samuel!Thanks Nikola.
5	I was unsure if my ticket also covered food and allocated seats.My question on the chat line was answered immediate and was extremely helpful and informative.  In a few minutes I had booked my seats, my food and put my mind at rest for a great journey.Thank you.
4	So far, I'm satisfied with kiwi's services and its phone assistance. Thanks Leonardo!
4	I recently had to contact Kiwi to discuss adding more luggage allowance to my booking and had really professional assistance by a very warm young lady by the name of Barbara. I was quite impressed by the honesty with which she handled things and most of all the fact that she delivered on her promise. I just also have to say, I like to travel and kiwi's deals just do such a good job at getting me to places at very affordable rates.
5	Thanks a lot Rodon, you are great customer representative... You saved our day...
5	Very fast and very helpful. I got so much help from Tomáš Mužík. He was with me all the time and helped me as much as he could. I made a mistake when i was ordering, but he helped me fix that even thought it was too late. Im really happy with the live chat because it is very helpful. Thank you so much.
4	I lost my connection from FLL to ATL due to the horrible immigration facilities at FLL. While Spirit, (the company operating my next flight) did not offer anything useful, Kiwi (Juan Costa and other two members) took care of the situation and re-booked me for a DL flight on the next day. The service was extremely fast, efficient and kind.Thanks!!!
5	you are very kind and very quickly, this is my best experience bying fligth tickets
5	thanks Skypicker for your service! got a quick response from your agent, Bek, who answered all my questions ! treating customers very nice! definitely 5 stars :)
5	Purchasing baggage online wasn't working, Lukas P. had it sorted out in a minute via chat. Thank so much!
1	Sadly I would never book with Skypicker/Kiwi again.We have booked a flight with Ryanair from Riga to Oslo and then from Oslo to Brussels. Ryanair changed the flight time, so that we could not reach the flight from Oslo to Brussles. <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> failed to inform us about this schedule change so that we landed in Oslo and our Connection flight to Brussels was already gone. On the phone they were trying to help us, but were unable to find a flight so that we could only get on a plane to Brussels the next afternoon. They assured us that it was their mistake and that they failed to send us the email about the schedule change. They also told us that they will cover the Transport and Hotel costs that we got because of their mistake. Once home we immediatley send them all the receipts that we had to get a refund for our costs. We did send them two emails with the bank details, but did not get our money back. After making another call they said that they did not receive the bank details and therefore could not give us the refund. Once receivig the refund we saw that they have only covered half of the costs that we have had. After asking again they told us that they only cover 50€ for the hotel and also that it has been our fault that we have been in Oslo for that long (on the phone they said that they have failed to send us an email) and that it was nice of them to still cover the costs for the extra flight and that we should be happy to at least get something.
4	Impossible to insert documents data for on line check in on the web site and it can be a real problem when you are abroad. Fortunately we have found Miroslava P on chat assistance and she really supported us and help to get boarding passes.We really suggest to use the in line chat for any assistance.
4	"Overall a almost ""top dollar"" first time experience with Skypicker.For our next trip we will, if all needs are meet, use Skypicker."
5	Puput from Kiwi was extremely helpful when we had forgotten the deadline for providing the travel document information.
5	Very satisfied with the support i received! Just one quick phone call and with the help of (the amazing) Eleonora, my problem was fixed in no time! Thanks for the great help!
2	A startup that finds 'hidden' discount flight tickets just launched in the US <https://t.co/i4xa4CyY8y> <https://t.co/8svvKS7tQO>
5	I just want to thank Lucie Obryan for taking the time to help me. Lucie helped me get out of a tough situation, because I forgot to enter my passport information online and was due to leave in a few hours. This mistake was going to cost me about 200 euros. I was about to cry upon finding this out. Lucie was able to override the system and put my passport information in. Extremely great company and great customer service. Lucie really made my day and was so amazing and kind and understanding. I am very impressed with this company and highly recommend.
5	Best price on the market, clearest and simplest website, and excellent customer service (I wanted to add luggage after I made my booking). The operator happened to be more reactive than I was on the chat :)Thank you Aurelija!
5	I was travelling in the days before my trip with SkyPicker and was unable to get at a computer to enter my passport details so that they could check me in. I contacted customer support at midnight before the day of departure, and Jonathan sorted this out for me and emailed me my boarding passes within half an hour. Excellent service -- I am really impressed.I will definitely be using SkyPicker again.
5	Booked 4 flights, had my tickets sent via mail (tickets from the companies, so not issues while checking in). Queried the support team twice about how to add an extra luggage, they were kind and very responsive.
5	Neil helped me a lot today with my booking! Thanks to him I will have a good journey home!
1	@skypicker 30EUR = £10 between 2 ppl. Spent £112 on flight we can't get. can't use voucher cos we away 4 when its valid. #skypicker #crap
5	I had a several destination flight combination booked via skypicker in south-east-asia. Whenever I needed support the team was available via online chat which made it easy to request support from abroad with no additional roaming/telephone costs - I totally enjoyed the experience, thanks to the team!
5	I was stressing out as I entered the wrong passport number when checking in. The chat customer service was excellent, quick and very helpful, they sorted it out in literally two minutes with no extra fees like some other companies do when you need to change your passport number. Thanks once again David!
5	Thanks to Skypicker our trip to India turned out both cheap and safe, and we had absolutely no problems at any airports concerning our tickets/luggage.The planes were comfortable, and what one plane could offer in more modern seats, the others made up for with delicious meals!
4	Super
1	I booked for 2 people. I have tried to cancel the flight because my dad's health problem. How come they get all the money even if i told them a month ago to take the flight??? It is CHEAT!! Should be refunded even some part of the money. You are cheating people. STOP IT! So still i have the tickets. I can not do anything for the tickets but just get rid of them. How come??Let's sue them. I think what they are doing is definitely OFFENSE!You can not go long that way!
4	Had 2 great deals with Kiwi and very happy with the services so far. There's just one minor setback, the security procedure. My first booking had a pending status for a few hours because of a security check needed to confirm that my card can be used. Afterwards I received a confirmation sms and e-mail which made me feel relieved, the itinerary was perfect and the booking number can be used in respective airline websites to manage my bookings. However, for my second booking using the exact same credit card, I received an e-mail that I need to call Customer Service and verify that it was my card. I got quite worried, but my call was picked up after waiting for ard 2-3 mins (considered quite good for a 24/7 customer service line) and Alexandra Y. verified my order and card. 2 hours later I received a confirmation e-mail. I guess as a feedback, these verifications were never required when I booked other flights online, so it surprised me when it happened. Normally, the booking site would require a One Time Password that's sent to my mobile to confirm, but if I'm not wrong, for both bookings, the website did not ask me for this kind of password. Would be a lot better if my next Kiwi booking I would not have to verify that I own my credit card. Nevertheless, the service was fast and good!
1	Beyond disgusted by my experience with <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com>! I will never be using them again and would strongly recommend others considering using their service to choose another. Because of miscommunication on their side I was forced to either pay through the roof for last minute baggage allowances on a sequence of flights or losing my bag. Unfortunately as a young traveller the hiked fees at the airport meant losing my bag! The reason I am so disgusted by the service is because I emailed them repeatedly for the better part of a week to confirm I had baggage allowance - each time being told I did, even though my emails stated otherwise. This could have been avoided had they done their job. The purpose of booking through a site like this is to save money, time, and hassle; from my experience choosing this service company destroys all three!
5	Thank you Lucie F. For your prompt action and for solving our late registration ,  thanks for your professional approach!!
3	Skypicker offers flights for up to 90 percent less with a cloud-based ticketing portal <https://t.co/sHl29oDJb4> <https://t.co/PVPbtUjXVW>
5	@kiwicom247 Thank you! Going with you on February to Brussel. Then planning Goteborg and Tokio will come on July... :) #czechpower
5	Great support, best of the best. Thank you Natalia and Nina, you are talented agents. My issue was resolved in less than an hour. Everything was well explained and executed. Thank you.
5	There's always someone available to help you via a live chat. One of their agents named Radek just helped me with a concern I had. I like their service so much, I booked my return flight with them as well.
5	I am really satisfied with <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>'s chat. Patrik, one of consultants, helped me with adding bags only to one airline to reservation of connecting flight. He was very professional, pleasent and full understanding. Also, he stayed on chat while I was doing a payment, answered all my questions and clarify my concerns.
5	it is my silly mistake that i booked a wrong time flight.i am so panic because i have my payment done by cc.However a customer service Mr/Ms Stanislav manage to cancel my payment right on the moment, he/she is very patient and professional for handling a panicking client like me.Although i did cancel the booking, but i would very love to make a booking again with kiwi !nice service !
5	"Thanks for help. And ""smileys"", they are fun ;) First time I got to Kiwi was Skypicker, I still digit that to link on it, kind of like it better somehow - but could be just my nostalgic tendencies.- I have to say I really like the way you connect to the public and the ""still-human"" personal dimension you kept in this ""virtual buisness"" togheter with the simplicity of access so that really anyone ""can do it"" and travel on a low budget finding the best connections without getting crazy plus having to spend ages to check in them one by one. And even someone who after all that cannot find a check-in box can have it all done in secs without feeling stupid but instead having someone nice on chat, right Miroslav? :) Cheers mate!"
4	First time travelling with Kiwi. Flights booked several months ago and I wanted to print out my return boarding passes before I left, as I won't have easy access to a printer while travelling. Used the livechat feature on their page. All agents I was in contact with were eager to help, but special shout out to Daniel Horak, Mario Zarsky, Kate and Alijica, all of whom made genuine efforts to assist me with this. Thanks.
5	I would like to say a huge thank you to Jolana who assisted me on live chat tonight. After i mistakenly booked a flight on the wrong day i panicked and began a live chat. Jolana was calm, kind and professional. She tried to direct me to cancel my flight but it was too late. she then offered to talk to her supervisor to see what could be done. It was stressful waiting but she was kind and reassuring, clearly explaining what was going on and reassuring me she would try her best. In the end she got my flight cancelled and a full refund.  I truly hope she gets a pay rise. Thank you so much Jolana! Warm regards, Cara
5	The platform really helps me get a cheap ticket to anywhere else based on my preference. Just choose the date you want to travel and they will tell you where is the nearest airport you could depart to a certain destination with a reasonable price. Unfortunately, something was wrong with their system and a lot of people are taking advantage and really proud to do that; which is completely unethical from human-being perspective. I understand customer want to get a cheap product with high value, but this is not the way it should be. I hope that Kiwi could solve this problem without making the company losing so much money because of the hedonism and greed of the customer who take advantage on such a really great system. Good luck!
2	I booked a flight for my boss and his wife about a week before they were supposed to leave. One day before they were scheduled to leave, it was realized their return flight would have to be booked one day later. On the day they were scheduled to leave I contacted Kiwi, and they told me they could change the return flight for 88.30 EUR. I agreed to this, payed the cost, and they told me they would change the date.3 hours later Kiwi informed me this 88.30 EUR cost had changed to 481.30 EUR, and that I only had two options: pay the difference of 393 EUR, or keep the original flight and be refunded 88.30 EUR. My boss was already flying to his destination, I was leaving on a trip in less than an hour, and he needed the new return date. I ended up paying the difference, even though Kiwi told me 88.30 EUR is all I initially needed to pay for the flight change.After returning from our trips, I contacted Kiwi to clarify this with them. After long, drawn out conversations, I was told they could do nothing because I had already paid their extra 393 EUR.As far as I am concerned, Kiwi did not honour their initial agreement of a charge of only 88.30 EUR. I have all the emails to prove they agreed this price would change the flight.I do not recommend Kiwi and I plan on dealing with airlines directly from now on.
1	"We are very unsatisfied with Skypicker. We are still waiting for an airline refund from a flight in November. We had everything settled with the airline already, but Skypicker told us that they would have to conduct the refund. Since then literally nothing has happened except for emails such as ""we are investigating the matter"". We would and will never book with Skypicker again"
4	I had the lucky to schedule my voyage to another country without being so concerned if there was any problems that could make me stay on land. It was my first time travelling alone, and I must say that I will not stop!
1	Do NOT BOOK through Skypicker, you will save yourself a lot of money and headache. This company is NOT taking RESPONSIBILITY for anything. Is much better to BUY tickets DIRECTLY through AIRLINES. We asked for a flight change just a few hours after we book it and skypicker said they will refund any fee. Afterwards they said its not possible and we have to pay unbelievable 500 later on 305 eur for changing the flight.The same flight we asked for costs that day around 130 eur.THROUGH RYANAIR you can change your flight within 24 hours without any fee but if you buy ticket through SKY picker you have to pay unbelievable high fees.  They call it all MISUNDERSTANDING but it was just loosing our time and money. It`s just good SEARCHING ENGINE!
5	Miro was very helpfull in the live chat.
3	Comments about skypicker, would you recommend them? via #travel #tourism <https://t.co/brRc8RsVJK>
5	It was great and i got answers for my questions really fast!They were really nice to me!
5	I booked a flight via <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> for an awsome price. Unfortunately my planes changed 1 day before departure so I contacted <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> via live chat. They did a perfect job as they offered me different options to choose an alternative flight and made it fast and easy for me. Thank you Monika Kobylkova for this amazing service via live chat
5	Very fast and helpful service. Stuff is very friendly. perfect!
5	If you travel with multiple stops choose <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>. They are the best.
5	Marvellous….saved me a fortune last year and about to do the same again. YES!!!!
4	1 - first contact - very nice app, not difficult to obtain invoice2 - to checkin - the hell. to much complicated to reach the boarding card. passbook not allowed3 - after 3 previous contavts Me Emre was great to find, in an acceptable time, a final solution. thanks Emre
5	I have booked four tickets with this company and simply because how easy it is to use their website and pricing
5	The booking process was easy going with all the necessary information given. Then several emails received reminding the trip and chekin. The only remark is that I did not get a proper invoice (probably my mistake?)
3	I bought the ticket two days before my day of departure and something weird happened. The airline could not find my name under the registration. They had a different name under that same reservation. I called Kiwi and told me to buy a new ticket and they would refund the money. I still havent done it so I hope they actually do refund the money. Any one know where I can send in the receipt?
4	MARTIN CARTER was very helpful, answered all my questions. Thank you ! He is great !
4	Honestly I think that Skypicker does a great job.  They have a friendly and helpful phone team who go out of their way to help and now that I have used them once and understand how things work, I would use them every time.  Misunderstanding timeframes of booking meals and extra bags caused me a little stress but the team helped me through and next time i will be good to go.  Their prices are the best and their service is a pleasure.Thank you Skypicker!!
5	I had help from Filip, who was quick to solve my problem on the spot.Quite easy and nice.
5	Michaela was very helpful and answered clearly all of my questions for my booking. Each time I travel I choose Skypicker as they have lived up my expectations and made my booking flights an easy task.
5	I'm happy to seize the airline kiwi and deal more pleased Mr. Mohammed beautiful and great interest in solving the problems of the private Thank you and thanks to Professor Muhammad:kissing_heart:
5	Erik, thank you for all! You were really nice to me and you solve my problem really quickly! Thank you for it all again!I recommend everyone to use <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com>
1	Our first flight was cancelled, kiwi promised to find an alternative but they proposed something only after 7 hours!! And there were many flights available.. at the end we had to make part of our trip by train but they refused to rembourse all the train ticket ( and they had promised they will). Terrible and arrogant aervice, never again!!
5	Not easy to use on internet, but I got help from their chat service with Julia, and problem was solve in few minutes.Thanks Julia
4	Overall a satisfying experiencing booking through skypicker and with no hidden fees!The only issue I had was not knowing whether or not I needed to check myself into my flights as I was told I would receive my boarding passes prior to my flight - but not receive them until on the day of the flight ! as a result I did check into 2 out of 3 of my flights out of fear I wasnt going to be booked in !
1	I booked flight tickets (booking no. 590421) on Skypicker yesterday night, 4th Feb at 10:37 pm. I got the date wrong and instead of selecting 6th March, I selected 2nd March. As soon I clicked on the payment button I realized my mistake and thought I will get the bank/payment gateway page which comes as a intermediate page from which I can go back instead of going ahead (note; this was my 1st experience with Skypicker). But here Skypicker uses an international payment gateway with no 2nd level of authentication and I directly got the payment confirmation page. Instantly I chose live chat option and wrote to the representative that I want to change the date of travel but I got the response of visiting the FAQ section of website. After this I called twice the customer care personnel and both told me they will check with the Air Asia Airlines and let me know in few hours but I didn't get a response yet. In manage my booking, when I try to change the date of journey it asks me to make payment of Rs. 15320 when the airlines charge you only a few thousands for doing so. Also, cost of booking a new ticket for 6th March with same flight no.s and schedule is only Rs. 11136 (14924 including baggage charges). If a resolution is not given to asap, I will be writing to Air Asia informing about the unfair practices of Skypicker and take it up in Consumer forum as well. So far my experience with Skypicker has been very disappointing.
2	This is my first time booking with Kiwi and I discovered after I purchased an international ticket that I have no way of selecting a seat before the day of my flight at the airport. I have never encountered a flight aggregator before where I can't go to the airline's site after my purchase, enter my confirmation number, and select seats. Now, because Kiwi is making me wait until the few hours before the flight, I will likely have little choice of where I sit and end up in one of the worst seats for an 8+ hour flight. I called their customer service who told me to go the Manage Booking page for my reservations and select whether I wanted a window, aisle or emergency row seat. I did this but then got an email that they couldn't select a seat, with no explanation of why. Very frustrating. I think I may have saved a few dollars by booking with Kiwi but this is not worth it and I would cancel my flight and book directly with the airline if I could now.

5	Great experience using the live chat. One of my flights was changed and Maria on the live chat really help me out and got me a perfect solution.

1	The customer service is very poor.  There is always a lag in response (even form emails stating that they are experiencing high call volume and may not respond for days) with little regard to the time sensitivity of travel.  I challenged a charge for a double booking (with insurance) with little success from the customer service channels and the website.  I even offered some options with consideration to American regulations.  A customer service rep snootily stated that they are in the Czech Republic and did not need to know of such regulations.  Really?  Then why the vanity US phone number?  Ultimately I disputed the charge with my credit card and SkyJACKER waited until well after the travel date in question to respond.  I feel this was done out of spite (I had given them several weeks to respond so they had more than enough time).  At least if they were going to wait until after the ticket date passed, they could have offered me a credit with them for future travel.  Now I cannot work with the airline carrier nor have they credited me back.  This shows that they are unconcerned with the customer experience - only the money.  They don't realize that the companies that do the best build customer loyalty by providing exceptional service and then the money floods in.  I don't know about you, but I want to know that a company has my back, especially when travel to foreign destinations is involved.  Shame on them.
1	Such a bed service!! I unfortunately booked flight with Kiwi. At the beginning the the cost for a baggage was 29 euro but I thought I did not need the baggage. Later on after I payed for my tickets I realised that I will need a checked baggage. And guess what was the price for it? 93 euro!! And the customer service as always was very sorry but could not do anything!!! Never ever Kiwi again!!
5	it&#39;s good and fast service and also online support is very very helpful. For example Olga Muzychuk from support help me with online checkin and she gave me all information which I wanted.
5	My booking took longer than expected, but the little stress this caused should be blamed on my booking late. Called Skypicker after 8 hours without a booking confirmation, faced no waiting time, and the issue was quickly resolved. Happy it all worked out and will be flying to Hoi An in a few hours
5	I have been very pleased with the service you have provided me with. I was on a flight from Bratislava to Madrid and whenever I needed something from you it was all done very quickly and in a very professional way. I'd especially like to thank one of your customer service advisors called 'Nela', who's been very helpful. Finally, I'd always recommend Skypicker to any of my friends and family in the future.
4	I would like to thank Natalia in particular from the live chat as she re-checked baggage size for me and made sure I got it updated accordingly on the e tickets. She was really helpful and understood my queries perfectly.

5	A great service I got an answer for my request in 10 min !! Very good
4	Finally I got my confirmed bookings after a long period of waiting but I want to give credit to Martin Carter and Thomas Krivanek for a job well done. They have both rendered an excellence service in assisting me with my queries. They have answered and given me useful information about my bookings. Again, thank you very much!
5	Alan was very helpful in helping answer questions about International Travel.
5	I went through a number of flight booking websites, trying to find the best deal, as holiday season is always hectic. Skypicker indeed offered the lowest fair, not because it wasn't visible on the other sites, but because their own charges were much lower. In addition to that, filtering flights is extremely easy and fast, no waiting to load the results and unnecessary popups; the whole website, including the booking form is super easy and user friendly. I also felt safe having 24 hour customer support available, in addition to buyer's guarantee.
4	Thanks Aura, for helping me out with my boarding passes. Great service.
5	this is the best for me, the services are great, the workers are fantastic, very polite and patient especially mr Anas Dallal he was so patient with me on the phone and guided me through the entire process. i can say im more than pleased with his services and will recommend this to anyone anytime and anyday.
1	Me and my aunty booked 8 seats between us- I booked two a few hours before her. Everything went fine, according to plan, paid for the flights! 2 days later I got an email saying that there were technical problems and they couldn't put the flights through as there were no seats on the flight left. Fair enough, they said they were going to refund us within 24hours  but we have not got a refund and when I called they said it wouldn't be for 10 more days. Now even 3 days after I booked, the flights have gone up by 50 pounds? I called up customer services and asked if we could get moved to a different flight on the day or either side of the days for the same price before the price went up even more and got a very bored, unhelpful man on the other end who just tole me to visit there website and pay again? So i fork out again for flights..and then what if they are full and they give us our money back in ten days? buy another set of flights and wait to be refunded? Terrible customer service, shouldn't have taken the money without confirming there were seats.
5	I had a live chat with Martin Carter who helped me out! He was very polite, and was extremely efficient. I messed up my booking info, and he was able to correct everything extremely quickly. Thank you!
1	Airline would not let my family member board the plane. Talked with airline and kiwi customer service. I was assured a refund within 48 hours. Several weeks passed, no word from Kiwi. I contacted them several times for a refund. I  was told that I would be only refunded 21 euro from 487 dollars ticket. I ended them spending additional 900 dollars to send my family member home. Basically I ended up paying  1300 dollars economy class ticket. Never again.
5	I want to thank Giorgi, who helped me today a lot!  He was very fast and gentle
4	When I were about to board my plane to San Francisco, I got asked if I had a return ticket. Apparently, you're not allowed to board if you don't [say you] have it. My phone app and internet just stopped working, so rushing around, I finally got to borrow someones computer with [extremely slow] internet. Worried I wouldn't make the flight, I took the first choice I found, not noticing that Jul was selected, not Jun... This morning, I discovered my credit card was missing, and was about to get to the airport when I detected the wrong month. Luckily [the travel agent] Kiwi's live chat (w Daniel) was friendly and pretty fast, so we were able to change the first flight in the itinerary to another one that I suggested. Although they charged 800 SEK extra originally, and the new flight that I found only cost 200 SEK more (not counting the 800 SEK), they charged 144 EUR (~1300 SEK) for the change (if I had done everything through Norwegian directly, it would have been free). When it comes to Norwegian, I would probably book with them directly next time. Nevertheless, Kiwi's site works pretty well and Daniel was very approachable. The overhead cost is justifiable for staff, site maintenance, buffer for airline changes and their seemingly good guarantees, so I'll keep them in mind for the future, especially for more advanced and group trips, as well as trips with airlines that don't offer as good service as Norwegian does by default. It would have been great if I just could've switched to the one I found on Norwegians site myself (no problem with accepting to lose Kiwi's guarantees in this case). Anyways, thanks for helping out, Daniel, hopefully on my way home tomorrow :)
1	I am very disappointed and would advise others to book directly with the airline or an agency with transparent refund policies. I recently made a booking and realized that there a transit in London which required me to wait in long immigration lines, take my luggage, go through customs and re-check it in for the second leg of an international journey. I decided that this was not a good option for me and wanted to choose a more convenient flight.I called Kiwi literally within 10 hours of my booking and requested for a cancellation and refund of my ticket. I had looked up the cancellation policies of each airline and Understood that each had a 24 hour refund policy minus the adminstrative fees. So i knew that i would not receive the exact amount i paid but would be refunded most of the fare. After going through back and forth with the kiwi customer support I was told that i would not receive my full refund due to over 200 euro in administrative fees. I asked for a full breakdown of all the costs associated with the administrative fees and was told that it was complicated to get the breakdown of costs. I pushed to find out why and was informed that kiwi does not always book the flights with the airline but in some cases uses a third party which adds more layers for the passenger and is not a good thing in cases like mine. I don't understand how administrative costs can be over 200 Euros when the flight was cancelled within 24 hours. All airlines involved have full refund policy and administrative fees not exceeding 20 Euros each. And if Kiwi adds an administrative fee of 20 Euros as advertised then the total administrative costs should not exceed 60 Euros!!! It has been over 10 days now and I have not received ANY refund or correspondence from Kiwi.
1	I booked a flight with a 30 hour duration. I know it is a long time,but it should start on a Saturday night, so I didn't have to take a vacation day on friday.Then there were two minor schedule changes, until the big boom. They decided that it would be reasonable to change it to a 54 hour duration. And it would start on 1 o'clock, a friday. So one more day vacation is lost, I had a lot of stress with my boss and in the end, skypicker did nothing.I get no refund, if I would like to cancel the flight I get 225 $ back instead of the 560 I paid.The only good thing in the end was some of the members in the Support Team, like Petr. He helped my with my further questions and calm me down a bit when I was in worry. (Because I will have 40 minutes to change the flight)
5	fast, polite, get things done quick5 stars
5	special thanks to Tomas that helped me find a great flight with a very positive attitude!
5	Perfect experience with <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com>! Especially, I would like to thank to Zbynek who helped me a lot when I was managing my booking and needed few changes. Everything was going fast and without any problems. I would definitely recommend <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> to others.
5	"Apart from the fact that, in my opinion, they have the best website for flight search, the company also has a very client-oriented policy. Everyone from the customer support team I've spoken to were very polite and professional. And their ""Kiwi guarantee"" policy is real! If one of your flights is changed or cancelled, they will keep proposing solutions to you until you find the one that suits you best."
1	"I can't even begin to explain how terrible the experience and service was (is) with this company.  Please, whatever you do, don't book anything through this site.  My flight got cancelled 30 hours ago and I'm still stuck in JFG airport with little hope of arriving to my original destination in Stockholm within 30 hours.  My entire family flies internationally regularly and no one we know has ever been stranded this long.  The company calls/emails every couple of hours with a new flight and by the time I get to the gate to check in, a different person calls with another flight even later.  Everyone is ""sorry"" but I don't think I'll get out of here without completely booking an entirely new flight on my own dime.  Please believe me and NEVER use this site !  I'm still stranded and there is nothing major going on regarding weather or anything else that can account for my situation.  I'll post again soon to let you know if I'm going to have to take of a residence in New York!"
5	My agent, Igor Guzvinec, was incredibly helpful and informative. Would definitely recommend using this company!
2	The @skypickercom's search is very powerful but the service itself &airlines could be quite painful and expensive. No control=Bad experience
5	Ali is amazing, and very helpful, he stayed on the phone with me , and return back call to sort my problems. I'm very pleased with his service, thank you so much Ali .
5	I had booked some flights from Kuala Lumpur - Sandakan - Kota Kinabalu - Kuala Lumpur and some changes were done to my last flight that was unfortunate regarding departure time.I contacted Skypicker and within the day i had bookings on an earlier flight.A very pleasent and efficient customer service - recommendable.
5	My friend and I are going on a 3 month backpacking trip through Europe, and right off the bat our first flight was delayed 4 hours, which was going to make us miss our connecting flights. Kiwi found us an alternative route that landed on the same day at no cost to us. Not only that, but since the new itinerary had us unexpectedly  staying in Boston overnight, they offered to pay for our accommodations. They seriously saved us, we would have been screwed without them.
1	I found out it was cheaper and more secure actually ordering straight through the airlines, after wasting around 900 dollars on a oneway ticket that was going to take way longer to travel with and no guarantee of coordination between airlines if flights are delayed or of a refund of the ticket. So really its at ones own risk. Lesson learned. One could also say that one should've read the fineprint, but not doing so is human. I will tell people to avoid this service and similar services in the future. My fellow exchange students were already shocked at how much cheaper it was ordering roundway tickets through British Airlines for example. Good customer service doesn't make up for the lack of practicality and no promises of a full refund. There is no need for feedback; but I know you guys are going to try to defend the case anyways, as it is a reputation thing. Advice to people reading this review: spend the extra minute looking for cheap tickets through airline services yourself (BA, AA, Lufthansa, KLM, United Airlines, Scandinavian Airlines, etc), not only is there a sense of accomplishment, but you will not regret it in the end. Thank you for the excellent customer service though.Sincerely, Dillon
4	We are experiencing delay in receipt of emails. Our phone issues are now resolved. Please contact us via phone and live chat. Skypicker team
5	The attetion from Enri  was more than ok,  they really assist you and help you with all your questions
4	To conclude : I am quite satisfied of Skypicker service.They were always there when I needed.Their spoken english is perfect.Sure I might use their services again.
5	Barbara helped when my bank did not tranfer the payment, in the end I got the flight even a bit chepaer because of their constant checking of the prices! I will book again with kiwi.
1	I booked Peach air through Skypicker on the 7th of November , going from Korea to Japan.But I want to change my travel schedule , so I asked for cancel the flight schedule on same day.And chatting with your online chat service.Unfortunately they told me the airline was closed during the weekend so you have to wait until the Monday.It was very uncomfortably answer but I could understand that.Because we booked on Saturday..So I kept requested for cancellation during the weekend.Today is Wednesday!!!! Wednesday!!!! 11th November.Already passed 4 days from asked for cancellation , and 2 days from Monday..I still could not receive any answer!!!I still do not know everything the flight cancellation process.They still told me just wait for them.I payed by our credit card. But we still don't know it confirmed or not.And We want to change our travel schedule. But we cannot do anything because we don't know  anything.Please let me know how is going the cancellation process step by step.I really don't understand this process and system at all..Your service team keep saying to me just wait.. until when?

JE VOUS LAISSE DEVINER OU METTRE VOTRE CARTE BANCAIRE POUR PAYER VOTRE REPAS!!!
5	booked via Kiwi for the first time so nervous but spoke to Filip who assured me I would get my boarding pass and confirmed my flight was booked ok.  Very important as I am starting a new job so will let you know if it does.
4	Thank you Olga, you were very helpful this morning, and we are looking forward to our trip.
1	"Kiwi is easily the already place I have ever used to book tickets.First of all, if you have multiple tickets, even if with the same airline, they are NOT considered the same trip. So flying to multiple airports, I have had to reclaim my luggage, get me tickets, AND wait through security at every airport, even during short layovers. But I thought, ""hey, I guess if it saves me money . . ."" I was dead wrong.First my flight was cancelled, which wasn't their fault. But it was the first out of the flights I was too take to get home, so I was really worried.On their website it says they will work to change to another flight, which they did. I was very relieved, because they were changing my entire itinerary since my first flight was cancelled. Unfortunately, when I asked for them to confirm with me on a certain flight, they just booked it. And it was a flight I could not make.I did NOT want them to book me a certain flight, because I knew I would miss it, and they did.I called to talk to them about this, and they said there was nothing they could do, that they had already helped me, and that I should stop calling them or  I would miss my flight. When I explained the situation they were NOT accommodating, but kept telling me that it wasn't their fault and that I ""should have known.""When I explained my frustration, they repeated the same lines I'm sure they're taught to ease tension over and over. ""We're trying to help you."" ""We have already helped you."" ""I understand."" It felt like talking to a machine, because they all used the same lines in the same tones and told me they were helping me, when in reality I have had to spend over $1,000 to get a NEW set of flights because their ""help"" means helping only investors. They also sent me a VERY unprofessional email saying, in part, ""You knew the time of the flight. You knew how long will it take you to get there.""Look, I get that it's a business and that buying a flight to make up for one that was cancelled is expensive. But at least be honest about it instead of feeding me the same lines while claiming to help.In my 29 years, I have NEVER felt so frustrated with an air travel company, and I will NEVER book through Kiwi again.I'm sure I'm going to get some response message to this like, ""We're sorry you had a bad trip. We'll look into it for you."" I don't trust them, and neither should anyone else. They put profits WAAAAY before customer service, which unfortunately means they will be losing any further profits they could've made from me or anyone in my family as a customer."

1	We have never before experienced such bad service as we did with Kiwi!We booked a flight through Kiwi in January and everything seemed to be okay.My boyfriend and I were going to Kos, Greece, from Copenhagen, Denmark, with RyanAir and Norwegian and we had to stop in Rome, Italy, on our way down there and Kaunas, Lithuania, on our way home.Kiwi promised us that they were going to check us in with RyanAir and send us the tickets online because we couldn't do so at the airport - but they never did! Therefore, we had to check in manually at the airport in Rome with RyanAir, which turned out to cost 90 euros! Money that Kiwi didn't want to give us back, even though it was clearly their mistake. This scenario could have been avoided if the guy we called from Kiwi 3 hours before departure in Rome would have hurried up and checked us in. (We couldn't do so ourselves because we needed either the e-mail or the last 4 digits from the payment card, which was managed by Kiwi, and Kiwi, strangely, wouldn't inform us about any of that. Those little details could've saved us 90 euros which is a lot of money, especially for two students like us. Kiwi claimed that we chose manual check in with the RyanAir flight, which is totally ridiculous because RyanAir only offers low fare tickets because of their online check in - in any other hand you will have to pay 45 euro per ticket for manuel check in!)Luckily Kiwi DID check us in with RyanAir at our way home AFTER my mom at home (since we didn't want to get our holiday ruined because of battles with Kiwi) called Kiwi several times. It was not easy for her to get them to check us in though. When we arrived to the plane, Kiwi, of course, hadn't seated us together, but me at the front of the plane and my boyfriend all the way in the back.I could honestly write so much more, like how I called Kiwi to confirm our luggage weight (which was incorrect - it said 6 kg on Kiwi's e-mail, but it was actually 10 kg) several times and they promised to get back to me with an answer - they never did, so I had to figure it out myself.They have broken so many promises, and the connection over the phone was poor and the communication/english was also extremely bad.All in all we will NEVER book flights through Kiwi anymore and we won't recommend the company to anyone!!
5	"I was recommended to use <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> by a friend. He said ""Whatever happens the customer service will help"". I said ""it doesn't matter :grin:. But accidently I wrote my own name wrongly :joy: So I had to talk to the customer service ;) and here is the surprise I got new tickets within 15 min! You guys are awesome. Thanks for the great help Lilya & Marek :)"
1	They took me ONE Hour to wait the chat room to deal with my problem of luggage. A very bad service and experience. My recommendation is that sending them email is faster then waiting that bad online chat room.
5	I want to thank Tanya for the way of solving my check in problem, the fastest ever!! thanks a lot!!!
5	Had to reschedule my flight and needed to have multiple calls with the support team of Kiwi, and the interacting team was Fabulous at all times. Special mention of Kristyna, Andy and Vika is much deserved in terms of handling the queries. Kristyna had really fast turn around and completely sorted all my problems. So thank you ladies. Much appreciated.
5	fast response and commited employeMarcel Strublik
1	@skypickercom yes - I expected near real-time - as other sites do for such simple itinerary; you promised 30mins in email and took 1.5hrs :(
5	I booked 2 return tickets from Stockholm to Budapest and forgot that my sister added a lastname after her wedding, thus having 2 lastnames. When skypicker asked for the passport numbers in order to check in the passengers (Thus far skypicker is the only travel agency that has ever offered me that service) they noticed that the name in the passport didn't correspond to the name on the ticket. Michael Angelo (customer service) offered to fix this for us, called the airline and took no extra charge for that.Everything was smooth and effortless, i strongly recommend! And Michael Angelo, you rock!! :D
5	Tom jurik made multiple attempts to contact me and make sure that I would be able to travel without his follow-through and commitment to his customers I may have gotten to the airport and not had a flight to get on. Great job.
5	I had an issue with my check in baggage payment not registering, only discovering this within 48 hours of my flights (cut off time to add check in baggage). With the help of a Kiwi agent named Olga I was able to rectify the situation quickly and easily, preventing the additional cost and stress of buying check in baggage at the airport.
5	James was very helpful in explaining the various baggage fees, merging confirmation numbers and making sure our surfboards made it onto our booking!  Thanks so much!
5	Jonathan was very helpful in amending my husbands tickets even though his shift had ended he didn't try to get rid of me he did the best he could to help me. The kind of customer service that will make you book with them again and again . Thank yiu very much
1	Never book with Skypicker, they put my partner and I in completely different seats and when I found out they asked me to pay more to fix their mistake!
5	Thanks Ondrai For the good help!
5	I had to use the live chat twice because I had a few questions as a first time user of this website. Their service was perfect. I spoke to 2 agents, I don't remember the name of the first one but he was very professional and friendly. Then I spoke with Zuzana who gave first class support. Thank you very much for everything. I'm very satisfied.
5	Fast and relieable online customer service when it's needed. Uncomplicated issue solving when problems occur. Friendly and helpful staff.
5	Booking procedure is very simple and efficient but I made a mistake when booking a flight ticket.Issis at Customer Service helped getting it all 'back on track' - she was very efficient and serviceminded
5	Spoke with Tomas from Customer service for over an hour, where he answered all of the questions that I had. He was very polite, knowledgeable, and gave excellent advice on how to find the best deals and cheapest flights. Highly Recommend!
5	All is okay nice service
3	Done skypicker ! Never again ! Fucking useless - have a nice day
5	Everything became apparent when I made a right decision to take off with you (<http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com>) - accurate information of flights and most friendly services that I have unexpectedly experienced. Also, I have no hesitations in particular to thank Martin Carter tirelessly supporting me with fruitful information related to my flight within less than 5 minutes. For sure, I will make my journey arrived in destination. Thank you!
5	I contacted Skypicker  online chat, where Daniela was very kind and quick to help me with my problem. Thank you!
5	Just booked a flight and wanted to know details about everything. Spoke to James, who patiently and quickly answered and explained anything and everything that came to mind. Great customer service online. Really appreciated it. Thank you James!
5	Excellent customer service. I would like to thank the fast response and sharpness in all details to help me.
5	Thanks for help.Great service!I recommend Sabina J ;)
5	Very pleased with pre-flight assistance and staff was very friendly. I spoke with Selorm yesterday and previously with other CSRs and they were very helpful!
5	"Surprised by fast and efficient support unlike all other companies.Thank to ""Puput"" a support staff member"
5	Thank you very much to Radek P, who helped me with my boarding pass. There was some technical problem, so I called for assistance. Radek helped me with everything and he was also very friendly. About few minutes after our communication was my boarding pass on my mail. He promised, that on Monday he will send me my boarding pass on return trip and he did.
5	Excellent and very helpful service from Ondrej Pohl. Thank you! Managed to modify our reservation immediately and without any further fees. Would recommned to anyone! Z.
5	In a hurry, as my flight leaves under 24h i got excellent service from Sena! She was quick and everything worked out fine!Appreciate!
5	It was the first time I ever used a company like this to book some plane tickets and I was a little weary at first... I sent an email with some questions on how to proceed for the check-in and the reply was super fast and always very helpful!I absolutely recommend this service. Keep up the good work!
5	I got quick answer and quick help, even if I did all in the last minute when it was supposed to be already late to add extra baggage, the guy helped me and did it, thanks to Emre T. for the great job!!
5	Had a nice conversation today with your agent Aliahan. He is very knowledgeable and his English is excellent
1	I booked a flight for my son to Germany on the 11th July. He now started a new job and can't fly until August. So I contacted <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> to cancel. I was told I could cancel but would not get refunded. But I could change the flight up to 48 hours before and may only have to pay the difference. So I checked the 22nd August and see it's the same price. £91! I was then told by <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> I need to change it on the website what I did until I came to the bit where I was being charged £92. <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> then told me they only know what I would be refunded for the flight after I bought the new flight. This smells dodgy to me so I got them to go back to the airline and to contact me the next day. In the morning I received the offer to change the flight for 109 Euros. That's  £92! So I started a chat on <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> again where I now was told that's what it costs to change. That's not true. That's the price of a new flight, not a changed flight. I guess if I would accept their offer they then will change the name on the first flight for £25 and sell it again.I asked for the details so I can deal with the airline myself but was refused!Hate writing teviews. But hate when companies con me.
5	Tomáš Jurík, your agent, has very considerably organised my much needed assistance for all my flights booked thru <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>. I am so grateful as I would not be able to travel without this assistance. Thank you so much.
5	This is my first time using Kiwi to book flight for my trip to Europe. I wish I knew about them from the start - as i would have booked all my flight through them! They are always there to assist you and the website is very easy to navigate. Emailing me my boarding passes and checking me in makes everything so easy. Puput and everyone else who has helped me on the Live chat have been phenomenal and I am so grateful.Thank you!
5	The website searches an easy to understand clear and user friendly list of dates and times suitable to your travel itenerary.The system even sends you links to check in on line if the necessary airline you travelling with requires you to do so before departure ensuring no extra charges are incurred at Airport.Highly recommend using Sky picker.
5	A lots of thanks to Minica! Excelent service - <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> Guarantee!

5	Great support received from Francesco Marra and Eleanora Congiu at the the time of the Brussels' attacks.Really impressed to receive immediate feedback from skypicker's assistants!!!Thanks indeed.
4	Petr is fast and accurate in providing information on my live chat with him. Thanks for the excellent support even at 12.50am. Though Kiwi promised a 24/7 support, we should give kudos to those working around the clock. =)
5	After a busy week we forgot to fill out the passport details for my wives flight. We got in contact with the online customer service, and Lucie G. helped me to fix the issue within minutes. Great service.

5	kiwi offered quick and reliable service.  no hidden costs
4	Needed some information about checked luggage rules so I used the online chat. It was very prompt and Arsen Jomardyan was super helpful :)
5	I got the e-ticket on time, when there was a change in times I got a SMS and when colled srevice I a representative answered quiqly and asked if I approve thr changes and then got a new e-ticket.The connection was good. the only problem was that each flight was deleyed between 0.5-1 hr. Good thing I wasn't in a hurry.
1	"I wrote another review which I have now deleted because of my further experience with this company. I was due to fly on the 2nd of January, and had received an email indicating I was to receive my boarding passes on the 30th of December. My journey consist of three separate flights, with three different airlines as far as I know, so I was happy to know I would get all my paperwork printed out before departure. However even though an agent assured me I was due my second boarding pass, this was never sent to me and now shortly before I leave I am told I cannot get the boarding pass up front. Furthermore the agent I spoke to about this, tried to reason with me in stead of answering my questions. And had the nerve to say ""Well..."" to my concern that I might not be able to make my connection if I am supposed to check out and go through check in and security again.And all this with extremely short notice. I will not be booking anything from this company again."
5	I had problems with learning how to use <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> website, in the degree that i wasn't able to add my passport number on the page to have my boarding pass hustle taken care of on my behalf. I was probably too late with it now, but i contacted one of your excellent customer service workers named Pavel, and it didn't take him more than a minute to get me set up with it. Clear-cut service and i'm very happy. Five outta five and a high five on top. Cheers!
4	thank you for the great prices and service. special thanks to Kira for the special support
5	thanks for a nice servers I got from you today when I asked about my trip, it was very nice response from the seller called Sirhii or if I've written right Sirhaa
5	Do you allow work from home? I live in Ostrava, have great skills/ experience  from 18+years in the US.
5	Maria thank you for your help.  I  really appreciate it...  Thank you
5	When i try change my baggy for difrent they doing everything to help me :-)
5	Denis Ilyin Is the man, we had difficulties to get boarding passes but Mr Denis Ilyingave us peace of mind. Now everything is under control, exept my wife
5	Polite and very helpful customer representatives.. Thanks babak!
4	Thanks Guys,Had a great experience with the on-line chat option. I got really quick helpful responses from the Team.
5	Dear Tomas,Thank you for excellent services. This travel really help you for the trip. They will reminder you by  your phone message. Then you can chat directly in chat live. Then they response very quickly. Thank you.Fitria
5	I contacted <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> via Live chat because of the check-in system that was not suitable with my Android phone. I was very frustrated as I thought I need to pay to do this at the airport but luckily Kristina at the Live chat was very helpful and was able to check me in. It really made my day!!
5	I had questions regarding my upcoming flight in Japan, and went on the chat service on Skypicker. Got excellent help from Enri A. He answered immediately and was really helpful. Great service!
5	Nina helped me very quickly and I didn#t have the feeling to be left alone with my problem.
5	This service was awesome!!! They handled every question I had perfectly
5	Kiwi did a great job helping me to solve problems that occurred. The customer service was always friendly and willing to help and came up with great solutions.
5	Skypicker is the most satisfying service provider. It only took a few minutes to book the flight and receive the itineraries. Definitely offered the lowest price. I will keep using and recommend Skypicker to every traveller I know.  Thanks for the excellent service.
5	The agent understod my query very well in the first go and responded accurately. Agent had complete knowledge of the process and flights.Excellent !!!
1	KIWI  -  It is a scam company!!!   - they offer Flight Insurance and then just run away from it - horrible customer service!!!!   no phone to contact them, unable to talk to anyone over the phone - ARE GIVING A CALL BACK IN A fake PHONE NUMBER THAT IT IS NOT RECOGNIZED!!BE CAREFUL - DO NOT USE KIWI
5	I've found Kiwi when couldn't directly buy Colombian internal flights with European cards (local air companies refuse such transactions). They offered flights from all Colombian air companies, so I could choose most suitable ones.I bought 4 flights in total via Kiwi, all transactions went smoothly, payment was quick. Their surcharge on tickets was very moderate. I got tickets quickly and later they made online check-in for me and sent me boarding passes.As there were no cancelled or delayed flights, I don't have any problem solving experience with Kiwi, so can't comment on customer service.
4	well organized team working in very professional and friendly manner.
5	We are a family of 7 and had to travel from Bangkok to krabi - and went online in our hotel! The tickets were easy to find and buy!! After purchase they arrived at your mail, with all the info on the airline we will be flying with ( luggage size and how many kg we each could travel with, etc ). 24 hours before our fligth - our boardingcards arrived without us doing nothing ( did not se this coming ), great service!!We will sure book our next fligth from your site and we will recomend our site to all.Thanks.Family SlothThailand.
5	This was my first time booking plane tickets online. Anastassia was very helpful, great service, will return back to you in the future!
1	not route changesalso not refund
1	We had to either change the departure date, departure location or cancel our booking some 6 days before our flight. First, we tried calling both the UK and Vietnam numbers listed on their website numerous times over a 24hr period and they were both constantly busy. We then sent them an email request, which they  responded to after a follow up email. The email said they would contact the airlines and get back to us. The following day, whilst we were waiting to hear back, we found their live chat link and used this to follow up on our request. The contact asked us to change our flight using their online service, which didn't work. Then she said she would get back to us to let us know what options were available to us, again. Her next response was to confirm, via email, we couldn't cancel the flight (some 4/5 days out???) and to let us know that the change of date can only happen with one leg of the journey, and by the way, she'd gone ahead and changed the flight and the new ticket will be sent out to us for the first half of the journey. We would have to buy another ticket for the second half, pay 80 euros for the change of date and not be reimbursed for any of the ticket price that we had previously paid. I then told them that was was not what we requested, we merely wanted options. We instructed them to please keep the original flight. All the time we were still trying to contact them via telephone to no avail. They then apologised for the misunderstanding, looked into our request and offered an alternative which would have cost us $500 plus the cost of our original ticket. This was obviously unacceptable, especially as it was still 3 days before the flight. They blamed the airlines for the lack of flexibility with these change requests. In my experience this has never been the case with any other airline or third party, that my wife and I have ever flown and we have both done extensive travelling. In the end our flight stayed the same and we made other arrangements. Our message to you is BEWARE: if you think there is any chance you will need to change your booking - reconsider using their service. They were hard to contact and not flexible with our requests compared to other 3rd party agents.
4	Good place to search for best prices. However, be advised if you must cancel or rebook you will deal directly with your airline, not with KIWI
5	I needed to change some information and couldn't find the right place to do it. Lilia quickly fixed it for me and sent me a confirmation email. Pretty happy with the service
5	I used Skypicker for the first time to travel home. I visited 4 countires on my way back to New Zealand and didn't have to worry about flights because I booked them all in one go on Skypicker. My airfare that included 4 countries was cheaper than flying one way to New Zealand. I was happy with how quick and easy it was to find resonable airfares with airlines I trust.Cheers Skypicker!
5	I had a delayed flight in Fort Lauderdale... Spirit Airlines... missed three connections and these guys sorted everything. Communication was difficult but it all eventually got done... get a 1-800 number ffs. Regardless, both Niel and Thomas made everything easy and quick and I'm on my way in no time at all. Standby prices with first class service. Thanks Guys!
5	I wanted to know if my flight was on schedule so I contacted kiwi and talked to Philip. He was very helpful and answered very quickly. I was very satisfied and I will book with kiwi again
5	Thak's a lot to you and to your support team Jan lukasek for quick and professional respond to my question. It was good and pleased expiriens to work with you!
5	I was happily surprised by how helpful and efficient the customer service chat was. I barely had to wait to get in contact with the person assisting me (Patrik Pivoda) and he was very helpful and made sure I got all the answers I was looking for. Good service -I will remember this for next time when I'm booking a flight and I would recommend <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> to friends and family after this experience.
4	James attended to me in what is a very difficult time and distressing situation. He was clear, concise and informative. I greatly appreciated his simple explanations and guidance. As well as sending best wishes to my mother who is unwell.
5	Miguel attended me very quickly today, I sent them an email and he answered me immediately solving my problem!
2	@skypickercom aren't we on 10th day? Please advise why did I need to pay +/-£16 to confirm payment whereas u already took the other amount?
5	The live chat service on Skypicker is great to use. The agent Daniela was very helpful answering questions I had about my checked baggage for my travel plans in June. I have two layovers before reaching my destination and wanted to follow up to make sure my checked bag cost was covered and ask if I could add a second checked bag. When I booked my trip initially the site would not let me add two checked bags. This is important since I am moving internationally. She informed me the best option is to contact skypicker back a few weeks before my flight with the bag weight so I can get a more accurate price estimate and add it to my travels. She was very pleasant to chat with and very informative with a few other questions I had. Hopefully my travels in June will go smoothly and I will write another review then.
5	Great phone customer service! Lucas H. saved the day with luggage issues. Very personable, quick to respond and empathetic!
1	@skypickercom worst experience ever. 2 hour layover equals strand at the airport and 2000 out of pocket. Never again
4	This is the first time I use Kiwi and im really appreciate they are kind support specially  The chat  with Ms Natala  for helping me to cancel my booking ... Thank you very much Jasim ... Dubai
5	Recently I had a great experience with the customer service.I had a 2 hour connection and my first flight was estimated late to take off for 3 hours, rendering the connection impossible.I contracted my insurance and the airline, both were not too helpful.Not having high hopes (as I didn't really think the agency would take any responsibility), I then contacted Kiwi who sold me the tickets.And, what a pleasant surprise, Kiwi figured out everything quickly, gave me another ticket for next day (direct instead of connection), and promised a compensation for the hotel under a certain (rather generous) limit.Thank you Kiwi team, Monika G. and Jana T.  in particular.Next time I see several agencies quoting similar rates on Skyscanner, I will opt for Kiwi.
1	Ridiculous company. Friend currently stuck at Calgary airport after they messed up. Took his payment but failed to pay Air Canada. Best they offer him - a flight tomorrow via Dallas and a 50 euro hotel voucher... Also telling him he has to pay for his snowboard which would have gone for free on his original booked Air Canada flight. Customer Service?? Zero.
4	I booked my flights and waited for the confirmation, as it did not come through as expected I contacted the live chat support. I managed to get through the bot pretty easily and was dealt with by Alan. There was no fuss and no messing and the typo in the email address was corrected in minutes. The conduct was polite and professional and considering I will be traveling in less than 24 hours after the booking I am very happy it was resolved quickly. I would have no problem using <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> again, Thanks Alan you are a credit to the field of employment that many people show little respect for.
1	Im moving from SJU to Dallas, and i made a reservation via skypicker with my 3 year old son.  First, they cancelled my ticket and did a new reservation without notice, so when I called spirit airlines to add bags, since I didnt found my reservation in <http://spirit.com|spirit.com>, they told me that my flight was cancelled for my first connection, but my second connection was still confirmed, and there was a note by skypicker that said that my credit card didnt work for the first connection. I called my credit card and the charges where there.  I had to figure out by a link that they sent me in one of the first emails that i had another confirmation number!The ticket has 1 connection to FLL, and they made 2 different reservations, meaning, that i had to get out of the plane in FLL, get my 4 bags with my baby, and my 2 extra bags, do the line for check in AGAIN, pay for the 4 bags AGAIN, to thru security check AGAIN and get in the plane for my final destination in 2 hours.  I called the UK number ( they dont have an advertised 1-800) and they tell me that i have plenty of time, and its not their fault that the airline was going to charge me for my 4 bags again, and its my fault that i chose a flight with a connection.  I travel a lot, and i do a lot of connections and this has never happened to me...but on the phone they're saying that there is no other way of doing reservations with connections, and if  I dont like it there are no refunds.  Im just calling my  credit card to cancel it and my new job will have to wait for me one more week since there are no flights for less than $700 this week vs the $150 i paid.
5	Sara assisted my check in process via the online chat portal and was a delight to deal with. She processed my request quickly and efficiently. Thank you Sara.
1	THE AIRLINE CANCELLED MY FLIGHT, I AM SUPPOSED TO LEAVE TOMORROW MORNING AND SKYPICKER HAS NOW ANSWER OR SOLUTION OR ALTERNATIVE FLIGHTS FOR ME, WHEN I HAVE ALREADY A RESERVATION IN MY DESTINATION AND NO PLACE TO STAY IN THE CURRENT CITY. AM I SUPPOSED TO ASSUME COSTS OF YOUR MISTAKES?????????????????????????
5	I received absolutely fantastic from Zuzana, she was more than helpful and resolved my problem very quickly. I was unable to check in online the day before my flight and she did it for me. It saved me having to pay potentially £45 + to do it at the airport. Thank you!
5	The Service of Skypicker and Miquel was perfect!
2	A startup that finds discount flight tickets 'hidden' on airline websites just ... - Business Insider <https://t.co/8ZWN579vi5>
5	"""I was quickly and smoothly guided through my issue by Lenka's help, and you can consider me a happy and satisfied customer due to Lenka's great skills and service.Thank you for your help!"""
4	I had an issue with my flight time as it was early in the am and there was a time difference. My customer service rep Anh Tran was extremely helpful and patient. Thank you!!
5	Irina was very kind helping me to solve a small issue.Great
4	I recently returned from the Caribbean on a flight booked through KIWI.  The journey required me to take to flights but unfortunately the first connecting flight of mny journey between St Lucia and Barbados was so severely delayed that I missed the connecting flight form Barbados to Manchester, UK.I called the KIWI customer support line and spoke to a Mr Theodore V, a travel consultant at KIWI.  I am very pleased to report that Mr Theodore V was very helpful, courteous and reliable.  He efficiently reorganised my travel plans and ensured he called me in the Caribbean promptly to inform me of any changes being made to my flights (thus ensuring I didn't have to pay for huge roaming costs on my mobile phone).Mr Theodore V was polite, professional and efficient - hugely appreciated.Kind regards,Stephen
5	I missed my flight due to a delay so I contacted kiwi immediately and they booked me two new flights the next day within two hours. They also gave me a €50 hotel voucher for the night stay in Ho Chi Minh. I will definitely be using this company again !!
4	I received many emails attaching the e-Ticket, where was said my boarding pass would be available the same day of departure but I received it after I sent you a couple of emails only 2 hours before the time I had to be at the airport. This added a lot of stress to the trip. For the flight back I have a similar problem. I was said the boarding pass would be available in 4 hours and I had not received it 24 hours later. The answer to my email was that there had been a mistake and the online check-in was not available for that flight. It could have meant we had arrived late, but fortunately we were on time.However, the searching engine is really good and eficient.
4	After calling about an issue I was quickly forwarded to customer support where Tomas Jurik helped me.  Kiwi and Tomas made the process easy and made sure I was taken care of. Thanks so much for your help!
5	I'm having problems with my reservation dates and I'm quite impressed with their customer service. I was kindly helped by Zuzana H., who took the time to explain everything to me and followed up on my queries promptly. Keep up the good work!
4	I had a a really helpful talk about my forgotten travel insurance with Katharina. She tried to help me with any question I had. Hopefully everything will be alright then.
5	A special thank to Tomáš Jurík for the assistance. Professional available and useful
5	Very helpful service by the <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> staff, especially Lukas and Thomas. They helped me with an error on my end the moment I contacted them without the need for any hassle. Will definitely be going through them again for any future flights
5	good, cheap, easy to find. if your program aint linked from the bottom to the top recommended to have a look on skypicker.
5	We had a wedding to attend in Manila on 31 Dec.  Getting a flight from Aust to Manila in this peak period for several people amounted to a lot of $$$$.  i stumbled on Skypicker, and was supprised to find return tickets from Perth to Manila for approx 50% less than name brand carriers. Needless to say...we booked.  Our tickets and boarding pass were emailed to us in a timely manner, and additional purchases such as meals and extra luggage weight were handled efficiently and promply.  SkyPicker....your  up  there  Bro - -My friends and i will be booking with you again and again...
4	having a really excellent experience with jonathan. he had been really helpful and response to my question in a blink of an eye. great job
5	I was helped by Alikhan on online chat. Alikhan was very very helpful on everything I asked and all the doubts I had. I never used Skypicker but after such a great and helpful chat I look forward to use this service more often. Thank you for the great service :)
5	I had to change a reservation to ensure I was home for my anniversary, I had problem with my credit card (which I use all the time @ Kiwi), the bank said not them and the technical guys at Kiwi as well, but for 75 minutes Lucie F. did not drop the chat and finally she found the issue, the transaction was done in Euros and it did not work, once she figured it our she changed for the right currency and it worked, thanks for your professionalism and patience! great customer service!
5	Thank you Luis Silva for kind and professional help with our booking with skypicker./Pia and Benny
5	The call the support was very easy and helpfull.
3	RT @saileshsays: #skypicker sold me a flight that ceased operating two months ago & didn't find an alternative or compensate! #shameful #av…
5	I had problems with the check in, so I decided to use 24/hr online help.Honestly I didn't expect it so effective, but I was wrong! Marius helped me and sent me the ticket so fastly! Thanks! :)
5	I sent a message to <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> because i had not received my confirmation email. It turns out i had misspelled the travel companion's name as well as made a typo in the email address. i spoke with Valentin who could not have been more professional, courteous and knowledgeable. He solved my issues in no time. I had never heard of <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> before. I am a first time user, but i guarantee this will not be my last. I am most impressed and recommend them highly - at least the reservation side. Thank you Valentin.
4	Great customer service by Lusine. Very patient, paid great attention to my problem and helped me really quick.
5	I had problem with login to my booking. Tamara answered on chat and helped me with my problem immediately.
4	my request was sorted very quickly, thank you very much!
5	"I received excellent customer service by ""Martin"" between 10:39 - 10:58 AM - when infromations from my booking needed changing."
5	Awesome online service. Many thanks for clearing up what I needed to know Margarita!
5	I missed an on-line check-in on their webside, Filip updated my info and I received my boarding pass within few minutes eventhough it was less than 24 hours before my flight. Thank you! :)
5	Thank you to great staff member Ondra! I was traveling through out Asia when a airport staff member told me there was a problem with my reservations. Being that I had no cell phone data in Asia I asked my dad to contact skypicker. He spoke to Ondra who was very patient and straightened everything out. (Even though now I think it was the airport staff that was giving me incorrect info) Thank you! Great customer service!
5	I just want to fill middle name and firstly one booking agent told me, that I have to pay 60,- EUR.I paied and then Pavel Burian made it for free.
5	I was served at online-chat with Michaela and Anna.They really helped me a lot. Thank you for your patience.:)
5	I realized that i have to check in online 72h before the flights(going from US to Europe through 5airports) not 48.I got in touch with Lucas P. on the <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> website Live Chat and after few minutes i had all the confirmation emails in my mail box!!!I wish all customer service agents could be so professional like Lucas P.Robert.
5	I talk to one Guy today, i really Love your service
5	its a pleasure to be travel with kiwi... there 24/7 care is very good. thank you Gana for all your help. and also the other people who helped me.
4	It was the first time I bought flights through <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> and it went really well. It was easy, fast and reliable. They managed the bookings very well, taking care of the boarding cards largely in advance, which was very convenient.
4	They do a very good job and they care about customers. Buying the tickets was very easy and they also took care of check-in. My trip back was suppose to be Dublin-Bruxelles - Bacau. Because of unexpected events that were not my fault I lost my connection in Bruxelles. Skypicker paid for a new ticket to get home and also for accommodation and a meal. Their assistance was great. Still, the new ticket they bought was not my best option, taking me in my home country but 550 km away from my original arrival point. It probably would have cost them too much comparing it with my original one. I agreed with this new arrival point to avoid another 2 nights delay. The refund for accommodation and meal was easy and quick. Considering the hole experience I will buy tickets form them again especially  if there is a connection involved :)
5	Logging into my Skypicker booking details and realizing that it was past the 72 hour mark of filling out passport information for me and my boyfriends upcoming trip got me really nervous. As there could be up to a $210 check in fee per person. I immediately opened the live chat and was greeted by one of their representatives, Eva. I explained our predicament and she was more then helpful with finding a solution. In less then ten minutes I was providing her with our passport details and was sent our boarding passes. I have never flown with Skypicker before but this was definitely a great first experience. We'll be booking through here again. Thanks for all the help Eva!
4	I had good experience with the service, Mario did the great job, he's really helpful:)
2	Booked a flight online via <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> on 15/01/2017.  Received text with booking reference confirming flight stating I'd receive an e-mail and...nothing since.   Tried calling the number stated for any difficulty being experienced on the text and...nothing; no option for my type of enquiry and stating to e-mail.    Logged in via their app to check 'my bookings' there again and...nothing.  Have struggled like billy-oh to find a direct e-mail for this mob and...you've guessed it, nothing.  Found an online service portal chat-type thing a couple of days ago.   My type of enquiry is listed so filled in the relevant sections with the required booking number and...nothing.Getting very annoyed...not least as this problem will be nigh on impossible to sort out in India when I'm there.  Would advise everyone of being very wary of booking with this company.
5	I was quite panicking due to some troubles with the reservations, flight changes and that, but Anna helped me a lot and in a few time got all the information I needed about my flights.Really good job done by her, if you need any help, ask for Anna!
5	Very helpful and quick to respond. Impeccable assistance. Thanks Aliz
5	This is a very good service
2	According to the skypicker representative Sara, Skypicker is a non-cancellable nor non-refundable company even though the website clearly states in their policy that they allow cancellations with refund. I couldn't believe what she said so I even took a screen shot of the conversation.
5	I talked to Eric and it was one of the best call center experiences in my life.Thank you
5	I had some questions and Jiří Červenka was super nice and helped me answer all of them. He was patient and kind to call all the airlines for the information I was requesting.I really like skypicker because you can find really cheap flights although there are flight that make you wait for a really long time.
5	I had a terrible experience with the airlines due to multiple cancellations, and the online chat representatives (Nina K. and Daria) were fantastic.  I really appreciated their quick responses and helpful attitude.I'm still waiting to hear back on a reimbursement request for travel costs incurred due to delays, but assuming they can honor them then I definitely would give Kiwi 5 stars all around.
5	Excellent service, both with reservation/payment and with check-in online service made by them in our name and sent in time to my email.Would definitely recommend SkyPicker to other people.Florin Matache & Miklos Csaszar
4	@skypickercom do you do affiliate marketing programs with bloggers? might be interested on it ;)
5	Aliaham Paris can be possible because of you!!Thanks for the support, you help me alot.Nice work!!
5	This is my first experience with Skypicker. After I payed my first reservation, I got an e-mail requesting to fill the document number. I filled in it with my passport number and sent it. But afterwhile a moment, I worried that I might type the wrong letter. So I wanted to check the passport number from the page, 'Manage my bookings', at the Skypicker. But I couldn't find the page to do it. So I texted with their online support team, and one of them told me to send an e-mail. Then I sent an e-mail asking them check my passport number and they checked it for me. it was helpful. :)
5	polite and helpful customer service
5	The best of all experience.  Thank you skypicker
3	I did have a bit of a problem at first trying to get allocated seats, but to be fair I had two different booking numbers, as my sister decided to join me at a week after I had booked. However had a live chat with Alex, who was a good help. Today received email from Kojo A, who had all my allocated seats, so I am a Happy Bunny.
5	Big thanks goes to Louis who helped me in changing nationality to passenger where i made a mistake in registration. Heep up a good service! Thank You!
5	I got connected to Lukas Janecka, he understood my question right away, answered very quickly and promptly.This is my first booking with <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> and I aam impressed with this online support.
5	I worked with Vally and he was very helpful. He understood my frustration and quickly worked to find me a replacement flight. I would definitely use <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> again for my next trip because I know they have my back if anything goes wrong.
5	I have used Skypicker many times now. Every time it has been excellent. The flights are substantially cheaper than other sights and it takes the hassle out of trying to figure out turnovers and transits myself.
5	"Martina the representative I talked to was Very Very Kind and Friendly. She gave me clear answers and I felt comfortable chatting. unlike the last representative that gave me vague and quite short responses like ""When the information is gathered"" when I asked ""Until when should i expect a response?"". She gave me clear numbers offered expected helps for me. I wish you all luck to have her as a representative when you use 'LiveChat'"
5	I put a wrong email address by mistake while booking my flight, and Alexandra from <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> helped me fix the problem in 5 minutes. I've never experienced such smooth online customer service before, in most cases I had to make phone calls and wait much longer.
5	Thanks Aura, great customer service!!
5	Made a mistake when booked tickets online but  Ms Hanka Ch was very helpful to contact with airline to solve the problem. Very smart lady with quick action.
5	I want to mention Mr. bogdan that help me so much to complete the order.he give me a nice present for my 50 burthday today.
2	@skypickercom I already bought tickets. But, I'm thinking about adding the travel insurance. Is it too late?
5	did all function
3	FIRST TIME BOOKING WITH <http://KIWI.COM|KIWI.COM>. EXCELLENT SERVICE. SWIFT AND HASSLE FREE FROM START TO FINISH. BOARDING PASSES AND E TICKETS ON TIME EVERYTIME. WOULD HAVE NO PROBLEM RECOMMENDING TO FRIENDS AND FAMILY AND WILL DEFINITELY BE AVAILING OF SERVICES AGAIN.BIG SHOUT OUT TO IGOR FOR ALL THE HELP.
5	He has be very helpful and patient of teaching me how to get to my booking. Very nice service!
5	I had no delays and everything was ok.
5	I am writing this review because I really thought Kiwi Live Chat is helpful service for people who has never used Kiwi/does not have enough time to read all the steps and etc. In addition to this, I would like to mention Petra Musilova, who were in charge of my Live Chat. I had an issue of my carrying luggage but she immediately solved my problem for my flight. However, thanks for her kind support, I did not feel any stress and easily solved the issue. She even suggested me for my second flight luggage solutions as well. I believe that customer service creates word of mouth and increase the reputation of one's company. And her work was excellent and would love to recommend Kiwi to people who are planning to travel. Online booking  sounds easy but very invisible and not sure if I am on the right track or not. At this moment, live chat, which can help out customer together at the same time is very helpful service. Thank you very much for your kind guidance Petra!!
5	best customer service I have encountered before. Thanks for everything Ivana Vlahović she is the best.!!
4	Vika was very nice and extremely helpful. I loved the service I receieved.
5	Miquel, very friendly and efficient solution to my problem, thank you very much
5	Me atendio muy amablemente resolvio mi problema y contesto todas mis dudas
1	I was buying 2 plane tickets from Oporto to Lisboa, and just after I put my credit card information, Kiwi’s page went down and appeared a message in the page saying: TRY AGAIN LATER, THE PAGE IS NOT WORKING WELL NOW. A few minutes later, I booked again, AS THE PAGE TOLD ME TO DO, and it worked normally. Then, I received 2 mails with 2 confirmations, so even the first booking that was never confirmed to me after I put my card information, was also charged. I can’t believe that Kiwi charged me 2 times even the page went down and THEY told me to try later. This is unacceptable, and now they doesn’t want to solve this situation. They told me that for them there wasn’t a page error so they will not do anything.I did everything as I was supposed to do and they are charging me 2 bookings even they told me to try again when the page went down. I will not accept that they don’t solve this problem that is not mine.
2	A startup that finds discount flight tickets 'hidden' on airline websites just launched in the US: I just book... <https://t.co/JcgJBqATzz>
5	We missen our flight so we had to book tickets for another flight very last minute. At first our credit Card was nog accepted, but this had nothing to do with the people of <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com>. We called several times and they answered always quickly and were extremely helpful. In the end we got our tickets and were very happy. I have never experienced such a good costumor service. We had 4 different people on the phone (including Eric) and they were all so friendly!
5	Igor was super helpful in helping my technologically-unsavvy self get the information I needed about my flight. Efficient, friendly, personable. Very grateful for the assistance.
5	I had reserved a two-legs low-cost flight from FCO to FES and my first flight was delayed by over one hour. I was worried about missing the second flight. the guys of the helpdesk did all that was in their power to make me be aware that there would be no trouble, that if I missed the second leg they would be there to find a solution, and they sent information about the alternatives, which fortunately were not needed.great job and great patience.

4	She took my stressful situation and made it almost seamless. Thank you Jana K. I had to call back and spoke to another Jana who was also very helpful.
5	Im so happy that the skypicker fixed the problem right away.. Thank u so much ..now we can  travel with smile thank u so much
5	I love the site since it gives you the combination of the cheapest flights available. This is somethign I used to do myself so it took me hours but with kiwi it s all automatic. Also, I love how they do the online check in for you and so on.. super efficient A+
5	I needed to change my flight, and on the website it said the same price as a new ticket. I contacted <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> thru their livechat and a very helpful person named Marketa helped me find a much cheaper choice. Their online service with booking is also very easy. Thanks to Kiwi!
2	I purchased tickets € 1,400. When I asked name change, Skypicker said fee will be € 728. Isn't it too expensive? Expedia had canceled and repurchased for nothing in same case. Sky picker, but said impossible. Hard to understand as a customer. (#794607)
5	I didn't manage to send my passport details in time, but a very helpful employee named Ahn answered me after a few second on the chat and solved the problem straight away. Thank you
5	I was verifying the different possibilities to fly from Brussels to Nice, one way ticket. All the tariffs were sky high ! I came across Skypicker, where I found a flight on a regular company, at a normal hour, including luggage at a very interesting rate. I can only recommend you Skypicker !
5	"Emma at Skypicker deserves 7 stars so here's an extra 2 ** Emma. Excellent customer service and very friendly and funny also. Changed my flight dates with no hassle at all, was just told "" leave it with me and I'll call you when its done"", perfect!!! Can't recommend her enough, would definitely use Skypicker again if this is the usual level of customer service."
5	My honest review i was kind scare try this apps but excellent price travel out the usa with my son firts time to my son and i send email to request him to be on the window and i tought i will never going to get a answer but to my surprise mrs.

1	"I booked a flight with <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> from Manila to Puerto Princesa. Three days before the flight, I got an email saying the flight time had been changed - to over 3 hours earlier. I wouldn't arrive to Manila in time to catch the flight. When I told the travel agent Filip I couldn't accept these changes, this was his response: (quoted from transcript)""As you can know, we are TRAVEL AGENCY... We are not the airline. If you are not satisfied with their decision, you have to contact CEBU PACIFIC""He further refused to help and told me that I had no ""<http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> guarantee,"" even though I had booked other future flights through <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>. He said this was because I had not booked all of my flights under the same reservation.Then I found a flight through Cebu Pacific CLOSER to my original time, and I was told I would have to pay a fee to be put on it. Pay a fee to be put on a flight that was closer to my original time?! How ridiculous, when I didn't even change my flight or consent to it being changed in the first place!Furthermore, the webpage is also not updated; it will not load my ""new"" flight time and the boarding passes were messed up.In total, a horrible and distressing situation days before leaving on holiday. Travel is already stressful, so the travel agents attitude made things much work. He did agree to call Cebu Pacific to fix the error on my boarding passes, but he said if I wanted to change my flight, I would have to pay a fee. I would never book with them again.I am a travel writer for three Canadian travel magazines. I have travelled extensively and I have never experienced this level of incompetence in this field. I am ashamed of <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>."
5	By now this is the cheepest flight.The online suport is great. Vlada Gusar answered promptly with my questions. I hope her email answer will be as prompt as the suport and the flight will be smooth.
5	We really had problem with connections flight because of Norwiegan. We mailed to Kiwi and they answered just few minutes after that and helped us to book new flights, and give us money for hotel and tranfser, without any troubles. Can absolutley recommend this agent. Thumbs up
5	Very kind customer service and very quick solution on my booking mistake.
5	The airline with which I had booked my flights cancelled them at the airport on Jan 1st. The Kiwi staff was very helpful, and within 2 hours had booked me on the next available flight (with a different airline) leaving the next day, at no additional cost. I was helped by Lukas and Pedro, who were great.
5	Excellent customer support, would love to use it in the future!
5	Skypicker is a simple, economical, and all around excellent travel booking site. It helps you find the best way to get to your destination, looking at all available options including multiple airlines and routes. Prices are often better than other sites, and you can sort results by quality, duration, and price among other things. Once you've made the booking, Skypicker checks you in and emails you the boarding passes as soon as they're available, so it's very convenient. I'm always impressed at how on top of things they are, and I've never had any issues. This is the easiest way to find and book flights by far. I'd recommend Skypicker to anyone.
5	Just completed check in with Skypicker's chat service and the process was quick and easy. Although it was at first very confusing trying to check in as there is no clear way of doing so, I got a response from Enri A on the customer service chat instantly and was happy to get a polite and positive conversation with a member of the team. Check in was completed very quickly, so I am impressed with the service although of course a clear indication of how to do so in the first place would have been great too.

5	I am really satisfied with the customers services! thanks for your help Babak!
4	Jana fixed all my issues that the website had created. thank you, you're an angel.
4	I missed my opportunity check-in online but after I contracted <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>'s customer service, and got through to Jan S., everything was sorted out and I got all the help I needed to check in online.Great customer service, I'm looking forward to use <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> again!
5	i would to say thank you for the immediate and helpful assistance to Mr Martin Pospilis and mr pavel, they really did a good job!!!!
5	Buon servizio clienti, Daniele è stato molto gentile e disponibile. Consigliato.
5	James.
5	I was a bit sceptical of using sky picker as I had never heard of them before but saw good reviews so went for it. I booked flights in New Zealand whilst I was in the UK so I put a lot of trust in them. I wasn't disappointed - great fares and nothing hidden. Would definitely use again!
5	Thanks for ur great service Filip, thanks for solving my problem  which I've been frustrated for so long.... this is my sons first flight...I hope we will have a very very enjoyable vacation...Thank u so much !!!
5	#Skypicker The most powerful flight search engine! It includes warranty for stops with lowcost airlines like ryanair <https://t.co/ACK8pkTj5A>
5	Despite a warning that said that service may be delayed due to high traffic, I got helped right away by Petra M.via Kiwi's customer service chat option. I was contacting Kiwi about adding bags to my flight, and Petra was able to quickly and efficiently assist me. Although there were some delays throughout as Petra got my rates, etc., she kept me updated and on the line. I was able to resolve the whole thing quickly and without having to wait near the phone. Yay!
5	Valery was very helpful in answering my query about airport check-in and updating information for me.
5	Rebecca is my STAR AGENT who had been very helpful to me solving my concern. She is very patient, kind, and emphatic, that is to say, she understands and acted immediately to help me with me errands.And THANK YOU LENKA as well for your cooperation. Lenka is also a part of this commedation!Thank you ladies for your help! :) You are both an asset to this Company! :)
5	Jan was very helpful submitting a request to change flight, I hope it works.
4	Everything worked as expected. Some may be confused that they might have to wait up to 24h before getting the tickets, but I got mine within minutes.I have deducted one star because of the final step of the order process; on that step you are encouraged to rent a car at the destination and too many of those rental companies are 1-star companies on trustpilot, reported for trying to cheat customers.
5	The service was quick and they gave me the tickets on time. Very reliable and proactive.
4	Couldn't figure out how the online check in with SkyPicker worked, but Adam of the live chat support helped me and it just took less than a minute. Very kind and fast support! Awsome service. Thank you :)
5	Martina you Rock ! :)You were quick and efficient,may the 4th be with youtook only 3 mn to solve my problem
4	Really fast to buy tickets and simple to follow in each passages. The assistance service work very well.
5	Just got a few questions and Krystina help me a lot and fast to solve everything and to safe some money at the airport! Great service!!
4	great service of pakja :)
5	Thanks to the quick and easy service provided by Tomas and <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> I was able to save half the amount on extra baggage charges by booking for my next flight segment whilst sitting on plane on the prior flights segment.Shame about oneworld not checked bags through across the network since June 2016 but outside of Kiwi's control and will recommend even with rechecking baggage for each different airline.
5	Thanks a lot for great help. Pavel and Martin.
5	satisfied with your soon response
4	First time used and will use it again. No problems. However I think the service will be tested only once a flight is missed and a replacing flight is needed. If that works well too then it's 5/5.
5	After Vueling had cancelled the flight, Alan Whitfield on live chat was very nice to help us fix the issue immediately, changing the departure airport with no troubles at all. I am very pleased with the service from <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> and its employees so far.
5	We spoke to Kostya who assisted us with a change in travel details. Right from the start, Kostya was incredibly polite, helpful and prompt and the manner was sorted for us within a few moments. Thank you so much for your help and we would definitely recommended <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> to our friends and family :)
5	Excellent experience!

I really appreciate your helping .thank you
4	Had a lot of trouble getting everything completed.But, the way they handle this is top of the bill Friendly, and they care for the concerns you have, because flying is always stressful, and they (Barbara....thank you for you time)...do everything to make it less stressful Thanks to the crew of <http://KIWI.COM|KIWI.COM>
5	They make it very easy to me to love their service.Especially the customer service at the chat with Barbara was so enjoyable.Thank you, Barbara!
5	I had to contact Skypicker several times to reschedule flights and to ask for a refund. They were extremely helpful and plesant and helpful. They were always available and made the process very easy. I would recommend their service to others.
4	Anna T was very helpful with my problem with my boarding pass.
4	Everything important worked just fine, no problems there.I'd like it to be made clear that 'cabin baggage' means that you take it on the plane with you. I only learnt this through trial and error!
5	I booked 3 flights with this company. its good price and goes really fast. we are travelling as a couple. to barcelona and rome.Ezster helped me with everything i needed through livechat on internet on there website.first i was a little worrid that its a small company and maybe you dont get that good help because its all through internet. but i was really suprised, it was the best service i have ever got through internet!she was really nice and helpfull. she also gave me some advices of transportation on my trips. which actually is not her job. So i am really really satisfied with this company. And thank you Eszter for all support!!!
5	We had some problems with delayed flights cause of technical problems. So we missed the next flight home. But an easy contact to kiwi support solves the problem to my fullest satisfaction. I would choose kiwi any time for my next vacation.
5	Excellent customer service.Thank you very much Lucas for answering all of my questions about my booking.
1	"Do not trust or support these crooks. After booking three return flights through Skypicker from Stansted to Rhodes, during our trip our return flight was cancelled because of air traffic control strikes. This was obviously not the fault of Skypicker, but our flights needed to be rescheduled. To cut a long story short, we had to take initiative with Skypicker because even though they were aware of the strike, they did not contact us until we contacted them. It took us 15 phone calls back and forth with Skypicker to finally get them to pay to rearrange a flight home three days after our scheduled flight. Our friends who were in the same boat but had booked their flights via Agean, Ryanair, and Opodo ALL had their flights rearranged without any problems. Not only that, but all of them were provided with accommodation and one of them even had his car hire paid for.Skypicker on the other hand were refusing to pay for anything that was more than their ""budget"" and were initially suggesting we take a flight a WHOLE WEEK later. If you think that's bad, they made an offer to arrange travel by boat to Kos to then take a flight home from there but BLACKMAILED us by saying the following which we have in an email: ""Please mind that in case you agree to the offered solution, we would really need a mutual favour from your side: three 5 star reviews, one by each of the passengers, left on our official Facebook or Trustpilot pages"".After finally coming to an agreement of a flight they paid for, we went to the airport to speak with the airline about getting some accommodation paid for. We were told this would not be possible because Skypicker had taken the refund from our initial cancelled flights. So effectively they spent next to nothing on the extra flights and acted like they were doing us a favour.Skypicker will respond about how hard they worked to find a solution. They will tell us and everyone on Facebook about their guarantee and how this situation did not exactly fall under their guarantee. But the fact is that this is exactly the sort of thing they should be prepared to deal with or at least know how to deal with rather than completely ruin someone's trip and then act like they are doing them a favour with zero regard for customer service.Every other company happily took a financial loss in exceptional circumstances for their customers, but Skypicker were simply not wiling to and then tried blackmailing us into leaving 5 star reviews. Never again. Cheaper flights aren't worth it. Just use a reputable company or airline."
4	"One of the flights that i booked got cancelled, so I received an email saying that I had to reschedule the flight, or agree to reschedule to the flight that skypicker had rebooked me to. The problem was that the flight I got rebooked to left an hour before I even arrived the airport. And it was impossible to reschedule by myself, because the every time I tried to reschedule i got the error ""501 Bad Gateway"". So I sent an email, and i got no response. But I got a lot of help from the agent in the livechat, so i would recommend people to use the livechat! They rescheduled me to a flight that left the next day, and I got promissed a refund for the extra night I had to stay there."
5	For whose saying that skypicker is a bad company, that's absolutely Bullshit!!!I wanna first thanks Alikhan Ramazanov who fixed our problem, then Ivana vlahovic for her kindness, Tomaš Jurik, Graeme Fairweather, Irene Zhuk, Jolana Dominguez and the others who were part of their help and assistance for us.We got a really bad flight from Kuala Lumpur to Gold Coast, it should take roughly 7h but we took over 40h to get Aussie.We were really desperate and skypicker team was really helpful, still upgraded our status, where we are and try to arrange our connection flight to Wellington as much as they can and they did!Thanks again guys! You are the best!
5	The reservation was easy, their prices the lowest. All the informations they provide are complete and accurate, they kept in touch with me all the way until the end of the trip. I'm very happy with the service.
5	customer support very very good  congratulations !! Luis, Tomas, Bek.

5	Faster and easy , short time to waiting , fix the issue  so thank you to call operator Aurelija !
5	I was very happy with the level of support!I have contacted two times the support team, the first time directly to chat and the second time I have written directly to the support team. Both were professional and helped me with my request in a very short time.Kudos to both!Chat member: Oksana SSupport member:Bachana Kuprashvili
3	You will definitely get an adventure with skyfucker, the adventure starts when they fuck up your booking and blame you and then make you wait a full day for a response, by the time you don't resolve it your trip is over
2	Huriyat was very helpful answering my questions. However the boarding passes Skypicker issued did not show what type of seat I had been checked into and Skypicker told me they were unable to even see that information themselves – I don't know why I can pay 800 dollars for a ticket and the company can't even tell me wether I've bought a window seat.
1	Worst company ever! You should think to close it. NOW.
5	I am super satisfied with the costumer service 5 starts Indeed. :) Thank you, Maria!
5	I was attended for a  very nice person Lusine.
4	Customer service by Klara, Leonardo M., Mohammed, Lenka N. Was great. Answered all my questions and got us on the proper flights. Only reason I put 4 out of 5 was due to the original flight and 1st rescheduled flight cancelling, so we had to take a 3rd flight, requirng us to stay 2 nights at the original layover, loosing days in our destination. This is not the fault of kiwi though- just the flights they work with. Overall, very satisfied!
1	"Multi stop business trip booked through these guys. First flight fine into Moscow, flying out of Moscow to Minsk airline informed me that bags were not booked onto the flight.  I had to go to the other side of the airport to argue that they were. I showed them my <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> sticker and they said that this is nonsense and not a real ticket as it is not issued by the airline. They said that I had to pay or I couldn't fly, then I would be out of my visa and may be arrested.  They informed me that this was a common problem with this booking site and I shouldn't trust them or use it again. I had to pay for my luggage from my daily company business allowance. This meant that I couldn't buy dinner last night on arrival in Minsk. I contacted customer service today and they said ""sorry"" please send your recipe for a refund.... no offer of any further compensation. Just a generic ""never mind I don't care response"" They said they would double check my next three flights (but the airline told me they can't check because they are not inside the airline's system. I suggest you only use this website if you travel with lots of spare cash and don't mind being stressed out before every flight, embarrassed at the check in or not sleeping the night before a flight because they may or may not have gotten your bags into the flight. They don't care, they think refunding you what you eventually pay is enough for all that stress."
5	Agent named Lukas provided me a very good quality of assistance by answering my questions in the most professional/properly/quick way.
5	My lugage was lost during a flight operated by Tiger Air. I contacted the support service of Skypicker and I found it really efficient and nice. Jan Lukasek was really helpful, and I had quick answer. My problem is not solved yet but he did a lot and he also made sure that his colleagues will keep helping me the next day.
5	Everything perfect. Thank you.
5	Great service and organised website. Very easy to contact and vally was great help answering & helping all my enquiries. Thanks heaps, would recommend to anyone!
5	Not my first time getting help from their help desk and once more the help have been brilliant! This time I got aid from a woman named Anna T. Who swiftly and perfectly helped me in less than five minutes and saved me a lot of stress and heartache for the day.Thank you so much once more Anna and I suggest if you have any troubles, just contact support, they are sure to aid you swiftly!
1	I am having a terrible experience with Kiwi!! I was booking a flight from UK to the US and after getting an error in the website booked it again. I realized the mistake and got in touch less than 15 hours afterwards (I called, chatted and sent an email) to cancel one of the flights. I received an email today saying that since the bookings were made a few days ago they cannot be voided. And my refund came up to 33 EUR on a 685 GBP flight!! Since two of the flights are to/from the US and were cancelled less than 24 hours after purchase I should get a full refund at least on them.I have repeatedly used kiwi and have had great experiences. I am very disappointed with the way this has been handled so far and really hope they will be able to help me sort this out reasonably!
5	5 stars to Alan who gave me excellent service regarding an issue I had with the check-in. Within 5 minutes I had the boarding passes sent to my email. Thanks!
1	U guy have hidden charges so bad
4	Not everything was perfect with a cancelation I had to make due to an error in one of the names of the people traveling, but when I finally got in contact with Henry Gharagyozyan, he made everything run smooth and perfect. He has great manners and was amazingly helpful! Big thanks!!! Otherwise prices are awesome here!
5	Very Good helpers
5	Yesterday has been a very stressful day for me as my flight from Catania to London was largely delayed because of a volcanic eruption that made also impossible to get on time to my connection flight to my final destination.Luckily I've booked everything with Skypicker and they were tireless to find me alternatives and change my flights.I would like to give a special THAN YOU to  Clarisse Carrier, who did all the process of research of the flights. Also a big than you to Guljamila Aliya, Mariya Potello, Tanya O. (and excuse me if I'm missing someone) who were the people I spoke with on the phone and made everything possible to help me getting to my final destination.I'll definitely book again with SkypickerThank you once more.Kind regards,Bruno Pereira
5	Extremely helpful staff. I had a flight delay that caused me to miss my connecting flight, and they were prompt, and extremely helpful in getting me on the next available flight free of charge. The airline was not helpful at all, but Skypicker got it sorted out very quickly. Extremely satisfied in Kuala Lumpur!
5	If u need buy ticket for your travel, no doubt to buy in this places 100% ,quality and assists for everythingOf course a good prices... and excellent schedule.Thks Patrick Pivoda for answers so quickly .. good costumer services..
5	Genuinely a great system for booking multiple flights , as much about cost of same and length of stopovers. It gives you numerous options. Customer service was very efficient, I had no worries about my trip everything ran smoothly
5	The situation in Venezuela is alarming, the airport that I was originally to leave from (Maiquetia), was in such poor condition. No air conditioning, elevators weren't working, escalators out of order. It was truly a nightmare.There are very few airlines left in service at this airport, Insel is one of them and it was clear to me that they are at the mercy of whomever is running the show in Maiquetia Airport. They decide weather or not to let an airline leave or cancel the flights at their leisure.I would like to thank <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> for keeping in contact with me throughout, and making sure that I was getting to my destinations. That kept me calm, and feeling that even if I was to miss one of my connecting flights, <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> would have gotten me on the next one
1	I am having very bad experience with <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>. They don't have any connecting flight and they just issued separate tickets for all the flights and would need visa to collect our luggage.. I am ending up with waste of money of whole ticket . After that, I called the customer care line and people can't even give a answer of question and I try to contact them on live chat and over there it looks like everybody is sleeping  there . Really very bad experience. After all nobody help mePlease don't buy tickets from them and waste your money .Good luck
5	Your colleagues are very helpful, especially Radim.K who did his best to eliminate my problem! Thanks
5	i am very satisfied for the help when i need it very quikly and very gently.. i spoke with an agent called PETRA and she was flawless!
2	A startup that finds discount flight tickets 'hidden' on airline websites just launched in the US <https://t.co/Ruc3X4uupt>
4	Eric at Kiwi was very pleasant to work with over the phone. He was straight forward and observant of my needs. Thank you for the wonderful service!
5	Had a very good experience with skypicker , the lady named Petra helped me through booking my tickets and also excellent service. Thank you so much Petra
5	Victor was very helpfull with explaining me the whole proces of booking and getting boarding passes with Skypicker and i was calmed knowing that Skypicker is doing everything instead of me for my check-in online. That means a lot to passangers believe me!
4	Very ggod assistance through the live chat, helping me doing all the steps required for the check-in operations.Enri A. was competent and helpful.Thanks.
1	Beware people! Do not use their services or buy your ticket from them even though they are cheap! We can't check in online on kiwi website or either from Ryan air.Kiwi wrote that we have to send our passport information to them the latest on the 24th of January, to be able to do the online check in, but we received the email about this information on the 25th of January, which is one day too late. We thought we can check in directly in the airport but apparently at the check in desk they said that we have to pay airport fees for us to. E able to check in. The airport people both in Copenhagen and in Brussels was also confused and how could this happen, and they said that they heard a lot about <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> that they are really bad and they all even said that they recommend us to never ever use <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> again in the future, because the airport people have heard and experience a lot of the customers who use <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> service, always having problems!We called kiwi after, and they said that they can see the problem, but they won't refund our airport fees that we paid, because of their own mistakes,  it ours!!Very very bad service and we are very upset customers!Please, safe yourself from having any trouble and headache!
5	I've contacted them on multiple occasions and they're all very helpful especially Yulia Krasenko he also give me additional info other the one that I'm asking. So I highly recommend it for anyone looking for the cheapest deals on flight and travels.
5	I was making 2 reservations which had many passengers, many changes and complications involved and with every single one of them I managed thanks to the very responsive and helpful customer service.I would like to thank Elsa C and Lenka K for the extensive help.
2	We purchased 2 tickets from you guys from OTP to BGY. Found out when our family arrived at the airport the tickets were fake. Was on the phone for 4 hours in the middle of the night trying to resolve this, and still no resolution.
5	I just contacted Kiwi regarding a baggage query. I spoke to Aura who was extremely helpful and attentive with my query, In fact she found the exact (and lower) price for my checked baggage. Very grateful for her help, thanks so much!
1	Purchased return flights for family of 4. This included a seat for a 23 month old child. The on-line process readily took my money for 4 seats, yet <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> issue me with 3 tickets and an infant boarding pass. I ring and complain post the outward journey. They say they will get back to me however do not and I am faced with the same problem of paying for nothing and having a heavy child sit on parents lap for the return flight. Many words exchanged on second long call however no promise to reimburse. Finally days later an offer to compensate that is less then the cost of one way ticket! This is ridiculous.
5	All that pleasantness and a keen ability for customer service. Just when I thought I'd be stranded in Manila, Guljamila came through for me. I can't even describe how pleasant the experience was dealing with someone with such a delightful phone presence. Customer Service well above what is expected.Thank you, now let me get that coffee for you!! (inside joke)
4	helped us a lot
4	The system is sometimes a little to actually understand and a few techincal difficulties but the customer service team have been very helpful and resolved my issues.
5	I've already booked multiple times via Skypicker and have always been getting what I asked for. But today, the customer service team (Honza) went the extra mile. No-frills carriers don't let you check-in online prior flights when traveling to many locations across SEA, but Skypicker bothered to give me a call and explain the situation and notify me to be at the airport on time. Great job guys. *****
5	"I would like to express my gratitude for all the support that I got from skypicker during my last (and difficult) journey from Spain to Germany. Specially to a worker on the UK-hotline called ""Greg"" who really helped us out when we were ""stucked"" at Birmingham's airport.. we lost our 1st connection to Germany because of a strike in France,.. and a 2nd one, which was supposed to flight trow Brussels on the sad date of 22march.. in both cases skypicker promptly find a new flight for us, and ensured that we were well accommodated.. Basically your service works! and works good.. I highly recommend and you're gonna definitely be my 1st option to travel with in the near future!! thank you guys for being professional!!"
5	Jonathan was very helpful on the phone and got me all set up for my flight!
5	A+++++++++++ hats off to you guy's and your amazing prices, and customer support. Yuoseff thank you so much for the quick response and accurate answers im going to recommend all my family and friends to visit you guy's again A++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
1	I booked through skypicker to travel on 28th January.  The airline changed the flight so I was sent an alternative travel plan flying on the 27th.I asked it were possible to have different travel arrangements but was told that was going to cost a considerable amount so I agreed to the initial change and was told I would receive an email on the 26th.On the 26th there was no email so I emailed skypicker to be told they would reply within 48 hours.  That was not ok as my intended travel was in 24 hours.I spoke with an agent on live chat.  The agent confirmed I was travelling on the 28th at 20.00 from Singapore with Jetstar.  I knew that flight no longer existed.  I spent hours trying to get the agent to check... but in the end she wouldn't do anything and sent me another email confirming travel on the 28th!!!  On a non-existent flight.By this stage I was really frightened.  I was travelling alone in a non-English speaking country wondering if I was going to get home at all.I had no phone so I had to add money to Skype and call a telephone number where finally I got hold of a young man who did listen and realised there was an awful mistake.  Eventually I got an email confirming travel on the 27th.This totally wrecked the last days of my holidays - with hours spent trying to get this problem sorted.  The online agent Lusine G was hopeless.And the so called cheap fare ended up costing me more than $200 extra.I would avoid this company at all costs!
3	@Ryanair I have my boarding passes via @skypickercom but no confirmation numbers to check in online w/ @Ryanair. Will I still be charged?
4	Had to book additional luggage. Used the live chat service. The fee is pricey, but the agent Neil was very nice and helpful.
5	At first I must admit I was very skeptical about this company after I bought my ticket. I flew from Haiti to Paris on two connecting flights. my boarding passes were here on time & I passed through each airport smoothly. Would like to thank Graeme, and other agents of this company that assisted me in everything. my ticket was super affordable as well! thankkkk you so much! will be booking again & i definitely recommend this website to anyone! (it could be stressful if you have checked baggages but that's just me)
1	Sure the prices look relatively inexpensive, however, every time I would try to purchase a ticket, the price would increase by at least $130 after I clicked on it.  What is up with this Kiwi??? I will not be using your site any longer.
3	Airline is asking me for a Visa Malaysia, even I'm travelling to Bali, and to do luggage check in all over again @skypickercom #BadService
4	Found a good deal the only thing that brought it down to a 4 was the online checkin system was fare from the greatest and cause me a very frustrating evening but there online chat support saved the day!!!!
5	Was a great help. We were able to accomplish everything that we wanted for our flight.
4	Thanks AuraI forgot to add my middle name to my booking. I wish there was a tip on the reservation site but I should also have known. It's fixed now by the customer service department.
5	Thank you Emma for the help given on my upcoming trips. I appreciate your patience and understanding.  Keep up the good work.
3	Skypicker, a Czech start-up that helps you find cheapest airfare, has launched in the U.S. Congrats! @skypickercom <https://t.co/gJX77pNqyg>
1	I booked a round trip flight with <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>.  The airline cancelled the return leg so I was informed by Kiwi that there was an alternative flight which I agreed to take instead.  When I arrived at the airport the airline for the return flight claimed there was no reservation so I had to buy the return leg at a higher price than the original round trip cost.  I provided all the documentation to Kiwi but they denied my claim stating that they had booked a flight on that airline.  If this were true, why would I buy two tickets on the same airline for the same day and time.  They don't stand behind their reservations.  Terrible service!
1	<http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> is able to offer you a flight for price which no longer exists twice in a row, they  even charge your credit card twice and after 1 and 1/2 hour from on line purchase  you got an email appologize for unsuccesful reservation..you have to wait for money return and  dont know 90 minut if you bought a ticket or not..I have found this price and purchase  politic very unfair, other web portals selling flight tickets do not enable this pre-  reservation ...be aware of that!!!!
5	Excellent online service by Skypicker! Quick and to the point!
5	Super fast chat service, got what I wanted in no time. Keep it up!
3	Jr Reyes works for these guys.You may get the cheapest price but you may also have to pay for it twice to get it on the right day. Go Expedia or any other booking agent, these guys are thieves and liars
5	I was booking a ticket formy mom, but something went wrong and instead of Mrs on the ticket it said Mr. I got panicked, but after getting in touch by phone to the lovely Mr.Owen W. from costumer care, I had my nerves calmed down again.Thank you very much to <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> and expecially to their costumer care for being so helpful and understanding.
5	Kiwi is a great site to find inexpensive travel deals. I wanted to see if it was possible to change my flights (due to a last minute circumstance), and the representatives I have spoken with, especially most recently, Martin Carter, have all been really attentive, communicative, and collaborative in trying to find solutions for my particular situation.I really appreciate the help from everyone so far, and highly recommend this agency service.
5	Excellent service
4	Spoke to Martin on live chat and he was very helpful, sorted my problem!
5	The flight was without any problems
5	I have choosen wrong month for my tickets... As far as I am russian web web site offered me to call 24/7 russian number <tel:+7(499)3482649|+7(499)3482649>, I have called 3 times, no answer.After that I called to the number for people from US, and I am so happy I did, I have got almost full refound. The offices of airlines were closed, so Simon kept me informed step by step before the last air line started to work. Than you very much! Keep helping people, it is very important!
5	Jan was fantastic and help me for the checkin online!
5	Dear <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com>,Today I had some issue with my luggage, but this issue was successfully solved by your colleague Alikhan who was very kind and polite
5	Just thougt that i was the only one asking infromation it went so fastThank you
4	I am pleased with the service that Skypicker provided, all the information they gave me checked out. I only wish that the mailing of boarding cards was organized better, because I received several emails instead of one and it made it a lot messier than it should be.
5	I booked 3 flights for my wife and children through Skypicker / Easyjet.Booking was easy and I received clear emails explaining what to do until I received the boarding passes. When reviewing them I realised that the seats were not the ones next to the others, and that the seat for my 7 year old son was far from my wife and daughter's. I then phoned Skypicker (as advised in their email) and first spoke to a lady. After explaining my problem, there was a communication problem and she couldn't hear me any longer, despite the fact that I could hear her. She advised me to phone back as she couldn't hear me at all, which I did. I then spoke to a man who was really helpful and he explained that Easyjet provides seats randomly and that he had to change the seat for me with them, but that there was a 10€ fee to change 2 seats (there was no seat available next to my wife and daughter, but 2 seats available next to my son), which I was ok to pay for. I received an email with a link so that I can pay the fee and then waited to receive the new boarding passes. The next day, the Travel consultant phoned me to tell me that he had made the change and he wanted to make sure that I received the boarding passes in my mailbox and that everything was ok. The service was excellent and I would recommend contacting Aamer Tageldin (the travel consultant I spoke to) for any question or issue you have with your booking using Skypicker.
5	My flight times were switched unexpectedly by the airline and I could not make the alternative flight offered. I had to contact Kiwi via their live chat feature to fix it as I was out of the country at the time and couldn't call. Every single person I interacted with from the company was extremely helpful and professional. They worked with me to resolve the issue. I would highly recommend booking through them based on their excellent prices and fantastic customer service.
4	Thank you for solving our problem, Tanyia. I was really stressed about our flight from Paris to Porto because of the strike and you solved our problem. Your job was not easy, I'm sure of it, but you made it. We will arrive home later, but we will. Bucharest was nice, but we want to go back home to Porto. Once again, thank you Tanya.
5	Babak helped me find my booking and send me a the info right away and was very helpfull.
5	Tomáš Mužík went above and beyond to make me feel comfortable using Skypicker and help resolve my issues. He was incredibly kind, polite, and professional. Definitely put me at ease!
5	I was quite wary when I booked the flights as I had never done anything like this before, but skypicker were brilliant, even when I put the wrong expiry date when I was doing the online check in, the customer support helped me with it, they were really helpful and I couldn't believe how smooth the whole process was and im already looking to book something else with them, I would highly recommend them to anyone A++++++
1	They made my girlfriend go through hell and we lost a lot of money because of their ineficient work. She ended up having to buy new tickets on lastminute, they did the job way better
5	I was looking for a flight for X-mas and looked on several websites. At this time of the year flights are usually pretty expensive but, when I tried SkyPicker, it found a flight for less than half the price on other websites! I must say this flight had some layovers while some of the others didn't but still, most of the times if you go to these websites it's because you want the cheapest flight irrespective of layovers....Furthermore, the purchasing was easy and they even did the check-in online for me! ;)
4	Very good service! Spoke to Pedro, and in a minute I had my boardingpasses from Copenhagen to Montpellier Thank you!
5	When i tried to book a flight, the total price on the screen was different than the actual bank withdrawl, which i could not see/realise till the provision was taken. Therefor i contacted their live chat assistance. Mr Gregory, has shown utmost interest in the case, although he couldnt open the link i sent, he made a new research and prepared a new reservation behalf of me. He stayed online with me, with very much patience until the provision was taken. Finally i realised that the price difference is totally my bank's commission, which happens due to currency rates. I strongly advise skypicker, due to such interests, helps and conveinent prices at all time.
1	"So far, my experience with this site just continues to worry me. Last night I booked a reservation for my husband and I to fly out on Christmas Eve in the hopes of being with family for at least part of the holidays. I entered all of our information and received an email letting me know that my request was being processed. At that time, I felt a little more confident that our money and time had been invested in something that was worth the effort. I went to sleep knowing I would soon be home, and hopefully without any stressful complications. I'm about 4 moths pregnant now with my first child, so the last thing I want is to be frustrated over things that could possibly leave me practically broke and/or stranded somewhere unfamiliar for Christmas. I woke up this morning and immediately proceeded to check my email to make sure everything was okay and that the booking process had gone smoothly. I was pleased to see two emails, one containing my booking receipt, and the other claiming that the email address I had provided could not be verified, and that an alternate one was required to finish the process. I figured, okay, no biggie. I don't understand why this email address doesn't work, but okay. I assumed that perhaps I needed to give one that was associated with the bank account used for the purchase, so I tried to type that one in. Without even clicking submit, a notification kept popping up. prompting me to give a verifiable email address. I tried the only other 2 that my husband and I had. None of them worked. Suddenly, I started to feel like I should've never gone with this site. Thoughts flooded my head, they're a scam, they're going to take our money and we won't be able to get it back, we'll try to call them and demand a refund or that they fix whatever happened and they'll just be assholes about it and take advantage of us, I won't be home for Christmas, everything is going to fall apart. I get on my computer, thinking maybe it'll be easier rather than trying to use my phone. I look at the email again, and get a different message this time when I go to provide an alternate email address. Now it's saying that they've received my order confirmation and everything will be processed shortly. I sigh with relief in my mind, and feel better. Didn't know what I did, but something worked. Until I go back to my inbox. There's a new email with the title ""Failure to book-security issue."" Son of a bitch... The email says that it has not been possible to process my booking, and the reason being is that the carrier has reported a security issue. They were unable to continue booking and have refunded the full amount of 2012 EUR, which should be shown in my account within 10 working days. All those terrible thoughts come back. Something else is going to ""coincidentally"" happen to keep me from getting my money back. I'm going to be one of those people that I've read about in review forums that go through nightmare airfare scams. I quickly call a representative trying to get the issue straightened out. She can't seem to provide a good enough explanation as to why any of this happened to begin with. All she can say is that she's sorry and I will be getting a full refund, but cannot hold the reservation, unfortunately. After realizing that questions were pointless due to always getting the same broken record response, I say thank you and hang up. I feel even worse, I never should've went through this site. Everything is ruined. I'm pregnant and hormonal, and now very stressed out, so I cry a little, try to let some of it out. Then go looking for reviews to see what my chances are of actually getting my money back. Most of the ones I find look so incredibly fake and well rehearsed, I don't know what to believe. Now here I am, writing my own review on Facebook, that's definitely not fake. I doubt I could sell a person if my life depended on it. I still don't know what I'm going to do. I suppose now I should look for different tickets. But, that's my experience. Not the worst I suppose, compared to other horror stories, yet. We'll see what kind of activity, if any, is happening with my bank account. For now, it's just a terribly inconvenient and stressful situation, and the first I've come across in my years of flying and going through middle-man booking agencies."
4	It took over a month to get my money back for a missed connecting flight but I really appreciated Filip for listening to me and doing everything he could to help speed up the process. Thank you kiwi for standing by your promise.

5	Easy to book and very helpful customer service
5	Big / many  thanks to Daniel Peter without whom I couldn't get my boarding pass. Perceptiveness, seriousness, cleverness, kindness...a pleasure to talk to. It was a relieve to know I can get help and trust from Daniel ( <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> )I would highly recommend, you are in good hands with <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com>100% satisfied / pleased.Greetings from Denmark
5	Booked flight to Alicante from Copenhagen and everything was just perfect. I asked for assistance at Copenhagen because I have trouble walking to far and to stand to long. They were so helpful when I called:-)) Unfortunately I don't remember the names I talked to, but the service was just great.
5	Thank you Elena for a wonderful customer service experience :) You help us with everything!!!

5	Ms Ivana Vlahovic was very helpful. Some of your staff are the best and Ms Ivana is one of them. Thank you
5	Convenient with live chat service provided.
3	"I had to cancel my flights just a few days after the booking due to my urgent matters so I asked them if I can cancel my flight and get refund via Livechat. The agent I met for the very first time on the livechat just said that they can cancel my flight but no refund, no refund at all. I was so embarrassed and upset and reminded me of those many bad reviews about booking companies for cheaper flights like kiwi. I talked to my self like ""This is my turn now?"" However, I emailed them asking cancelation/refund afterward just hoping to get a better answer and I've got an email from Senior Travel Consultant, man named Michael Angelo. He said totally different things unlike the agent I met on the livechat. He said I can get my refund as well as the cancelation. He also confirmed that how much I will get refund. That makes me so confused. How come two persons say differently? what if I just didn't try to contact them again just thinking I was rooked. I contacted them again via livechat 1 month after the  Senior Travel Consultant promised me the refund to check further notice because I haven't got any other news what is going on. I talked to one of their agent, Maira. she helped me to check what happened and what can she help me to get refund. It finally turned out that my first experience with Kiwi was like roller coasters. I am not sure if I will use them again but I will only when my flight schedule is absolutely sure and zero chance of cancellation."
5	I did not know <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com>, was searching for a return flight for my wife and my child,  and found a cheap one, excellent service, everything worked perfectly. So for my first experience, i can recommend <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> without any problem.
5	Eleonora was helpful and made my online check in easy as dream. Excellent service. Thumbs up.
2	We've used the a few times without knowing, and it really went smoothly and all, until we realised we had packed a bit too much. We tried to upgrade from 15 kg luggage to 20 kg, and it was possible to do through Ryan Air (one of the worst Airline Services in the world) 2 hours before departure. However, our reservation was made through Momondo, who the used <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> to book our tickets, without us knowing. Because their policy says, that they can't make any change to our reservation within 48 hours of our departure, they couldn't upgrade our luggage, meaning that we have to pay a fee Because we didn't pack 48 hours before departure  (I mean, who packs that early?)
5	I had needed some information about flight cancellation and my worries were quickly dispersed by the help of Nina. Now I can book another flight with ease. Thanks again for everything
3	@skypickercom I'm sure it's a challenge, but also the one missing piece of the puzzle. Not going to scroll past 100s of Spirit flights…
5	Amazing being in India and get immediate chat assistance. Great help from Adam Jelínek informing us at every step. Great patience as we are unfamiliar with these type of bookings. Travelling made easy and pleasant.Thank you Adam and kiwi

5	I was having trouble checking in on the website and spoke to Jan S. over the live chat who helped me out quickly and efficiently and in a very pleasant and friendly manner. This isn't my usual experience with travel websites so I am very satisfied.
5	"Booking process went smoothly, e-tickets received, no problems.  When we checked in for our flight from Rome to Athens we were asked to pay 40€ extra each for our suitcases, since our booking was classed as ""light"" although our documentation from Kiwi showed luggage was included in the price we had already paid.  I contacted Kiwi later that day and immediately received a reply with a very sincere apology and promise to refund the money.  I sent them copies of the receipts and the money was refunded as promised within a couple of weeks.  They could not have been more helpful and apologetic about the error. I was impressed with their prompt, polite and efficient customer service."
5	I booked my flight through this website but after received my e-ticket, i realized i choose wrong time because i have another flight with same time. I reported to the customer service (Radka and alexandr)and they help Me to get some information from flight company about whether i can cancel my flight and get the refund or i can change my flight. After long conversation they assist me to change to another flight without additional charge. I am very satisfied with their service, and absolutely i will choose <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> for my reference to booking ticket for another trip. Thank you so much <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com>
5	Very good assistance in my boarding pass issue. I'm very happy about the help that has been provided by the person I had on phone, Congrats to her !
5	Great thanks to the Skypickerteam for always quick  response and good solutions when problems appears.
5	I tried kiwi already once...that did not go well. Today hopefully yes and help from Petra M. was very nice and supportive. Thank you. Lucie
4	Your web site wants to be fixed. I found it hard to choose several destinations & points of departure during time of using your map; tried different browsers though. Tbh, I have no idea what hides behind 'reference number' but hey,  Ky, I created this page just as promised and we both agreed on. Im hoping my words reach you. Thanks for all the help and guidance. If it were not for you Id still be struggling with that goddamn booking page by now.
5	I would recommend this company.
4	The customer service rep, Lydia, was very helpful with my request and got things sorted out quickly and efficiently. Thank you Lydia.
5	Very helpful support from Aamer Tageldin when I needed to make some last minute changes to my booking.
4	I really appreciate these guys' business! Special thanks to representative Petr. :)
1	May be this is a single case, but just had a chat with Kiwi assistant Martina. It was terrible. I asked here, why when I search a ticket from KUL to LED I see one price in calendar and don't see this price in search results. She asked me: is my booking finished? Omg, does she read my question? I asked here about the same once more and received another question - where do I see this price? But I messaged it twice. Also I was waiting for assist 10 minutes and during our chat with Martina she leaved me once for 2 minutes without any words. I'm really disappointed. After that I found the answer to my question myself. Earlier I was using Kiwi(that time Skypicker) to book tickets twice, and that time support done a great job and it was a pleasure talking to them, but now...
1	I've checked the price Kiwi charged me compared to my actual booking with the airline through my membership login, and Kiwi charged $50 aud MORE than the price on my actual airline booking. Extra baggage is 4 times more than what the airline charges. Their terms and conditions are terrible for the consumer. Their customer service is terrible as I was given incorrect information time and again so I went to the airline directly to get the right answers. Why would anyone use this broker service when they sneak in $50 aud for themselves and charge excessive fees to book extra luggage. NEVER EVER AGAIN will I use them
3	"New post: ""A startup that finds discount flight tickets 'hidden' on airline websites just launched in the US"" <https://t.co/jRaJrgchPH>"
5	Owen Wilson was simply amazing. We had an issue with our reservation and he went above and beyond for us. I'm truly impressed by Owen and the care and support he showed. I would book again with them simply because of the level of customer care.
5	Thanks for the help Lucia  fantastic service!
5	I was having issues due to the fact that i mistook the date for my booking as this was my first time  booking a flight and it would have been impossible for me to attend the original booking for my flight but thanks to the help of Jonathan Eghan this got solved. He efficiently provided me with all the information required to calm me in that situation and managed to change my booking date withing the span of 1 hour, which saved me from paying an extra fee which would have been unpleasant to say the least. Thank you for the help Jonathan Eghan. I also wish to say the SKYPICKER's website interface and it's level of interaction are quite impressive and i advise any newcomers to the world of travel to try this website more than once.
5	i had some problems in Contact information and didn't know what to do. i saw Live chat and texted straight away, i didn't hope that some body will help me, but you did, i don't have to wait so long to get a reply from you. Emre T was patient and helped my to fix the problem. i really am happy with this service. this is my 1st time book ticket on Skypicker and i will do again in the future.
5	I experienced an unpleasant airline experience with SAS due to their rule of over booking a flight. SAS rejected our seats due to no seats available although KIWI confirmed the booking. Since 2 flights were impacted with separate airlines, this caused us to be stranded in the originating city. After calling KIWI for help, Andrea immediately investigated and promised to communicate timely in rebooking. He called me hourly four times until the purchase of new tickets was confirmed. While awaiting the airline confirmation, Kristina provided email and calls to let us know we were waiting for the confirmed seats. Although we received it at checkin the following morning, we were happy to have everything resolved by KIWI and will always speak with high recommendations in the future. Thank you!!
1	Absolute shit... booked a flight from denpasar to phuket. Which was a stop in kuala lumpur which was a quick change straight onto flight 2 to phuket. Well when we arrived in kuala lumpur after collecting our luggage to check in for the next flight we couldnt see our flight on the boards so we go to the desk to find out the last flight to phuket was at 16:30(when we were still in the air on our first of 2 flights) and there we were at 7pm trying to check in for our flight which was supposed to be 20:40 (bearing in mind we got sent the boarding passes 5 days before) the people at the desk told us that skypicker were supposed to email us...which you didnt. Luckily Air Asia seemed to know straight away what the problem was when they read skypicker so im guessing its not the first time youve mucked people about luckily they got us on the next flight at no extra charge. But the next flight wasnt for 12 hours so we got stuck with extra expenses with finding somewhere to sleep and also losing money on our already booked hotel in thailand. Will never use your site again..
5	Good and fast service. Thanks for the help! Not all give you the opportunity to return the ticket 2 days before flight. For site developers. You need to pass the system of payment confirmation in the form of pop-UPS to be sure that the payment went.
5	SkyPicker provides excellent web-site with great service and  fair price for tickets. Also you don&#39;t need to be worried about flight check-in.  SkyPicker send boarding passes to your e-mail in time.Thank you.

5	I just booked a great deal with Skypicker!  I entered my email address in incorrectly and Tatiana called me right away to clear things up.  Thank you for being so helpful!  I hope to use them as I travel in the future.
4	Great customer service, prompt response, and very accommodating staff. Keep it up.
5	Very good service from Babak. ����
4	My agent PUPUT checked me in and sent me my boarding passes. Very good customer service especially the guys on the chat. Just a recommendation for future: It would be great if you could send e-tickets as well
1	I just had a real bad experience trying to buy a ticket from Skypicker. The result is while I have been in their system waiting for confirmation, the price has gone up. And after a while I had to do the process all over again. And the same thing happened. So it could be decribed as getting me in to the system, keeping me there, and then after not giving me a ticket during 4-5 hours, offer me a new ticket - but now the price has gone up 80-90 %. I have probably bought 20 flight tickets the last couple of months. Never happened before using Skypicker - then it happens twice during a couple of hours... Bad luck says Skypicker, and I have to take the shit (extra work and more expensive tickets).So why should I use Skypicker again???
4	When travelling, I buy some souviniers, and I was in doubt if i´d hire more kilos for the luggage. It was late at night and the answer did not came on  time. Lucklly Ryanair did not charge me for extra, and I gave up on some souveniers also. It´d be easyer if we could access the company site and purchase by ourselves. The attendats of Skipicker answered me very politely in the following the morning. but I already have gave up.
5	The Travel Agent : ANGELIKA did a all job that should be done. Really good . 10/10!!connection good. price excellent. simple the best.
5	In the beginning I couldn't find the blank to fill in my passport details. Thanks for the help of Mr. Emre. T. This live chat function is indeed useful and practical. People can get the answer of the questions they have almost right away.
5	Great help received from Mr. Stanislav at <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com>Great deals, clear website and quick assistance.
5	I had a flight to check in to the next day. Kiwi was able to get me setup quickly and efficiently entering my passport information and checking me in to my flight
5	Had a query with my flight booking and used the live chat to discuss with one of Kiwis agents. Very helpful and promised to contact airline and email me back. I was a little be sceptical as that's sometimes how they fob you off, but within an hour email received and then also follow up emails from different members of the customer service team and the issue was resolved satisfactorily. Very impressed

5	I spoke to Tomas via the live chat today and he was extremely helpful!
5	It was very easy to find the flights according to our demands and then choose the best option from a great range of airlines. Then I just entered our data and they booked it for us, did out online check-in and sent  our boarding passes to my email.... As easy and comfortable as that!! Great experience.
5	Had forgotten to add passport details. Went to the chat. Victor helped me, quick and easy. He was great!
4	it was realy quik and helpfull thanks
5	thanks to Catalina L for her super help and friendly service)
5	thanks he was very helpful and he did his best
5	had a great experience, gabi was very informative and very helpful thankyou
5	I had a delay on my first flight and i couldn't catch the other plane. I call <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> and in less than an hour, i received the new tickets. <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> was the only good thing that happend than day.. Keep up the good work..
1	Had a very bad experience the first time I used Kiwi but decided to give them a second chance, off course I never should. They are really a discrace! This time I booked a plane ticket from Faro to Copenhagen. But, as life is dynamic, it turned out I had to move my flight up a week - called customer service, and was informed that changning my dates (exactly same times and flights) would cost me 141 euro!! That is 1,5 times the price that I originally payed for the ticket. 141 euros for what?? Pressing a few buttons. My frlight is 6 weeks away so they have plent of time to sell my old ticket. Robbery and terrible customer service! Never again kiwi!
4	I used <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> for my last minute ticket booking for an international trip. Must say the options that Kiwi scanned for me was unmatched elsewhere (tried skyscanner and others). Found it very easy to book as well. customer support on chat was good, although my only constructive feedback to them was to make the direct on phone service more efficient.Would recommend flyers to try them if not already done.cheersSoumya
5	Found the cheapest and most effective way to get from point A to point B and back. You can find options that no other dedicated and well known website has listed.
5	Thank you so much for your incredible help with plane rebooking due to cancellation of my flight earlier today! Kiwi agent Irina Zhuk was very helpful today because she did not leave me alone to deal with this situation :) Lots of thanks to the whole Kiwi com! Dekuju mockrat! - Ivan M.
5	I was glad to discover <http://SkyPicker.com|SkyPicker.com> in my South-East Asian trip, it was really helpful for a lot of reasons ; Ease to book tickets, availability of the staff, <http://SP.com|SP.com> insurances to ensure your flight... I was used to Skyscanner but <http://SkyPicker.com|SkyPicker.com> is way far more convenient ! Just one thing to improve ; the communication of the email adress with the company, so they can update in case of delay of the flights. A good beginner in this industry though :)
1	Our flight was changed. We understand that it was not skypicker who changed the flight, but as a company they did NOTHING to assist us with getting a flight that worked for us. They told us we lost that money and we would need to purchase new flights if we did not like the new time. We had an event to be in the area for and because of the time change we would have missed it. Most flight companies allow for changes when a flight time has changed drastically. I would never recommend skypicker.
5	Jonathan was a great help! Very friendly and solved my problem instantly. He got everything squared away and ready for my trip. Great customer service :)

5	Excellent!! Customer service is fantastic! Quick respond ...!
5	I wanted to update my passenger details online but there was no place for it on Manage my Booking. I phoned and was put in the queue and deicided to opt for the call back option. I was called back very quickly and was on the phone to Igor. He was extremely helpful and easy to talk to. He got everything done that I asked for, with no fuss. Great customer service from Igor. thanks
5	I got problem with the details on my ticket (different nationality). I felt nervous that time. First, I raised my concern through e-mail and I got the response after less than two hours asking me to send a copy of my passport in order to process the request for correction of my nationality. On the same day I emailed it, I called Skypicker local number to inform that I've sent it already. Enri Akhvlediani was the one who picked up my call and I told him about my problem. I had lots of queries about my flight and I am so grateful for having patience while giving response to my concerns. At first, I was a bit nervous because most of the time when I got to talk with a customer service personnel, some are not polite in answering questions. It seems that they don't like their job. In contrast, your staff, Enri Akhvlediani, is different. I can say that the company where he is working has the advantage of having him. I felt that he likes his job because he tried his best to provide ease with the client's feeling of being worried while looking for the best solution of the problem. He understands the clients' cultural diversity more specifically with language aspect because he is patience in repeating some words that I can't clearly understands. He tried to explain with a polite manner. Keep it up Enri Akhvlediani!!!!Continue giving quality service!!! God bless you and to Skypicker!!!More Power!!!
3	We tried to change our flight from Auckland - Christchurch to Auckland - Queenstown. Despite nowhere clearly saying the flights were non-refundable (it was in the small print in terms and conditions) we were told we had to pay full price for the second flights. I initially emailed them with the request to change flights but after an hour of not hearing anything, I opened chat with them. Three people later (who were all very rude and unhelpful), I eventually received an email confirming we could change flight. On the fourth person (Anton - who was brilliant), we managed to pay for the second flight. We are now desperately trying to sell the first set of tickets on Preloved, and despite asking have been given no advice on where we can resell the tickets or offered a refund/exchange.I am largely annoyed because everything else we had booked was refundable (flights, accommodation, hire cars etc) and it was not made clear that this wasn't, as I would not have booked it had I known. We were then treated really badly by three different people and this has taken a whole day (11am - 8pm) on my laptop and phone to 'resolve'. Nightmare. Still not happy but there's no more we can do.
5	We had a very good experience with kiwi and their client manager Mayyas. We got the help we needed immediately and we experienced the service as efficient and very positive. Thank you so much!
4	Natalya P. was a great agent, very helpful and kind; understanding of my problem regarding my booking cancellation.I am very happy with the way this matter is being handled.Thank you.
1	DO NOT FUCKING USE this agency ever, never in your life. They do not give u an airline reservation code for their fucking security policy which is not understandable, so u cant do a web check in or choose your sit. Plus they sent me a ticket by a wrong name and wrong sex information even though i entered correct information on their website, so i requested them to change and resend me but they send me a fucking link to pay a change fee. It is the WORST agency i ever had and they do NOT compensate you anything for their fault. Thanks FUCKING much for ruined my vacation MOTHER FUCKERS
5	I had a very good experience by contacting your agent via chat, my questions were answered very quickly and clearThanksMarc Luypaert
5	Skypicker has the best customer service ever, seriously no bulls**t, Kristyna handled my query politely and straight forward , to her manager : please give her an extra day off for a job well done, cheers
5	Good customer service. Miquel helped me with everything i needed. Thx Miquel
5	I was able to get the best flights at the best prices all without leaving the site, making it a much nicer, more cohesive experience than competitors. They even did my online check-in for me! Unbelievable stuff out of this young company.
5	As a matter of wrong name stated when ordering Kiwi provided 1st class service resulting in tickets with the right name. Thank you so much Michal & Anastasia for solving our problems.
5	Vendula was awesome. The mistake was on my end and she was patient and gracious about my stupidity.
5	@skypickercom skypicker holds information from their customers hindering them from being able to change their flights @skypickercom
3	It is convenient for <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> to check in passengers on their behalf but it is pointless if the passengers aren't sitting next to each other.Having flown with Easyjet on countless occasions, my partner and I have always sat next to each other and it was frustrating to see that this was not the case on our return flight.The booking details will show that two passengers have been booked on the one flight and whenever you check in with Easyjet, as long as you select 'all passengers', they should always be assigned seats next to each other.Given the flight is a week away, it is unlikely that two adjacent seats aren't available.
5	Had a problem with my passport and Yousseff was absolutely amazing at dealing with it.
5	A special mention to Samuel for he's efficiency. He was able to help me within seconds of connecting to the web chat. Will definitely book with Kiwi again!
5	Extraordinary service, quick and far more than I expected! My sincere recommendation. Very competent - I have been in contact with Alex Azaladze and Dmitry Dikalenko from the Skypicker Team. Please let them know my appreciation! Couldn't be better.
5	It was easy and fast to book a flight and I had no complications on the airport or in the airplane. It was enough time to change the plan and the airline was nice. Just the time I arrived was not so comfortable but no problem.
5	My girlfriends flight was redirected cause of bad weather and the problem that she was awared about it only during landing. But she had to transfer to another flight in 5 hours and she successfully missed it cause was in other city. First aircompaby didnt care about it. A second one said that can help but need wait for 2 days and also needd a letter from the first company that it wasn't passengers fault. But we couldn't wait cause had to marry and everything was booked. So only KIWI operators could help and provided new tickets. So i want to thank everyone who concerned my problem and helped me and my girlfriend(already my wife) that night. Special thanks to Anna, Guilherme, Jakub and unknown guy that called me from Czech Republic( thanks bro u really helped us). <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> is one of the most responsible service i ever tried. Good luck to all of you
1	I booked a flight via <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>. 10 hours after, i got a mail that the price was raised about 15 %.I booked the 2 flights my self around 150 € cheaper than the final price from Kiwi.NOT GOOD ENOUGH!
5	Very satisfied
4	I requested additional baggage allowance.  Consultant Igor Tarasuik was very quick to reply first although it took about 2 days to contact the airlines but I received quick email responses. Then consultant Cintia Schelbauer finalized the process in good time as well.
5	Ottimo servizio e estremamente gentilezza da parte dell'operatore Daniele
5	Very friendly and supportive staff. Many thanks to Karen A., Ondra P. and Jiri U.
1	This is the worst don't even try to book here this is the first and last time I do it
5	They did a great job of rearranging our flight when one that we had booked on got cancelled.
5	Very happy with how the whole system works and its overall reliability. Trust is the key word here, with easy-to-manage interfaces and clear conditions provided. Would strongly recommend.

5	I booked Skypicker for my trip from LA to Rome -- it offered by far the cheapest fare of everywhere I looked. I haven't taken the trip yet but already the service has been top notch. I contacted them a few days before my flight with concerns about the way I spelled my name on the boarding pass (it wasn't identical to my passport) and within a day they were able to get the name changed (for free!) with both airlines I'm flying and reissued me my boarding pass. Their customer service chatting tool has been available 24/7 and you actually are connected to a real person when it happens. Over the course of figuring the boarding pass out I was helped by Nina, Bartlomiej, Aliaksandra and Mohamed, all of whom were prompt, efficient and clear in their communications.
5	Mario Zarsky provided fantastic assistance and was able to resolve everything immediately over the phone. Thank you!
5	Had a problem receiving the email of my booking. Tamara helped me within a minute an the problem was solved!
5	"I recently purchased an air ticket for my wife using my amex card and it was declined due to the purchaser and passenger being different. I phoned the company and spoke with a representative named ""Vendula"" who help me to have this resolved.  I really appreciate Vendula's help as it was resolved so quickly and I was able to purchase the ticket for my wife. Thank you for your help Vendula much appreciated and thank you <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>."
5	I was very pleased to get assistance for booking the ticket and modifying invoice details. I would highly recommend! Alex was very helpful and also went me through the check-in process.
5	Many thanks, Emre! Very friendly service.Thanks again, you´ve just saved my life. (well, very nearly so :) )Great support from Emre, as above, competent, fast and friendlyThanks!
5	Thanks a lot for a quick service. Maria analysed and solved my problem in no time. I appreciate a lot!
5	and thanks to Tomas, he helped me very much, very nice and good guy! <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> - best company! I advice everyone to buy tickets here!
5	Very nice service. Even when I wrote them in German they tried their best to help me and used Google Translator. Also very fast respond.

5	jan's very kind of helped me a lot but you do not speak Spanish, could understand and help me with my questions, I also helped solve the problem.
3	But my ticket bought from Skypicker was from Kuala Lumpur  to manila  and from manila to Cebu.and here the problems started. The flight from Kuala Lumpur to Manila was about 2 hours late.. bad weather/Traffic congestions and so on. I warned Skypicker I would for sure lose my connection flight as  Manila Airport is a mess..and even connecting from one terminal to the other may take hours.Luckily enough also the second flight was two hours late.. and we could connect between terminals with a shuttle service of Cebu Pacific that runs inside the airport, is free and takes a few minutes, whereas the official shuttle service runs outiside the airport, costs 70 pisos, and may take <http://hours.In|hours.In> the meantime Skypicker had found a flight alternative, that we did not confirm as we could catch the previously booked flight. On the whole :Ticket bought without problems

4	My compliments to Yulia Volkova, Kate Opolonets, and Eliška Fojtíková - all of them have been helfpul and courteous. I particularly appreciated the detailed report back from Eliška Fojtíková about luggage allowances and seat allocation; please pass on my thanks. This is the first time that I have used Skypicker and I am pleased with the service. I do note that the seats on all flights have already been allocated for me and that because Skypicker has already checked me in, I cannot purchase an additional luggage allowance online with AirAsia; that is a problem for me but I presume that it is because the flight is so soon (the day after I booked). My previous flights with China Southern to Kathmandu were cancelled without notice so getting replacement flights within a day has been a very stressful experience for me - but Skypicker has made it possible. Thank you. My only feedback for improvement is that you allow the customer to be able to add a luggage allowance online - which I think means (at least with Air Asia) that the customer has to be able to manage their booking
5	very helpful in the live chat! Quick answers and patient. And not at least-nice.
5	I was stressed because my e-mail address was not the correctly and I could not receive my tickets and I communicated with Vendula and she helped me immediately! Very helpful person I really thanks her!
5	Just had a good experience with Neil, when web check-in for flight could not be done according to earlier info.  Flight is departing in less than 12 hours, and realised there is extra charge for airport check-in.  Neil's help was valuable in this moment of insecurity, and can now sleep calmly.
4	I was impressed with the professionalism and rate of response when I had a query. They helped me out a lot when I wanted to upgrade my baggage and was done so very swiftly. I will definitely book with them again
5	Fast and easy.
1	It has been 2 weeks .... Please act on this .Booking no 1408277 - please help us - I understand you work for the company but you do represent the company right? We simply ask for you to meet and exceed our expectations, not to mention - the refund is a big amount of money for a simple family like us.
1	One of the most rude customer service I've ever experienced. They can't even confirm my booking. Then I'm asking for a refund which they promised. They then said I have to wait and keep waiting. Glad to know I'm never using this service again as customer service was extremely unhelpful, and I'm disputing the charge on my credit card. Never use this service, stock to the big websites like Expedia and Orbitz. Beware of this website
1	Horrible refund policy after ridiculous scheduling changesAfter my Athens - Santorini flight was changed from 16:55 to 12:05 midnight prior, over 16 hours earlier, I was told it was not possible to refund my itinerary or provide a flight that was even remotely close to the original schedule (one was given at 8, 9 hours earlier than my original schedule). For travelers who have planned months in advance and booked expensive hotels at these nice places, it's irresponsible and ridiculous to expect customers to just abide by such drastic changes to their itinerary. When asked for a refund, they refused to refund the entire itinerary. DO NOT BOOK with them unless your schedule is flexible enough to change flight times by more than 16 hours. They won't refund your entire flight and you'll be forced to pay more to try to match a new flight to their itinerary and yours. Low-cost is not worth the unreliability of flights.
5	Just had a Chat with Gabi on Customer Care. Fast service and friendly. I will certainly use this booking site again.Thank you for everything
2	I paid for 2 suitcases but the airline did not have that information. I called Skypicker and was put on hold. When I got a customer rep, she told me to pay for the extra suitcase again and submit the receipt to be reimbursed. I am having a very difficult time getting onto the web site to even get an email to send the receipt to.
4	I had some trouble with my ticket being booked on a flight that didn't exist but the lady on the phone was extremely apologetic and they even offered to pay taxi fare if i needed to change terminals to switch planes. It took some time to get the problem corrected but they took care of me very well and I didn't miss my connecting flight. Would still use again, just double check the info.
5	I spoke to Eric he was great in answering all my questions. Great customer service thankongolu you!
5	Thanks a lot Natalia, as you solved my problem inmediately.My daughter is already 18 but she is not used to fly a lot and I wanted to be sure that she was having every single document.There was one missing and now she has it !All the best!
4	I recently had a bit of confusion with my booking and I contacted the online help. I quickly received help from a representative, David, through the live chat feature and everything was very quickly resolved. Very helpful :)
5	Skypicker is very good. When I had a problem an cheerfull assistant was here for help me ! thanks it's so cool
5	I have a good experience during live chat with Filip who is very helpful.
5	I had some questions pertaining to booking seats on flights for a future trip, so I contacted customer service. There response time was very quick with initiating the conversation and answer questions I had asked. The agent who helped me, Katerina G., went above and beyond my questions by searching for and obtaining aircraft layout information  for each flight to better allow me to make decisions on which travels plans to purchase. Katerina G. was highly professional and wonderful to communicate with. Thank you for all the information. I truly appreciate it!
3	Merci à gerome pour sont professionnalisme et sont aide
5	Flight booking process was seamless and easy. Staff were very responsive to my queries, and on live chat (Tomáš Jurík was my attendant and was very helpful). Thanks guys!
5	Very helpful and easy to manage. The customer support was very responsive and Sabi J. helped me recover my ticket information very quickly. I have had no problems booking with skypicker in the past and will continue to use them in the future.
5	When the first fright was delay, I could contact Kiwi member by chat. Since they arrange the alternative flight, I can back to Japan.
4	skypicker have found good flight connection at very resonable price
2	I would rather point out that :low cost airlines recommend at least 4 hours between connecting flights
5	I was (along with all the other passengers on board) unfortunately stranded in Bali for 2 days after the plane made 2 emergency landings...missed my transit flight and was all beaten up with worried and exhaustion. I contacted Skypicker staffs as soon as I was able to. By keeping in touch and receiving updates from the flight companies, Skypicker has efficiently arranged me another transit and within the day I got back on track I was able to board the plane to my final destination. Totally grateful with how patient the staffs had been regardless how many anxious customers they must had been dealing with at the time of that disaster... Cheers to you all!!!
5	Prices are really good. I could contact support literally anytime within a few minutes. Also, they do the check-in for you if you input your passport SN.
3	Saved 2 people from booking tickets from @skypickercom . Such scammers these guys are. All stay away. Don't fall in shitty skypicker trap.
4	My flight from Germany to the USA got cancelled by the airline - and this just 15 hours in advance. I got in contact with Vendula and she helped me out with a new flight connection and Kiwi promised me to send me a hotel voucher. In the end, I landed in Mexico one day later, but the Kiwi team helped me to make the best out of this situation.
1	Worst flight ever ! They lost our suitcases because skypicker booked two different flights instead of a connection flight ! No clothes and nothing for more then 4 days ! I surely don't recommend skypicker !
1	I wanted to a change destination.but Skypicker makes no change.Frequently asked questions in Skypicker's site.Is it possible to change my reservation?In general yes, changes to your reservation are possible. Changes can include a change of passenger, a change of destination or a change of date. Each of these options can incur further costs to your journey, costs are calculated on an individual basis and are case specific. If you wish to make any changes to your booking please log on to your account or review your flight details via the Manage My Booking section.We ask you to keep in mind that we work alongside several different airline carriers and each airline have their own rules and regulations. Therefore in some circumstances it can happen that not all options for changes are available to you.Should you not be able to make suitable changes via your account or Manage My Booking then please do not hesitate to contact our customer support team via the contact us page.why not???????I do not recommend Skypicke.
5	Online chat service was amazing, fast and helpful. Especially Sam, who sorted my name change and boarding pass issue in half hour and made it incredibly easy for me!life saver!! and also Anita for helping to begin with :) Amazing service!
5	I got a flight booking from <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> and misspelled my email wrong. However, there was Leonardo there to help me fixing my email and booking my flights. I appericate for the kind help and the service you support.
5	I got to the airport early in the morning just to find out that my flight had be canceled! I immediately contacted Kiwi and they quickly found an alternative (dare I say upgraded?) flight that would get me to my connection in time. Thanks to the Kiwi Guarantee, the re-booking was covered by them.I want to thank Dima Kondik specifically for his help when things got stressful. His professional, attentive, and good-humored approach was all that kept me from going crazy.Will book with Kiwi again!
5	excellent service. I have used live chat today (21.52) and even it is so late the agent helped me with my flight tomorrow. The lady`s name is sophiya g. she answered all my questions and even filled in my passport details. Thanks you very much. 5* service
5	I obviously booked our airline tickets with wrong e-mail address. Very nice Madam Natalya called me even twice, because the first time it was really bad connection, to check the right e-mail address, and take care of my tickets. This is very professional and passenger friendly service. Go on!
1	Worst experience ever. I buy 4 to 6 tickets per month, tried this site for the first and last time. Never before was I asked for so much documents. They cancelled my first flight, had to re book the same ticket, of course paid more, then asked for I'd copy, visa copy.... What if I am in my hotel room? Shall in buy a scanner? Will never use this again, and will never recommend it to anyone.
5	<http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> and Dmitriy Malitsky bring me an excellent and very helpful support
5	I was impressed how fast my request was solved online via the chat service. Special thanks to agent Tereza, who helped me issue the boarding passes instantly. Good job! Strongly recommended! Maria
5	Jan at the online chat was very helpful and efficient with dealing with my problem. Even though I missed the deadline for online check-in she did it for me. Very pleased.
5	Really happy with skypicker but mostly with the quick services provided! Thank you, Martin Carter for your help!
5	So far, my experience with Skypicker has been very positive.  Coordinating five flights from four airlines for a family of four is a nightmare (as far as schedules, seat reservations, luggage weight, et al. is concerned), but Pavel Fridrich in the Brno (Czech Republic) office has been outstanding: prompt to offer his help, quick in his responses, very able to understand the problems at hand, clear in his explanations, then detail-oriented and persistent in his repeated negotiations with Ryanair and Norwegian, courteous and personable ... and efficient and successful.  I had not expected this level of service.  5 stars seem deserved.
4	@adventurouskate Skypicker has an interactive map that lets you see how much flights cost anywhere in the world! <https://t.co/YuJNgCjAOH>
5	Very short booking process and very good journey
5	To (Phana)The problem was quickly resolved thanks to the friendly agent. I was worriedThank you very much.
2	A startup that finds discount flight tickets 'hidden' on airline websites just launched in the US <https://t.co/r6NmrL7Rrp>
5	A special thanks to  Mr Mohamed Abdelkader for his friendly support,  it went very quick and efficient Best Regards, Kawther
5	I had forgotten to write down the middle name in one of my bookings, so I brought my issue to one of the associates on Live Chat, Jiří Červenka. Very helpful, so easy and quick, made my experience with Skypicker very pleasant.
5	I had a refund process to deal with, and Lukas was really patient and super helpful just directing me and making sure that it was done and as soon as possible.Really happy with his service.
5	It was my first time, I had to use support, even twice with this booking. Once with luggages, how can I add a additional luggage and next time at the airport, when they wanted to add additional charge to my luggages :-)
5	I could not have been helped more by SASKIA and if i need help again i hope she will be there
5	Thanks, Miquel, for your help with my boarding passes. I've got them now.
5	I had a situation that Mrs.Ivana Vlahovic solved very fast and professional. I love Skypicker !
5	Excellent and quick costumer services! I will recommend you with my friends and family!PUPUT was my agent!!!
5	This company were very fast and happy to help when I booked my flights for the wrong day. They calmly replied and have helped re-organise my flights when I was freaking out. Thank you :)
5	Excellent customer service provided to me by agent Anas dallalI would like to thank flypickers and theire customer service  For the  good and satisfied and full information he provided to meIm more than happyThanks alot again fly pickers
5	Lucie Kambova was a beacon in a sea of garbage. I have dealt with so many rude and awful people over a hard three days and Lucie was amazing. Helpful and patient, she is this companies shining gem. Thanks for the help Lucie and good hire <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com>
4	I made a call because there is no terminal number on my flight details. Jaime was very helpful i got the answer i need within the time frame, that is a very responsible act. Though he kept on coughing on the phone and no proper holding time but i got the answer i needed and that is the most important thing. Thank you.
5	Helen was a great help when I needed information regarding the online check-in process. She helped me and patiently explained all I needed to know, and even followed up afterwards with sending the boarding tickets.Great service!
5	It's been a long time since i encountered such amazing customer service.Our flight to London was cancelled due to weather conditions, which meant we were missing our connecting flight to Dublin.Michala from Skypicker worked with us from 16:00 to 20:00, to find us an alternative flight to Dublin through Helsinki and a hotel for us to stay in (as the flight has a long layover). Everything was covered by Skypicker so we didn't have to pay a single cent. Whenever i have the option in the future, i will book with Skypicker.
5	Great service, all issues were solved quickly and efficiently. Thanks to Juan Costa :).
5	I've used this site several times and I got the best service you can imagine. Special thanks to Aura who helped me update my ticked with my new passport details and was really nice.
5	Customer service is extremely helpful and concerned. I had questions regarding visa requirements and baggage limitations. Mariya Potello called the airline company to find out the answers and called me back many times to inform about the details. I do not know how better it can be. Thanks skypicker, you guys will be very popular soon. Keep up the good work and thank you Mariya Potello for the excellent service.
5	Despite we had missed providing final info about passport and luggage, 12 hrs before departure, the service desk (by chat) solved everything very convenient. Even sent me the payment link over live chat and could also verify the extra payment for adding luggage. Very thankful.
5	I recently purchased a ticket through Skypicker. I found a really good deal and got an awesome customer service through support! Michael Angelo gave me a great service on the skypicker team chat line. I was really appreciative of his quick and efficient way of handling my online booking. I'll diffently use this service again and recommend it to friends and family.
5	My Boyfriend buy me the plane tickets trough Skypicker and I had to do the rest. There was a problem with the name's reservation but we found a very good response of the support team and they fixed our problem. The rest was so easy for me because everything is really well explained and I knew what to do at the moment my feet touch the airport floor. This was my first time travelling out of my country and my second time in a plane. Thank you skypicker for making my dream came true with your good service. I had a great time in London and I hope to return soon.
1	I made a booking from Singapore to Sydney that has a stop over in Bali. That cost me around 227 euros. Almost immediately after booking, I realize the date for the connecting flight was one later than I intended so I asked for a change of date immediately. SkyPicker asked me to pay 425 euros MORE for the change of flight time and said it will not refund me for the original amount I paid. How can the change in flight (425 euros) cost more than the two connecting flights I paid for (227 euros)? Meanwhile on SkyPicker's website, I see similar flight connections offered for no more than 250 euros. Total rip off
4	Have not been able to come across as a cheap a ticket as I have with Kiwi. Not only that, but a last minute request for extra baggage has been granted by an excellent employee, Anastassia. I am really impressed with customer service and plan on using <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> in the future,
1	Will not use them again because they are crooks.
4	I have contacted your Customer Support agent Tomas Jurik concerning changing flight date and baggage. He provided me with all relevant information and was willing to answer all of my questions. I am therefore highly satisfied and would recommend the company to my friends and acquaintances.
5	Great customer service! I gave them an incorrect email address and right away they called me to get this corrected. Thanks Lucy!!
1	"Woeful Experience from start to finish.I wouldn't be surprised if the ""good reviews"" are faked.Their ""dedication"" to please the customer is non existant. They know nothing about the routes, you can't check in online, lost bookings, terrible customer service and a general lack of empathy. When you take everything else into consideration this is NOT the cheapest option in any way shape or form."
4	un bon départ avec les bonnes correspondances, retour difficile avec un avion sur le tarmac sans carburant qui m'a fait louper toutes mes correspondance, bloqué a Londres, achat d'un billet pour retour chez moi, mais pas le bon aéroport, mais au final remboursement d'une partie des rais engagé, bon support dans ma langue maternelle anglais un peu hard du fait de sa non utilisation, je reprendrai mon prochain voyage avec Skypicker
5	Thanks so much to Vladimir for his help! Cheers
5	Olga was very kind and fast to resolve my problem.Very good.Thanks a lot
5	Received an amazing attention form Tomas on chatclient.Satisfied 100%
5	Operator Olga was quick and very helpful in sorting problems with Ryanair check-in. Overall great service so far.
5	i mistaked my surname and firstname. i was confused. but Aurelija helped me and i can change my name. thank you for Aurelija. she is very kind
5	I booked the tickets of Feb 6th from Tromso to Venice by doing transits in Oslo and London. Unfortunately,  my flight from Tromso to Oslo was delayed which resulted in that I missed my next flight from Oslo to London. Norwegian air arranged me to take the next flight to London. However,  I would missed my final  flight of Easyjet to Venice on the same day.  I made a phone call to KIwi  and Simon arranged me to take the earliest flight to Venice in next morning within one hour. He was trying to call me 4 times although I missed his calls due to the setting of silent mode in my mobile phone. Eventually, I picked up his 5th call and he was still quite friendly to tell me the good news of the arrangemnt. As English is not my mother tone, he remained quite patient to listen my request. I was very impressed by his service!
5	We were looking to book return flights in January, for a July family holiday (2 adults + 2 kid) in Lanzarote.Even booking that far in advance, the cost of direct flights from Dublin was coming in around €1900 on the Ryanair & Aer Lingus websites.Through this website we managed to get return flights for just under €1200, with a short stopover in Liverpool of 2-3 hours each way.That €700 saving went a long way towards our spending money while we were away, and they even checked us in automatically and emailed us our boarding passes!Great service.Highly recommended.We'll definitely use it again.Thanks very much.
5	The service of Skypicker is excellent and the consultants  very helpful, i am so glad that i got assistance from Mr. Martin Carter and he was very helpful and kind, i am grateful for you Mr. Martin Carter for you assistance :) Best wishes for you and for your team  ^_^
4	I forgot to order extra luggage to chek-in. I discovered pretty late, less that 24 h to my trip. A very polite and serviceminded employed man (name: Anas Dallal) helped me over the phone, so I managed to get some extra luggage with me anyway. I was very thankfull. Nice service!
5	thanks for the work professionally horoshoumI was pleased with the work of your storudnika thank you very much for your help
5	Agent Mohammed was very good in helping me today, thank you very much
5	Had a problem with my e-mail and Eszter was really helpful, fixed it in no time. Brilliant customer service.
5	I was so confused when i tried to change my flight schedule.but Kira help me to solved everything.Thanks kira
4	I wasn't able to book seats for my flight back to London from Copenhagen on Ryanair for me and my daughter. I'm happy to say the issue has been sorted and would like to say thank you for the response and how you have dealth with this.
5	Thank you to Greame, who answered all my weird questions and more, great service and super fast. xx
1	I had a problem with my ID - the site got my birthdate as ID expiracy date, when I tried to change it, it was not possible on its website. I e-mailed the responsible on kiwi(dot)com, because I was not checked in due to this ... they got back to me one hour before my flight (I was already on the airport) ... but they didn't issue me a boarding pass. I was only able to get on the plane if there were empty seats and had to pay around 50€. Kiwi(dot)com called apologizing me and saying they would get my money back ... but now they're making my life hard when it comes to getting my ~50€ back.
5	Babak at their Customer-service was very helpful.
5	Having troubles with doing online check in is not a problem at all, cause there's always somebody to help you. In my case, it was Tatevik that solved my problem. Now I feel better.  I can travel in peace, thanks to Tatevik.

3	Skypicker is a crapy agency, i booked ticked whit Wizzair whit Skypicker and the agency woman cansell my ticket and i need pay new ticket and get 1 night in Gdansk it cost me extra 150 euro so Skypicker NEVER again !!!!!!!!!

5	Great flights and great customer service from Irina at the online chat :) thanks for the help
3	@elliottdotorg Also, you can save by booking connecting flights among unaffiliated airlines which <https://t.co/6MN8N4GW19> can do for you.
5	I didn't receive e-ticket.but Alice W. help me and send it.I am very impressed with her help.My English skill is terrible so I can't compliment her fluently.But she is truly kind.
5	Skypicker were upfront about what currency their prices were in and how much they would cost. When we had to change our dates and destinations of our flights we had a very helpful customer service lady who quickly and efficiently did that for us and clearly told us how much it would cost.
1	I was flying from Tokyo to Kolkata with layovers in Bangkok and Kuala Lumpur. <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> booked my flights under separate reservations. This means that I have to get out of the international arrival terminals at every stop and then get into the departure terminals. If a reservation has 3 different reservation at each leg why the heck I need a travel agent for? I can book those myself from the airline websites separately! I had to get on arrival VISAs for Bangkok and Kuala Lumpur to get to the departing flight! The whole time I was running and freaked out! Think about getting an on arrival Visa when your connecting flight departs in less than an hour. Not to mention pay more than 300$ for the Visa fees!!!!! NEVER EVER book flights with this agent!!
4	The service provided by Eric via the 24hrs hotline is very helpfull, and can fix most of the problems regarding tickets and booking.

5	The Agent was very kind and helpful during all the service, she/he resolved my problem/doubt and made sure I felt satisfied.I ended up happy with the result of the service :)Thank you very much Nizar :)
5	"I had a very special request to change my booking. Even if this service is not officially provided by <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> I tried to contact customer support. I was expecting something like ""Sorry, we do not provide such service"". I was totally amazed by the agent's willingness to help me. His name was Viktor P. He was working hard to find a solution for me and at the end he was successful. Thanks to him I can fly in the way I wanted. Thanks Viktor, I really appreciate your effort."
5	Eugene Dergunov is one of the best customer support representatives at Kiwi. Even though we could not resolve the main issue due to certain restrictions of some crappy airlines, this guy stayed on top of his game and provided an outstanding customer service.
5	Great company, and great service. They handled my travel and requests quickly, and efficiently.
5	I was assited by  Martin Lauer. I told you that your assistance is very kindness and I can see that you make us fell like persons, not machines. I know that every one has a lot of things to do, but congratulations also you have a great quality of God, this is thoroughness. You try to help us in every details. I pray God that bless you. I am from El Salvador a little country, the most little of all the americas (North, South and Central America, but we have a big heart; I fell that you assisted me with great consideration. The Bible says that if you do one thing for a little man, you are doing it for Him (the Lord).Have a good WE, Thank you Kiwi
5	5 Stars to <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> for their good service and especially the employee Eva O. Who helped me in a very good Way! It makes your Day so much better to be greeted with joy! :-)
5	Lukas M. was the person who took care of my problem, and he not only resolved it but also got to improve my reservation. Thanks a lot for an excelente service!
5	Today has been a frustrating day to say the least. My flight was delayed... and then we were told we would not get to fly today. It was frustrating, as I called the airline they told me they would not provide me with a refund for my loss. I decided to deal directly with <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com>, as they are the agency that I had booked with. The first agent was great, as she found a new itinerary for me for the following day, and it wouldn't cost me any additional money. I was definitely happy to hear that. Before heading to bed, I was getting a little anxious as I still had not received my e-ticket. I spoke with an agent by the name of Tomas Jurik. He was amazing! He assured me that sometimes it takes a bit of time, but he would personally be on top of things. Furthermore, I had explained my situation regarding losing my accommodation, and he provided me with the appropriate information needed to seek reimbursement. I normally hate doing live chats as they take forever, Tomas was so quick to answer my questions, however, and was straight to the point. <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> is a new site to me, however, after my dealings with their agents today, I would not book a flight with any other agency. I plan to tell all my friends and family about this company, as I was floored by them today. I hope they follow through on what was promised! Thanks Tom and everyone else at Kiwi!
5	Patrik was a great help on live chat thanx!!
5	I just would like to thank Victor for the excellent service and support. Very efficient  and also very kind... I would recommend Skypicker

5	Truly remarkable customer service specially from lucie and kristina !!!! Thanks for all
1	If you need to cancel your ticket with this airlines call your bank and tell them to cancel the pending charges.  I purchased a ticket for $718 from <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> and immediately realized that baggage was not included.  I called within five minutes after making the reservation that I needed to cancel.  The representative was nice and told me that she would contact the airlines to make sure that my purchase would be fully refunded.  She called me back and told me that my purchase would be refunded within two weeks.  Two weeks passed and no refund.  I contacted my bank to dispute the charges and my bank refunded me the full $718.  Two days after the dispute was filed <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> refunded me $526 (not to the bank).  After some difficulty I was able to locate <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> contact information in the US.  When I was finally able to reach <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> I was told to call back the following day.  When I did call back I was put in touch with a manager.  The manager stated that he would not be able to refund the full purchase price because the phone recording made by the representative that promised the refund was not available.  However, he noted that I had been overcharged fees and would be that he would be adjusting the fees from some $200 down to $71.  Unless I file a fraud charges there is little I can do to get my money back and to be honest it isn't worth my time.  My bank offered to cancel the charge while it was still pending but I trusted the company's word to give me a full refund.   I strongly advise to avoid doing business with this travel agency.
5	"As a new person to Kiwi, flying Spirit, I had many questions.  I ""spoke"" with OLGA via Live Chat re: seating and booking issues.  Olga was kind, patient, and knowledgeable re: my questions. I would highly recommend this service for other travelers with questions.  Especially if they are fortunate enough to speak with Olga!!!!"
5	Bogdan C. was very kind and effective in solving my issue with the flight.In less than half an hour he call back with a very effective and very convenient solution for me.
5	Naomi and Dominika are great service representatives.  They went above and beyond!  If your company had more employees like them, I am sure your company would be better off and more successful.Happy Holidays Naomi and Dominika!
5	I received an email a few days before my flight informing me that I have to do an online check in or I would be subject to additional costs. Unfortunelty, I didn't see the email until after the 72 hour grace period. When I tried to check in, the airline wouldn't allow it. I was also traveling with two children and there were no seats availible for all of us in a row. I called Kiwi customer service and spoke to Adam Jelinek who was incredibly helpful. He check my kids and I in and got us seats in a row. He even said it may take a moment and that he would call me back. He did! Within 5 minutes he had everything ready to go. He was great! Thanks Adam! 2,342,486
5	kiwi have  very good ghat service. they solve my problems just in one minute. I want to mention the operator who helped me: Katka(I hope, I not missed up name) I'm very satisfied. 5 stars.
5	great service! Nathalia has helped me in everything!
5	Helpful and good customer service attitude.
5	Recently i booked tickets to kota kinabalu. i didnt receive the tax invoice. i needed it to place the claim at office. today i contacted your customer care today via chat.

5	Excellent service from Lucie F.!!! She help me a lot with all my doubts about my flight and she took time to search and answer every question. Nice service :)
5	Had a very helpful conversation with Tomas Krivanek. He showed tremendous amount of patience. Provided me with very helpful information regarding the on-line check-in.
5	The service was great and fast, Tomas U helped me and answered all of my questions very kindly and patiently, and everything worked out great. I have no complaints about the customer service, 10/10!
5	I want to say a big thank you to Martin Carter that helped me solve my problem with my ticket and to the company for having the online chat conversation :)
5	Easy, intuitive and fast to book. I would recommend to every discerning travellers who want to spend their time & money on their destination rather than on an headache of a booking nightmare.
5	Very good prices, easy reservation process. I have also some requests after flight regarding invoce. Everything was solved very quickly and according my requests with Zora. Perfect customer service.
5	Hello,This was my first experience with Skypicker and I wasn't sure about the quality of their services but in the end they proved me their are a trustworthy company and i will be happy to come again and use their expertise for my following trips.I had some questions about my luggages and they replied to me very fast, even in my language. So i really appreciate the effort and all the information they gave me.I had really good seats, window seats, the checkin was already done and the tickets arrived on time.Everything was perfect, I highly recommend them.Have a nice day,Ana
1	"I can REALLY NOT recommended this company! My pregnant wife and I had booked a flight home from Sicily to Copenhagen through SkyPicker and the travel that should have taken 6 hours ended up taken 40 hours (!) with a HORRIBLE alternative route offered by the SkyPicker ""Service"" team.We had to spent to extra nights in Airport Hotels and did NOT get all our hotel costs covered! Worst part of it all is that we did lost two working days and did not get the most BASIC costs covered like transfer costs from one airport to another in London even though we chose the cheapiest form of transportation (train). The company state on their website that the ""GUARANTEE"" transfer costs up to 100 Euro from airport to another - but we got NOTHING!When trying to arrange a alternative route there was an EXTREMELY POOR SERVICE LEVEL and LONG response time. I had to call their ""service desk"" 7 times (!) and go through annoying safety clearance questions EVERY SINGLE time and a new staff member EVERY SINGLE time which I had to explain my situation to.In general, I am SO DISSAPPOINTED with this company and their customer ""service"" level! We ended up spending 40 hours, 2 nights in airport hotels, lost two working day and we did NOT get the most basic costs covered..."
1	I have the fly today and i dont have the tickets, i have tree days calling and no one do anything
1	I have never had such a poor and frustrating experience with a company! If you value your time, money, and sanity avoid <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> and NEVER book a ticket via their website. See below for full story: I used <http://Kayak.com|Kayak.com> to plan a flight from San Francisco --> Madrid with a stop in Dublin. After selecting the dates and times, <http://Kayak.com|Kayak.com> referred me to affiliate websites to book the tickets. I was able to successfully book two legs of my journey without any issues. However, for my return flight back to San Francisco I was sent to <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> - THIS IS WHERE THE ERROR OCCURRED. Instead of the simple flight with one connection in Dublin that I selected, I was somehow booked on a 28hr flight with 4 connections that sent me to Italy, Lithuania, and Iceland! NO SANE PERSON WOULD EVER SELECT THAT FLIGHT! I immediately realized the mistake when I received the flight confirmation. I called <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> (at my own expense, because it was an international phone call), and spoke to a customer service agent. They were very nice and apologetic and said they would look into the issue. I told them in the mean time, if they could update my flight to the correct flight I selected, that would be best. They said they were unable to do this. I then asked them to cancel my flight completely. Two days and countless phone calls later, I was told they could not refund my ticket because the airlines they MISTAKENLY booked me on are non-refundable. Only one flight would be refundable for 32Euros. The full price of my ticket was $456USD. It is now 12 days later and I have not received any refund, not even the 32Euros I was promised. Today, 12 days after the flight should have been canceled I received two SMS messages and an email directing me to supply <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> with my Passport information, otherwise I would be charged an additional fee. THIS IS ABSURD. Why would I be charged an additional fee if the flights were canceled as I had asked?I am still waiting on a refund, and worried I may never see my hard-earned money back. I have also been treated incredibly poorly by Kiwi's customer service team, as it refuses to acknowledge that their website made any error. I recommend customers avoid using <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>, especially if you are linked there from a different, perhaps trust-worthy website. <http://KIWI.COM|KIWI.COM> IS A SCAM.
5	Just had a conversation with Lenka with regards to meals on an Air Asia flight. Excellent communication and service. Cheers!!
5	I needed help with my boarding passes and with finding out how much the extra hand luggage should weigh, and Emre T. did a great job in prividing me with that information.I had doubts whether he was human or not, but given that he was so patient and kind, he must be.Best of luck to y'all!
5	kindly cancel this booking td: 342860
5	We are totally satisfied thanks to very easy and fast booking proceedure and then finding all of the information needed in the e-mail. Very easy and very comfortable service with no complications.
5	I heartily recommend the kiwi. I got great service. Customer service is very kind and helpful. Thank you
1	"I had to curtail my traveling due to personal circumstances, my original flight home was non-transferable, non-refundable and there was no facility to pay a fee or difference in cost of booking a new flight. This flight was $467 US. I will admit I don't remember seeing these terms and conditions explicitly stated at time of booking however I did not look for such terms either. I was then informed I could use the change of flight option, which offered a flight change for £475 GBP on top of what I had previously paid. I then checked a stand alone booking of same flight on their website and this was £25 cheaper however the friendly online chat representative had told me the £475 was the only option. As I was in a country with censored internet I then waited for the new flight confirmation as I was to leave within 48 hours of booking. This did not arrive however my card had been debited the £475. I requested an invoice to ensure I had proof that a transaction had occurred and that I was due a route home. I did not have access to internet until much later that day, the day before I was due to fly. When I did, I received an email telling me I had been charged £475, but that the flight I had chosen was unavailable and was provided with 2 options which I would not have to pay more or receive money back for. This I believe is completely ridiculous that they do not provide the true cost of the options they provide. Under the circumstances, short notice to get home and poor internet access I chose the option that would get me home quickest and did not contest the lack of a true value of the actual flights I was getting. I arrived to check in 1 bag for the first of the new 3 flights - which was requested and paid for in the original $467 dollar flight AND also detailed as paid for in my £475 new flight e ticket however the airline had no record and I was forced to pay $25 US to check this in or leave my belongings behind. I have since been online chat to a rep and have been assured I will be refunded when I forward the receipt to their office. But this level of incompetence is not acceptable. I am just off my first flight in which I spent over 4 hours with a nervous cabin crew and one in particular before we landed. As we stood to take our overhead baggage we were informed we would need to present passports leaving the plane, to which a native of the country replied, ""this never happens"". I waved goodbye to the cabin crew and thanked them as I stepped off the plane, after which the cabin crew signalled to 3 airport security immediately positioned outside the plane door of my indication and identity. I was stopped, questioned, escorted away from the other passengers, through a separate immigration area and to the immigration office. After explaining myself with emails, medical credentials and now numerous e tickets and flight details they informed me my details were not registered for that flight, the name was incorrect/completely different, they said they had no record of me being on the flight and after they had seen it was booked within 3 days previously they were alerted that this passenger was suspicious to them. I am tonight exhausted and overwhelmed at what has happened to me, that I've paid over $1100 dollars to get halfway home at this point and with only ""sorry"" being offered from <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> for a complete rip off and shambles of a service and evidently incompetent staff in some departments. I have spent £30 on Internet access fees to contact the online chat teams for all of the reasons above. I wholeheartedly will never use your company again. I cannot believe there has been no flicker of humanity in considering my case for exception to the terms or no senior input or response into acknowledgement of how badly my whole experience has been handled. This is a true example of a complete system's failure at every level of interaction. The entire fiasco has left me financially robbed, humiliated publicly and mentally and physically exhausted."
5	Nice service, cheap prices, had no issues during the flight
5	I am satisfied with the kiwi and the people who work there. Thanks for your help today Alice

5	great service, they check in for you and send you the boardingpass, speciell thanks to Tomas Krivanek for his great help and service! =)
5	The lady on the phone was very patient with me.  She was quick, kind and helpful so I don't have to worry about the check in anymore. Nice!
5	Excellent service - great agent, great help.I was talking with agent Mirosla 3-4 days ago.He was very patient and helpful. He was also very friendly and professional at the same time.
5	Yevheniia K., the Travel Consultant, was very prompt and supportive via email!
5	My first time using Skypicker. The booking process was very easy and smooth and the price was very good. After booking my flights literally 12 hrs or so I had to cancel my booking due to an unfortunate event. I e-mailed Skypicker immediately as i was worried that I would lose my fare. However I received a prompt reply from Skypicker assuring me that I would receive a full refund due to the short time lapse and were very considerate. I won't receive the refund for 3-4 weeks but if they are true to their word I will certainly be using them again. Thanks for understanding Skypicker.Jimmy
5	Fast, effective and nice :) what else ?
5	Hello! Having never heard of KiWI through a search on momomdo decided I more a friend to book the flight through these . very tempting prices . And we risk not we could have taken better decision. He ran all the best. Check -in always done on certain dates as they had said . In only time I needed to clarify doubts because I could not open the boarding pass , all decided very quickly by sending in a short time a new email with the boarding pass in proper conditions. I can only speak well of all in special team of Veronika that was the one that dealt with this issue of the ticket. I hope to have good experiences with KIWI. Thank you.
5	This company is very great, First if you have need they reply of istant!!! thank You...The next time i do still this company.Questa compagnia e molto valida, appena ho avuto bisogno di informazioni hanno risposto all istante, sicuramente nel prossimo viaggio chiamero di nuovo loro!!!! It's OK....
5	two connecting flights, when first flight was delayed and the connection was missed, <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> rapidly found a solution and booked another flight in order to reach my destination that day, highly appreciated.If I was to book independently of course no one would be held responsible for a lost connection but me.Thank you!
1	This company has a horrible system for customer service. I am unable to make a flight I booked months ago, and I have been trying to contact someone about canceling or changing the date of my ticket. I am a member of the US Army National Guard, and I was recently given orders that requires me to stay on my unit throughout the entire month. I spent 1300+ dollars on a ticket, and now I can not go and this company has done nothing to help me with my situation. Everyone I speak to on the support phone lines are difficult to understand, and they don't understand half the things I tell them. I should not feel punished for an obligation I made to my country, and I would not recommend this company to anyone.
5	It was the first time that I've heard of sky picker and I was a bit skeptical. It was a great surprise, extremely good service for a great price. If sky picker keep the good service, they have just got a costumer for life. Thanks for the good deal.Kind regards from Denmark.
5	Thank to Aliaksandra and Alikhan! Thay was very helpful, resolved my issue very fast!
5	The price was great and the booking process was straight forward and easy. Customer service was extremely quick to respond to all my inquiries and were super helpful.The automated online check in done by Skypicker was great as well - very efficient. Overall I'm very satisfied with the entire booking and flights processed by Skypicker and would recommend them to my family and friends.
5	I just have good works for you. :)
1	"I booked a flight with my partner for the 23rd of December 2016 to get a confirmation email saying that it was actually booked on the 23rd of January. I contact Kiwi in mininutes to try and change the issue before it was processed. I was place on hold for 20 minutes before they finally told me there was nothing they could do and if I wanted to change the flights it would cost $1700, ridiculous. I then spent two hours this morning speaking with someone who placed all the blame on our end, disputes our efforts to cancel the booking prior to processing. The gentleman told us that he would ""get fired"" if he helped us. Ridiculous. Never going to use Kiwi again and make sure no one in my circle does. Do not use this website. They are just interested in money, not helping their customers."
5	I mistook checking my sex. Despite of female, I checked ''male''. I was panicked... I asked LIVE CHAT how I could correct it. Anna S who is the member of the support team kindly explained what I have to do, so I could receive the confirmed mail. Furthermore I asked her my other questions, she always kindly answered me. I really appreciate her kindness!
5	Tamara thank you for your excellent service and help.
5	I had a problem with a flight from Paris to LAX. I couldnt find another cheap flight to fly back. Chat Support team (Especially Viktor) help us book another flight asap. I really appreciate the support! TY!
5	I had forgotten to add the extra luggage to my booking and I could not add it online, so I called customer service. The person who helped me solve this matter was very professional and Very efficient. So, thank you Vendula, T.  It was a pleasure speaking to you. Best regardsL. Hökson
5	Easy to work with, everything was arranged and that was done at the best price for me.

4	I used skypicker out of Vietnam recently. I was worried I was buying far too cheap, fake tickets even though I had read good reviews here, but all my flights were booked and available! All my bookings I was told I needed to do online bookings to avoid paying extra when checking in and dropping off bags. I read through their privacy policy and then went ahead, hoping my printed boarding passes would be sufficient. I still needed to check in at the desk but there was no fee. All the live chat messaging I had with the company while being moderate english, were efficient and helpful. They've done me well! It does say in their policy that most of the flights are non-refundable so if that could be an issue you have I'd check very thoroughly first to avoid losing money. But overall really, really happy with their service and the outcome! Thanks guys!
5	Rapid feedback and very helpful personell. Highly recommended for other users.
5	It makes it easy to search for flights to the destination and nearby. So far, all went well, always. Easy nad without any problems every time. I used the service 4 times so far.
5	Great price and easy booking process. Other members of our party who booked separately actually had to fly home before us because they hadn't been able to find suitable flights! So easy to manage the online check-in too! All in all, very pleased!
5	Recomend
2	This startup has an algorithm that finds discount flight tickets 'hidden' on airline websites <https://t.co/0FvB0pprMb>
5	I was in trouble with loading my booking info so I called online chat. Fortunatelly, very friendly agent - Radim - helped me a lot. We were also contacting IT that gave me immediate response. Thank you Radim for your fast response and fixing my problem even if was a bit harder. Best customer support.
4	I made a mistake of choosing the salutation and it was solved within a minute. Thank you, Lucie F :) Best Regards, Wilma Fedora
5	Very good site and good support in case of problems with a service available at any time, my interlocutor Lucine was able to help me as it should. Very well, nothing to say
5	Amazing algorithms choose best routes and fees for you. Following the most attractive prices on the market you will profit from an amazing customer service.
5	Thank you Martin Carter for the follow-up.
5	So I forgot to send my passport information to kiwi. I was really concerned that it would be a major problem so I contacted the support through the live chat . My Supportagent was called lukas and to keep it short that was my best online support experience ever!!!
4	"Dear <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> manager; I would like to thank for customer service agent ""Lenka"" for the guidance and explanation. It  was so helpful and entertain my problem with no delay. their instructions also easy to followed and make it easier for me to settle my problem."
5	RT @tloilier: Was a huge fan of @skypickercom until today. They show cheap prices but this is an illusion when checkin out... <https://t.co/>…
1	I booked a roundtrip flight from LAX to PDX. The price listed on <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> was 118 dollars. I booked the flight and shortly thereafter I received an email stating my booking was unsuccesful and I must pay an extra 37 dollars to complete the booking I contacted Kiwi and they told me they double booked the seat and the airline changed the price to 156 from 118. I needed to get on this exact flight so I spent hours on the phone with several different representatives and someone who claimed to be a supervisor. They all explained that because more time had elapsed since my booking, I would have to pay an even higher price in order to keep the original flight. They did offer a refund but offered no solution for their mistake. The represenatives and the supervisor all explained the prices on their website are not always updated and prices may be higher than listed if the airline chooses to raise the price. This is an unacceptable practice. How are we supposed to trust a company that falsely advertises prices to sucker in customers?
5	It was my first trip abroad and my first time with SkyPicker, and  I'm very happy with the treatment received.I'm looking forward to travel again.
1	I am informed that the flight is cancelled, however, no alternative flight is offered which could be applicable.After asking 5 times (!) to return the cost no reply.Messages are just ignored.Fraudsters! Keep yourself away.Don't believe 5 star rankings!
4	We ordered a flight ticket for our new au pair thorugh Skypicker. Unfortunately she was not able to reach her connecting flight from Kuala Lumpur to London. Skypicker was not able to find a alternative for her and she was stranded in Kuala Lumpur for several hours until we managed to book a new flight for her ourself. However we eventually got a refund for this new ticket so the overall we rate it 4 stars. Bottom Line - if anything goes wrong, expect to sort it out yourself and always remember to have documentation at hand.
5	I booked a trip home for the best price at the moment. Really saved my life! All reservation staff was very helpful and friendly re: additional luggage, check in, etc. Pleasure to deal with!
5	Dear Marie Fiserova,I would like to thank you personally quite warmly for your big help, your excellent service, your great performance and your reliability. Indeed: I never found an employee of a Call Center with this special manner you demonstrated in our telephon call yesterday. You attended me as a real customer you seriously have respected my customer wishes. That's splendid. Your enterprise <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> can be proud to have you as its employee. With pleasure I will buy my next ticket with <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> and it would be great to have you again as my travel consultant. I wish you all the best and please remain so friendly and customer-oriented as you are :-)Kind regardsAndreas Schloetterer
5	I really find that the service is awesome!!! Really fast booking and clear informations.
5	great customer service! on the spot and fast :) Thank you!
5	Monika was an angel today. When I arrived at the airport to find my flight had been changed without the airline notifying me. She had me booked on another flight within the hour. She kept me calm and organized. I couldn't of asked for a better experience considering the frustration of the change. Thank you for all your help.
5	I did make chat with agent and he was helpful and respectful and he help me and he try to do everything to solve my problems .. Thanks David, and Thanks <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>

5	Very polite travel consultant (Vendula) Help me a lot.
4	I had an issue with my flight back from Paris to Naples (Italy) they were so helpful giving me right advices and changing my flight.Thank you so much!
5	Thank you, Miguel for helping me to finish my booking process. Just now the boarding pass are in my mailbox.
5	Had to reschedule my flight and was so well received by the customer support! Over their chat I could contact and get help from Yuliya S. She was really great and so helpful! Perfect service!!
3	I messed up my booking, but Brice Hairon quickly find it out and fixed the issue and I got the booked e-tickets. very happy with the service. I will surely use <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> again!
1	Terrible first and last experience with Kiwi. I was really excited to use Kiwi since I recently discovered it and believe you have a great flight search algorithm. Unfortunately, even though I booked my flight earlier than other people I’m traveling with, my price was changed and theirs was not. When I called, I expected some sort of help from the customer support but I wasn’t given any and instead given a long explanation of what could be done that in the end would not change anything. I even got a better price booking directly with the airline! Incredible! I expected more equal treatment. Very unfortunate.Thanks,Ryan
5	Filip was great!
5	I have forgotten to Check-in on time and in less than 24 hours before my flight I remembered, so I contacted Skypicker. Neil was very kind to help me and in just 10 minutes, I had my boarding passes. Thank you so much, Neil !! :)
5	Aamer was great! Really helpful and polite. I wanted to add baggage and he helped me through each step and called back each time to make sure I received all the correct information. I was very happy with the service I was given.
4	I had troubles with my check-in and the customer service helped me to manage it for 2 min. Thanks Neil for the fast response!
4	I used the Skysicke for the first time and it was good to see how easy and without any problems all things were going. I'm sure I'll use Skyspicker again! Thank you!
5	I have never had an easier time booking a flight. I actually thought there must be more to it, but the flights were cheap, communication was clear and I had to do very little legwork.One minor thing that isn't covered in their documentation is that you can usually just download your boarding passes to your smartphone and scan the barcode at the airport, no real need to print them off, although you can do so for peace of mind.
5	The chat function through Skypicker is great and very easy to use!!!  Their agents are super friendly and make it quick and easy to resolve your issue.  I am very happy with Natalya and her amazing customer service.  I am one satisfied customer!!!
5	I had some problems due to a late flight, Skypicker helped me extremely fast and efficiently.
5	I live chat with Lenka and she was very professional, helpful, courteous and friendly she helped me so much with my problem and is a credit to the company and can't recommend this service enough and has enabled me to have peace of mind
5	It was very helpfully, quick.I am satisfied with the service they provide.I would like to give a 5 stars to Tamara, the representative who helped me.Best regards,Nadem Said Marstawi
3	@Skyscanner skypicker bringing the standard down
5	So easy to book a flight and a car on this site.  When I had an issue I called customer service. Simon was very friendly and had my issue resolved very quickly.  I will book with Kiwi again.
4	Without any cost my name was changed on the booking. It wasmy fault and they helped me very well to solve iT. Thanks
4	I had very good support from live. chat support service agent: lorena galloshe was very supportive and clarified all my questions.
5	Thanks to Tereza P.
1	The worst user experience I've ever have had.
1	I regretfully purchased two itenery from this company assuming that they have excellent customer service supposed to be better then book direct with the airline. I am currently on my honey moon and have visited langkawi we loved it here and want to extend our stay so called all my other flights have changed my flight dates hence we flighing to multiple places and thank god we did not book all through this rubbish company anyways every flight was changed hassle free and just the minor fees paid once contacting sky picker I was rudely spoken to and never got a response for 2 days once I received the response that pretty much to bad you either fly or loss ur money I go to book other flight I found with someone else price of flight went up so over all they make me lose my money on the flight I booked with them and pay more then I should have if they had a decent customer service on my new flight ..Rubbish experience will never fly with these so called travel mate again absolutely rubbish be very careful !!!
5	Trustable webpage with very efficient search engine and automatic check in. Good costumer service and communication.I'll definitely use it again.
5	I really appreciated the service - instant chat, very helpful agends and clear answers
5	I contacted Kiwi on chat online, i had a problem with my booking and i could solve it the best way. I had to pay, though, but the person who assisted me (3 times) was very helpful and willing to solve my problem the best possible way.  And indeed, we solve it.
5	thank you so much Eleonora to help me check in~otherwise i have to pay so much for the extra fee to check in at the airport~really helpful
5	Tomas and Jakub let me very satisfied.I want to find their next service.I will find the next <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> booking tickets.
5	Skypicker and NINA in their customer service arranged in one and a half hours a new and better flight to replace a cancelled flight. Very thankful,Hannele
5	Overall had a great experience. I booked holiday travel for my family, good prices, communication, and convenience through the app. Not a hitch during travel, which was impressive since we needed to make several connections. We had an issue with check-in on our final itinerary, but customer service helped us out without missing a beat. Definitely will be recommending Kiwi.
1	I bought two plane tickets for two friends on 12/08/16 they take the money out of my account. Nown I just get to notice that they going to send the money back to my account. After 10 days they never call to tell me that they cancel the transsaction so we don't have plane tickets. They suck a week before I try to cancel one plane ticket and they didn't let me. They don't give you no options. I will never buy a plane ticket from this website again.stay away
5	I am very content with the contents of this site and online service, No hidden costs with visa card paying, Very satisfied with the 24/7 support team service, Keep up the good work, will definately use again and again, and will not hesitate to recommend it to other people i know. :-)thanks Perv Q.  :-)
5	The best call support I ever had!! <3 :) :D You are perfect skypicker!
5	I had a very short check-in window from the website which I did not meet, and was afraid of check-in fee at the airport. Lenka did the check-in for me in a matter of few minutes. The procedure was painless and friendly. Great customer support!
5	Just had great and swift assistance from Saskia at <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>. Answered my questions immediately and with apparent knowledge. Great company great employee. I wish every online platform would act like this!Saskia's boss: give her a raise!
5	I have discovered Skypicker via Skyscanner because I wanted to book a multi-destination trip in 5 different countries, and it really had the better price then the companies combined (and also much easier to book). The whole process was clear, I received promptly all the documents and every single update of my flights. When I had a doubt about one company, the customer service was great (even replied in Portuguese!). 5 stars. Looking forward for the next trip.
3	@skypickercom Well, I still need to purchase a return flight. May be I'll get travel insurance for those tickets!
4	Had very fast and helpful online chat with Yuriy N.
5	I've been trying to change my book/help with my booking but every single online chat I've talk to tells me to go online which I've tried doing. came across Lucie K and she has been more then helpful. she helping me right now and going a great job (: definitely give her a pay rise :D
5	I booked a flight on <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> because after some researches it was the cheapest I found. Then, I had a problem with my booking so I used the live Chat. The agent Anastassia responded to me and did a very great job to help me. She solved the problem within 2 minutes and was very kind. I highly recommend this website and i'll use it again.
5	I would highly recommend <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> to my friends should they need assistance with their travelling needs. I needed to upgrade my baggage allowance and both Mr David Blazek and Mr Edoardo P. has been very helpful and attentive to my needs.Thank you very much <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>! :)
3	@IATA this @skypickercom not offering refunds for tickets even when the airlines offer refunds. Forcing ppl to pay extra for addons.
5	I have to cancel my reservation and Maria helps my ask.She answered to my question very nicely and kindly.Thanks to her, I can submit my refund form more easily.I'd like to say thanks to her again.
4	good help with changing my passport number, it was fast and easy :)
5	thanks to olga, for getting the answers i needed about luggage weights.
5	Dear Denis,You saved me today :) Thank you so much for your understanding and solving my problems. Everything was so quick and clear, you answered all my questions nicely and patiently. I`m totally satisfied with your help.PS. also Tomas helped me to submit this comment, thank you Tomas for your help :) Thank you Kiwi for working with great peopleHugs from Brazil
4	Olena provided great service over chat as I was making a booking. Keep up the good work <http://Kkiwi.com|Kkiwi.com>!
4	This new #app will find the cheapest international #flight. Learn more about #Skypicker: <https://t.co/yeJO19syBo> #SocialMedia #HolidayTravel
4	Was initially doubtful about this new engine and glad to learn there were more timings provided for my planned trip. Though the return flight was cancelled due to unforseen circumstances but was pleased with the fast alternative arrangement.
1	@skypickercom it was absolutely ridiculous!!!! The fact that  in less than  2 hours we have to do immigration, pick up our luggage (1/2)
5	It was the best service that i had till now
1	it is not a good company which doesn't fit well with your expectations.
5	Pavel F. and Miguel are such stars - they responded to an urgent query immediately and did their utmost to help.  Thank you thank you thank you
5	I received in time the bording-card for the Ryanair-flight CATANIA-ROMA. In the same mail was also the bording-card for the Vueling-flgiht ROMA-WIEN included. However this company issues their bording-Cards free-of-charge at the check-in desk upon electronic reservation.Unfortunately it was realy stressfull to have to pick up the luggages by landing in Rome and re-check them for the flight to Vienna.
4	Very good sevice. Quick respond on mail and phone.
4	It's a bit different than other airfare biking sites because Skypicker does a lot of the backhand work for you, so all you get are etickets and boarding passes directly from Skypicker instead of the airlines. But it worked well!
5	Extremely easy to use, trustworthy and no false advertising
5	I don't speaking English is very very well butIt was very useful to help with the flight refund process.Thanks to Dominica, I could apply for cancellation.
3	Skypicker is a honest service with good prices. My flight was cancelled and they call me to confirm my situation.Sometimes they do the check-in for us. I think that this is not a good policy but overall I recommend the Skypicker Service.
5	I had to add my personal details to my flight last minute and Oliver S. was so extremely helpful in getting it added quickly and also in looking up information for me about the airline. Im new to using skypicker within the last few months and I absolutely love it!! So easy to book, great search functions, and now Im also a fan of the customer service!! you guys are doing a great job!! Thank you!!!!
2	A startup that finds discount flight tickets 'hidden' on airline websites just launched in the US <https://t.co/e1xxDI17aq> via @BIUK_Tech
4	I found the best pricing and best routing to Paris through Skypicker. I never heard about Skypicker before, but it was a positive surprise
3	then it would be important to know how much time you need to connect from one terminal to the other in the same airport or at different aiports.. As I said , Manila airport is one of the worst airports I have ever seen..Calling it a mess does not really give the real informations.
1	"One word about the service at skypicker - unacceptable.  I found skypicker while I was searching for a one way flight for my husband from Greece to New York.  I was attempting to find the best deal and did not realize this meant sacrificing service and knowledge.  While selecting the flight I realized that I needed to pay in order to be able to check my luggage (1 x 20KG) .  I went ahead and paid for the extra which come to find out costs more than the airline itself charges. Okay it was still cheaper than the other flights so I decided to purchase.  After I purchased the ticket I realized that I needed to pay an additional charge for a preordered meal so I sent an email requesting what I needed to do to order and I received a response telling me the options and cost; 39 euros while the airline directly charge 34 euros.  Okay fine, I decided to move forward with purchase so I reached out to customer service on chat at 6:00 EST NY time (which by the way is not a fast response time at all and your left waiting on the person to provide you with some sort of response to show you they are still there).  After she comes back I tell her I wanted to proceed with preordering a meal and asked whats included, she tells me hold on.  Again she puts me on hold for such a long time we eventually get disconnected from the chat and you would think that since they have my phone number of file they would call me back to apologize and proceed with the order - of course not.  I received no call back and no email until midnight New York time (12:40 EST) (while I was sleeping).  When I wake up around 7:00 EST (NY TIME), I find the email with a link telling me to click on the link and pay.  I was still waiting to hear what was included in the Nice and Tasty meal. Anyway I click on the link attach my credit card and pay.  At about 10:24 EST I notice another email that tells me we tried to contact you several times and could not reach you.  Not sure how that was possible since I had my cell phone with me all morning and did not receive not one missed call. The email goes on to tell me "" we regret to inform you that the online option of adding meals to your reservation is no longer available thus we could not add the desirable menu to you flight.""  WHAT?! After all this time of waiting on Skypicker, chatting online, sending emails, paying the service then I get told that I can not order the service.  I immediately attempt to call the US number listed and come to find it they do not provide a country code for the number making it impossible for me to figure out what country I am calling, as you have to add some extra digits when dialing from the US in order to make the phone call.  So I reach out again in chat only to  be told by the agent to hold on for 3 minutes so she researches.  After over 10 minutes waiting, I find out that it was cancelled due to the airlines rules and that we didn't have enough time to order the meal.  UNACCEPTABLE because if the customer service was better equipped with this knowledge when I first contacted them then we would not be in this issue.  I proceeded to tell her that my husband does not have a credit card with him so he will not be able to purchase snacks on board.  She tells me thats okay he can pay cash... WHAT!  Again the agent has no knowledge as to the rules of Norwegian because they do not accept cash and only credit cards for purchases.  My husband flies often and we have never experienced this kind of service ever.  The lack of knowledge that the agents have as to the rules of the carrier and how they instruct you to do one thing when clearly you are unable to do it is just unacceptable.   If they had contacted me back when we first were disconnected I would be able to preorder the meal and we would not have this issue. In any case, our family will never use this service again.  We will also tell all our friends and family the terrible experience we had.  It was such a bad experience.  Saving a few dollars is not worth it - and honestly with all the add ons you are really not saving anything but gaining a lot of headaches and issues.  I do not recommend this website to anyone. Lets see now if they refund us ur money for the meal we paid for that we will not be receiving."
5	I had to change my booking. I gave <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> a call and they called the company and changed it for me. 1 hour later everything was changed. Thank you, Ondra P. and Daria K
5	Lost my e-mail with all references to my booking - Alexandra Y. from Skypicker resolved the problem in 10 minutes  - She did a great job. Customer satisfaction 100%!
5	Extremely satisfied with the service provided, very professional approach and very reliable, thank you guys !
5	I had problems with adding information about my travel documents online I called customer service and Eleonora was very helpful and professional!
4	I was searching for a flight to go to India. There was emergency in the family and wanted flight within 3 days with shortest flying time and affordable price. <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> could meet all these need. Besides I was allocated front comfortable seats in the plane. I highly recommend to use <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com>. Only difference booking through the airlines and <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> is that the flight confirmation took less than a day. They were very helpful in upon contact about the confirmation of all the flights.
5	I received a great and very kind assistant from Tomáš Jurík regarding my request for additional luggage. He was so gentle and helpful and tried his best to help me out! I will definitely use <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> again!
1	"Never book with <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> if your booking is only one inch away from the standard guy profile! We are a Dutch-German couple that wanted to book a flight and we used my German email address and paid with the credit card of the Dutch friend. The name of the credit card holder was amongst the 2 passengers! Despite the security app of her Dutch bank, Kiwi was requesting a supplementary verification through a phone call to their Berlin office. The email requesting this call ended in my spam folder. After 12 hours, the reservation was cancelled even though the payment had been made. Kiwi now tells us that it may take the bank up to 10 days to credit the payment. What an outrage! We did the same procedure again and received a new ""verification mail"" with the request to call Kiwi's Berlin office. We had to find a phone shop in Turkey to place the call. The answering machine didn't work. Result: 3 hours lost, more expensive flight prices, €10 extra phone costs, two credit card payments blocking now for 10 days half of the monthly limit. If Kiwi wants extra confirmation of a credit card, despite the security app of the Dutch bank, they should call the number indicated by us instead of requesting a call to their offices abroad! What kind of service is this?! I can only recommend never to use this site if you do not want to lose time and money!!"
5	I am very happy with the customer support which, especially during the Christmas holidays, the email and chat responses were immediate and very helpful. I solved all my problems within minutes. I was mainly in contact with Jakub Sochan the last week that I needed help with changing my passport details.
5	very good experience
5	The Customer support is great! I had a problem and Jakub P. was very kind helping me out very quickly and professionally! Thank you very much
5	I'm very satisfied  with the customer service I was provided today. Thank you very much it saved me some extra costs and stress on the airport, Thank you, Cezary,
5	Had some issues with boarding passes, got through to an agent called Enri A, who sorted everything out for me straight away and was extremely helpful. Thanks again! good service
5	Marketa was a great help in answering all my questions and sending me the documents i needed to my email in a fast way. Recommend kiwi chat to resolve your issues and questions.Thank you again!
5	Olga helped me make a slight change super quick! Thanks again!
5	Great service, very responsible. Monika was amazing and Jan was really cool as well, they helped me out properly and quick. The only thing I would improve is the chat system that kicked me out while Monika and Jan were working to find the answers to my questions. Thanks
4	i was having a small problem downloading a receipt and Alina helped. She was very very nice and very fast when trying to solve my problem. then i talked with Henry, and he was also very very nice and helpful.they solved my problem, wile being very frendly. great team. :D

5	Natalya P helped me get my boarding passes last minute and was extremely helpful in the process!
5	Skypicker is a great resource tool to find the best prices and options for air travel. They have many options for help and assistance, including a Live Chat online service, which we have found to be very helpful with the staff being friendly, attentive and very efficient. We would recommend Skypicker as a first point option for any traveler.
5	I had some issues with the online check-in but managed to fixing it thanks to Julia's help. She was prompt and fast throughout the hole process.
5	What a great chat-support!! The best help from Stanislav so I could make my first booking with Kiwi.Thanks and best regards Anneli
5	I found with them the lowest price for a ticket from Toulouse to Cologne. I needed to add an oversize bag and one of the reps, Pedro helps me to add the bag and walked me to the process. This save me a lot of money because the airlines for the two trajectories that I was scheduled to make charge a lot more money to add this bag at the airport. Thanks.
5	A3 Plan trips in the country that's where you get to talk to other people and get great tips. I found Skypicker great for flights #ttot
4	Great experience overall, prices are so convenient and it shows you the prices based on the dates you want to book and gives you a price forecast too which I think it's great to know when is cheaper to fly. However, the only drawback is the no refund policy, I mean it's life anything could happen. In my opinion, that's the only thing that hold you back sometimes when making a reservation.Thank you
5	Wasn't sent boarding pass, but was quick reaction and excuses.
5	I found Skypicker to be a very good choice for my flights.  They making booking easy and uncomplicated.  Excellent choice.  Will definitely book with them again.
1	Pesima pagina NO SE ARRIEGUEN compren DIRECTAMENTE EN LA LINEA AEREA, no dan soluciones y mienten con los precios
5	I want to say my thanks to Martin for helping me out in such short time, after a panic attack by not finding my tickets only a few days prior to my departure, I sent an email to kiwi support asking about them. Martin found out I made a minor mistake while typing my email address and sent me the tickets again.Thanks Kiwi for having such a nice user's support, I really appreciate it.Going to spend Christmas with my family finally! Merry Christmas for you all.from Portugal,Simão Santos.
5	Great experience, user-friendly website and the staff are really helpful. Special thanks to Vojtěch N. who helped me with several requests and was very patient and forthcoming throughout our discussion.
5	I appreciate all effort from Youssef that helped me solving the problem, great service and good communication from kiwicom that means you have good staff. i am satisfied with price and service thanks kiwicom
5	I would like to thank so much Eric and Prtr Kuncl for their great help, very efficient and quick. Thanks to them, our niece could catch her flight and could be helped by some nice people instead of keeping on trying to be helped by Iberias Airline People at the Iberia Desk in Barcelona, who were not only useless but very arrogant, mean and who showed no compassion for a 19 year old girl whos flight had been cancelled. (Iberias flight)!!!!!!It almost takes us the pleasure away to travel (especially with Iberia). But thanks to Eric and Prtr this story ended well. Thank you both so much.....
4	Discount airfare site Skypicker offers travelers new ways to find cheap flights <https://t.co/n65yp687Dp>
4	As a first time traveller Sky Picker made it easy to cross the globe. Reservations arrived soon after booking, transit time was decent and when planes were delayed I had no trouble in rebooking.
5	Lucas has been extremely helpful and attentive with my request. While it was nearly impossible to cancel a flight and return the funds in such a tight time frame, he managed to take care of it with ease. Customer service reps like Lucas is the reason I keep using <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com>. Thanks.
5	Hi.. Thanks a lot to you kiwi.. You can bring us fly to our dreamland earlier than we hope.. I very very love you so much.. ��
4	We book a flight to Morocco for our honeymoon and didn't find any flights close to the price we got with Kiwi.   The only challenge was a 22 hour layover on one stop, but it was in Cacun so we booked a hotel and will make the most of it i guess lol.Flights going out only allowed 15 kg for checked luggage, our return was 20 kg.  Took me a few days to get someone via email to help us correctly so i used the online chat and KIRA was very helpful and speedy in meeting our request.  Thank you again KIRA, GOOD JOB :-D
5	I went from Hong Kong to Sydney via Kuala Lumpur with a short layover, due to a delay I couldn't make my connection. AirAsia was super unhelpful and despite both flights being AirAsia, they literally would have rather left me stranded than put me on another flight and actually made me pay a flight change and fare difference fee. I told SkyPicker about it straight away and they were super helpful and told me what to do to get the ball rolling and made me feel better about the situation. I've now just received confirmation that I will be getting a refund from SkyPicker and it's made my day. SkyPicker took responsibility for the situation and they actually cared about their customer, which is getting rarer and rarer nowadays.
5	This was my first booking with Skypicker. The booking process was easy and very user-friendly, but what I appreciated most was additional customer service regarding adding extra luggage to my booking. My contact was quick and really helpful. What is more, there is the Skypicker guarantee, which is something rare in the services among low-cost airlines, however I was happy not to use it as the connections were on time. I was very satisfied with Skypicker and will definitely use it in future.
1	Before, I was willing to recommend Skypicker for the decent prices. But despite the fact that my email claimed they would check in online for me and send my boarding pass via email, this failed to happen - TWICE - forcing me to leave the connecting airport and go through security AGAIN after many tiring hours despite assurances to the contrary.I should point out that the second time it happened AFTER I had been told by a customer service representative that I would receive the second pass.As far as I am concerned, that is lying at worst and incompetence at best. How could you travel with someone you can't trust?
5	Excellent Service Kiwi cough an error in my passport expiration date and Juan Costa did an excellent job buy contact us and ask for the right information. Great Service, grateful, Adali Maldonado
5	I got great costumer service from Vit, now everything is clear for me and i can focus about  having a good time :relaxed: Thank you Vit!
3	@skypickercom Hi there. I am trying to retrieve my @Ryanair confirmation number from you in order to check in online. Could you please send?
2	Won't be using these guys again.  Really difficult to get any real answers to questions.   I.e. Customer support suggested I look at wiki pedia for the visa notice that they asked me to contact them about.   Rubbish.

5	I recently booked the wrong flight to the wrong destination on the wrong day!Ivana V. from <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> was very quick to respond and was immediately dealing with contacting the airline to resolve the problem - many thanks Ivana its was much appreciated.Gary
5	Contacted them by chat, friendly and fast service by Aurelia, my problem was solved within minutes.
5	I was searching information about overweight bags on flights at Philippines. The airline gives only possibility to buy 10kg with 50e (!). Online chat with miss or mr Guljamila A at Skypicker was unbelivably great.  There were no limits how much she or he was ready to help me. Even contacted the Air Philippines by telephone. If I want to buy extra kilos I can simply contact Skypicker and they do it for me.  On the airline desk the price can be 100USD(!). -Also the conversation was very friendly and personal.  Next time I choose Skypicker because this was more than enough they did.
5	I really enjoyed chatting with Lenka. She has been very helpful and put me at ease with the check in process. I was worried that I could not check in since it was my first time dealing with Kiwi. Now I'm ready to fly! Thx Lenka and thx Kiwi!
4	I did have some trouble to make a couple of changes to my flight, the communication was not very clear and therefore it took really long before the changes where made. The customer service employee David P. however helped to set this straight and resolved the issue perfectly. He gave me back my trust in the companies service!
5	My Engish is very poor BUT the i was helped outstanding by Babek who helped me trough the process.Fantastic Job Guys! What a great service!!!!Kind regards,Enrico
2	I just booked my flight with the wonderful help from Bek. I know that all will go well with me. Untill I go and come back, I will reserve my rest comment. Till then, remain blessed
5	A very usefull time with the chat, I missunderstand the expiring date with birth date when setting data into de booking and everything has been resolved by chat whit the skypicker agent.Thanks for your help Helen, You had been so kind !!!+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
1	I tried to change the booking, and it was impossible to do so over the phone. I just got told I should manage the booking online which was not possible because I wanted to change the flight more then just 2 days. In the end I had to buy a new ticket (of course not from Kiwi)....I got no help, I could not contact anyone, but I tried 3 days in a row (calling and via email) but I was left alone. The time before I booked with Kiwi it was not possible to check in via Phone, which is important if you do not have time to print your ticket and go to the check in spot. Kiwi did cost me a lot of money. I am still waiting to get at least parts of the money back (taxes)...I am very disappointed and kiwi did cost me a lot of money.
5	My wife and I booked two one-way tickets from Germany to New Zealand through <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com>.  We were initially sceptical because of bad internet reviews, but we decided to give them a try.  Thankfully the tickets were real and were booked without any problems, and the customer service team handled our request for one extra piece of baggage within a few days.  I would use them again
4	Overall <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> made our trip easy to book.
5	I have give my email address wrongly and did not received my flight booking. ask for help and i'm not kidding. super fast they solve the problem and send to me my booked to the correct email. thank you so much!!

4	After receiving an email explaining how my booking was pending confirmed payment details, I first called and spoke to Alexey.  He was efficient, kind and helped resolve the issue - brilliant!  I then contacted the chat room and spoke to Lucie as I had not received a confirmation email.  Lucie made the experience feel wonderfully personal - she was fabulous!!
5	First Class Service

5	It was my first time using the service of this company. It is user friendly and exclusive service, which can find a great combination of flights. Instructions in e-mails are clear. It is very easy to go through all phases of purchase of tickets. Pleasant is also online check-in service provided by the company.
5	Quick and easy booking with the best price I found anywhere, no issues along the way.
5	For our London vacation we booked via Skypicker and we was very pleased with the service. Our documents came very quickly, our request was answered within a couple of hours and the offered price was great!
5	Kiwi found me the best price and I felt it helped break down some questions I had about amenities.Much later one, I contacted the chat services and Lucie O'Bryan helped my in getting myself an assigned seat. If I had done it another way it may have taken a day or so, but she offered to help me immediately.  I was very grateful, as the good seats were filling up fast.
3	What about our money u will pay back or what come in u r stomach will never goo back . U don't do nothing on our case sheeter . I will never stop to s no u message and tell to every one that's u ar steeler gave back 800 euro u take back or Atlist change the flight it's been six month now u don't do nothing .
3	So I did not write my middle name when I booked my flight as the instruction was not really visible and thus I was charged about 130$ at the transit airport in Taipei by Tigerair Taiwan to change it so that it matched my name on my passport. Since I will be going back and transit at Taipei again, I am afraid that I will be charged again. Aura said that she had told his/her colleagues to contact the airlines. I really hope that this will work out well and I will not have to pay for this unnecessary fee again.
4	I gone replay with the booking no. And everything else  ,My bank start un investigation and i have to see the raport tom . We gone take all legal steps needed .....

5	Michal provided excellent service in an understandable manner.
5	I had some difficulties added a bag to my flight, so I wrote to one of their representatives, Vlad. He helped me in a quick and efficient manner, and answered every question I had.
5	We are very satisfied with the services received from Skypicker and we recommend Skypicker to our friends.
5	James was phenomenal guy. Wasn't able to find the price or time I wanted but James was a very good employee to be helped with.
5	Thank you to Kiwi Customer care that helped me to have my vegetarian meal in my long flight with Iberia!Hana was very helpful and she found a solution to my problem.
5	Sakai helped me was very last-minute problem that I thought was going to be difficult but she made it really easy and she followed up and she did a really great job!! I had called earlier about a different issue and spoke to a Gentlemen whose name I did not get who also did a great job on another matter.Saskia went way out of her way to help me was kind and helpful and did follow through I don't think I've ever had such good service I would always choose Kiwi first after this experience which was also my first one with them!!!!Thank you all so much I will check your service before any other in the future
3	"Overall, using Skypicker was easy to use and served it's fuction well. However, after the terror attacks in Brussels, changing my flight was a nightmare. I never received notification that I wouldn't be able to fly into/out of Brussels this weekend or any useful information about how to change my flights. I ended up buying a replacement ticket for more than half of what I paid previously for 5 flights in total and had to ask to make sure I would be getting a refund from Brussels Airlines. My first flight is tomorrow yet I never received the correct information on my tickets until I had to contact them about it once again. Finally I received my ""E-ticket"" but I still have yet to receive my boarding passes - very stressful.On the other hand...During this process of contacting customer service what seems a million times, I encountered a few very friendly and helpful customer service agents. They always were able to get my questions answered in a timely manner and made sure that I left without any additional questions. One agent in particular, Neil, did an outstanding job. Just as I was about to vow to never use this company again, Neil was very friendly and insisted that he would solve any problems/questions that I have and he was right. I am very thankful I was connected with someone like Neil who got rid of my nerves and stress and made sure I had everything I need to enjoy my upcoming vacation."
5	I have just booked a flight and have been on the phone with one of Kiwi's representatives; Natalia. She was very kind, helpful and to the point. There was also a very short wait to get the call which I appreciate.As far as customer support I am very pleased with Kiwi, I hope my travel proceeds smoothly as well.
4	They seemed to find the best price for where I wanted to go, but really shined in the customer support. When I needed to change my flight dates twice at short notice Sara, Tomas and Monica were able to work fast and efficiently get it done, and for much lower cost than I had initially expected. Many thanks for your help guys.
4	I was very happy with Kristina's services. And she was very quick on the live chat!
5	I've missed my flight by my mistakes and contact to kiwi. And then she tried to help me in many ways and make me feel comfortable. She was absolutely nice and kind. Thanks LENKA!
5	After I booked the round trip tickets between Paris and Italy some days ago,I found out that i forgot to add the check-in luggage. so I tried to chat in the chatting room. Mila in <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> helped me and provided me a good service for me to book and pay for the check-in luggage before i go to airport.As far as I know, paying for the luggage through <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> earlier is much cheaper than paying at the airport.so, the chat and payment link provided by Mila was very helpful.
4	Every think was fine!
4	Unfortunately sky picker do not offer to change the flight without Mastercard or Visa. I paid my Booking with Maestro. But I did accidentally a mistake and choosed a wrong date. So I wanted to change, but it is only possible with credit or visa card. They are also not refundable. (that's why 4 stars)So I had to book a new Flight. With Maestro(link to sofortcom) again. BUTI want to mention that all the customer service people wich I had contact to were very patience with my issues and very kind. I am very impressed. (5 stars)Thank you to Martin Carter Smehlik, Mayyas Hazeemeh and two other customer servers which I do not know the name anymore. Thank youKramer
5	Many thanks to Miquel for fast support and resolving of my problem!
1	Kindly do not use this website. They never informed me that they did not book my flight ticket and just had my money taking for my account for more than a month until I contacted them myself. The superviser call me a child. Terrible business ethics.
5	Person on the phone was very helpful and kind. Mr Peter KOVAL came up with solution right away and was very professional.
4	I recieved great and fast service from Lucie F. on the live chat while having many many questions about our booking and luggage. Now I can only look forward to our trip! Thank you :-)
5	Lucie O'Bryan was very helpful, educated and nice by helping me, I liked her job!
2	@skypickercom deceptive customer service false reassurances frequent delays. #neveragain. Skyscammer on skyscanner
5	Angelika was extremely helpful, sorting my booking with great efficiency and very quickly. Very polite and friendly service. Would recommend <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> to everyone and will certainly use their services again in the future.
5	several weeks ago I discovered in google that such web-site exists <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com>, at first I was skeptical but I took the risk and booked the flight. Then I had some issues with the schedule of my flight and I was worried, but your operator Issic Castro helped me to solve this problem very fast. Thank you very much!!!
5	I made three different reservations with Kiwi at different times, dates, but all for the same trip.  It was rather confusing, as my plans had to change halfway through making my reservations.  There was one double booking (two bookings for the same airline flight) that I don't think I made, but the other issues: change of flight, passport information, etc. was my doing.  Kiwi first called my cell phone about my change of flight request, but I couldn't talk to them at that time, as I was driving. I called back later...the phone number was clearly listed on all email communications...and reached a very helpful person who was able to access all my records and work with me to clear everything up quickly.  I received a confirming email the next day.  This was five star service, in my opinion.  Thanks very much, Kiwi!!
5	Hi there, I just want to say a big THANK YOU  to KIWI team and to admire them for their excellent CS. Lenka from phone support resolve my worries just in 5 seconds and she was extremely nice and polite. All the best and good luck!
5	I talk on live chat with one consultant, name is Dorota, and i was very satisfied. I recomand .
5	I would strongly recommend Kiwi to anyone. My representative Jan was amazing. I was running out of time to add my passport details and could no longer check in online (I thought I had more time than expected.) I started a chat with the customer service, and Jan sorted out my problems in no time! Thanks again!
5	Immediate response and very helpful.thanks Oliver for being so efficient.
5	Great service and communication. Service agent was extremely helpful A++
5	I had an issue with my booking and I contacted customer service. Martin Carter Smehlik responded to my request very quickly and helped me to resolve the issue. Overall my experience with the company was great.
1	I ordered and paid two tickets for a flight in South America on 16 november 2016. Kiwi could not deliver the tickets due to technical problems. I am still waiting to my refund for the time being, although several e-mailes and calls without any response.One star is one star to too much. Never again kiwi.
1	These guys are incompetent idiots. Their computer will fuck up your dates and then they will say its your fault and then keep you waiting right up to the date that you want to fly while they investigate and then its too late. Try to get your money back? Save yourself the stress. They are a bunch of wankers and they dont understand much English. Motto is:- IF YOU WANNA FUCK UP YOUR HOLIDAY BOOK WITH THESE USELESS PRICKS
4	customer service agent was so helpful and entertain my problem with no delay. their instructions also easy to followed and make it easier for me to settle my problem.
5	I was too busy to check my mails and therefore forgot to send in my passport numbers. But Filip was my hero of the day. He was able to manage everything that was needed to get my boarding pass in no time. Thank you so much!!!!!
5	Very fast response from Daria even though I couldn't reply at the end and needed to start a new chat with David. Very helpful and fast reply :)! Can't wait for my flight!
5	As a result of my mother breaking her hip in Spain whilst on holiday in her own , I had to organise my husband to fly out to bring her back. Skypickers found me the cheapest flights but I also needed to arrange wheelchair assistance. Skypickers organised this with the airlines and emailed confirmation in case there was a hiccup at the airports. No hiccups and great flights home. Telephone operators were polite and helpful. A very stressful situation sorted with the help of Skypickers. Thank you.
4	I needed to update passport information and they made it very simple!
1	Bad service, long respons to my complain
5	A great company for the savvy traveller. They have the prices of the majority of budget airlines and they are very fast with getting back to questions. They put together very good flight times and do provide direct flights rather than random long-delay connections to save money. Would highly recommend them to anyone who is sure of their travel dates and destinations. They still have great prices for last-minute travel, but do not offer refunds so be smart and know what you want to be doing !
5	The people I worked with were very help prompt and helpful. I would definitely recommend this company. I hope all services were run by such efficient people! Thank you, Eleonora and Jan!
5	Very friendly and great service. Thanks Lukas and Hana for helping me. More power!
5	When I purchased the ticket from KIWI, I was unfortunately not given the E-ticket number itself.I called their customer service line, to inquire about the ticket number. My call was taken by a representative named ANH TRANVery competent, very professional, and courteous.There was a problem with their systems when I called, so he suggested getting back to me later, once he was able to retrieve the information I requested.Which he did. I was very pleased with this serviceBest regardsSTEPHEN  AVAE

4	Natalya was very helpful to me in dealing with a baggage fee issue. I must say that I still think the baggage fees are too high, but this is not her issue. She answered every question in a timely manner and even verified prices with the airlines themselves. She is great.
5	Stanislav was very helpful, my questions were answered quickly and clearly. Perfect service!
1	"I had a perfect experience with Kiwi in terms of travel, but think that Trustpilot users should be aware of tactics they use to increase the number of good reviews. After returning home from a trip, I received an email from Kiwi asking me to fill out a customer satisfaction survey. I did so and gave (deserved) positive feedback. The Kiwi site then gave me the Trustpilot URL and asked me to provide a review. But out of curiousity, I clicked ""Back"" and replaced my positive feedback with negative feedback on the Kiwi site, then clicked ""continue"" and saw that I was not asked to go to Trustpilot to provide feedback. I repeated the experiment twice. So Kiwi is systematically asking only those people who give positive feedback to visit Trustpilot. This obviously results in a skewed Trustpilot sample, and thefore invalid Trustpilot results. As a survey methodologist and a Trustpilot consumer, I find this pretty reprehensible. This said, my travel experience was seamless."
5	Lenka was really helpful as i was already getting scared if I may be able to board the flight.
5	Jolana was a great help in fixing a typo in one my friends middle name.Excellent service, thanks Jolana.
5	I've been helped a lot with the 24/7 chat guys Kristina and Greg.Their answers were quick and exhaustive.Thumbs up for SkyPicker customer service!
5	After a few problems with paying the flight (due to security restrictions, which I can understand) it all worked very well. I found always people on the other side who wanted to help and searched for the best way to solve the problems. Petra M and Ondrej K helped for instance change the connecting flight so that I can have a vacacion of 5 days in amazing Hawaiiiii! How cool is that. Well thanks Petra for that fast and uncomplicated help and as well that you were happy for me to spend 5 days in the middle of the pacific on one of the most beautiful Islands.
5	I found <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> the cheapest and best way to travel!

5	Very much impressed by the effectiveness of Your service, the operator Beshana was very much helpfull in administering my order. Great job.:blush:
5	I was having all sorts of problems with printing my E ticket for an emergency flight to Cleveland OH  for my daughter. After several tries to get my printer to print what I needed, Eric came up with the solution. He was able to send the documents I needed to my email and I was able to print them off from there. I am not computer savvy and was at my wits end.  Like I said, Eric was the man...  Thank you for what you do.......
5	cheap flight, nice website! Nice service, agent was  helpful to answer question about flight before bookings. Thanks Giorgi..
5	The people is very kind, and they have helpt us. No problems at all.
4	Had a great phone call with Babak. He was really helpful and friendly and open to any changes of my flight.
5	everything went smoothly.  Every airline instantly found my reservation and found that my bags had been prepaid.
4	muy buena atencion por parte de los agentes Juan y Adrian cuando llamamos porque no habiamos recibido las tarjetas de embarque. Muy profesionales. Muchas gracias chicos. Silvia Cuixeres
5	I have contact 2 time the <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> for upgrading my flight details and both times the support was very professional.Special the second time Tamara was really BIG of help, she went step by step in solving my request with great support.Recommending the <http://KIWI.com|KIWI.com> for trip booking.
5	Excellent Service - very quick reply and clear understanding of solve the situation
1	Absolute shittest travel agency in this part of the galaxy. You'd have more proffesionality and integrity with a Nigerian email correspondent called John Smith than with this sorry excuse of a agency. Save your time, money and mental health and book with someone else.
5	I was hesitating to buy a ticket of a flight within the US from a UK website. But he price of the ticket is cheap compare to other sites and I was able to see the flight confirmation via email in a while after payment.Good service and fast ticketing! Definitely recommended!
5	"Hi Team! Thank you to Lenka and Tomas F for excellent, fastidious and quick customer support. My flight from Singapore to Chennai was delayed by 4 hours; hence I was bound to miss my second flight from Chennai. They offered my quick + alternative solution(s) and booked an alternative DIRECT flight from Singapore directly to my end destination via ""Kiwi Guarantee"" without me incurring any hassles. Thank you so much for making the unforeseen circumstances a smooth transition for me. Thank you for the being helpful, patient and setting an example of excellent customer service!"
5	The response of the livechat is so helpful by Ira V. and the booking requirement is easy. and i so appreciate about the Information give by Ira V. Thankyou so Much
5	Having being redirected to Skypicker via <http://Kayak.co.uk|Kayak.co.uk>, I can only say how comforting it is to know that this company offers  not only excellent deals but their on-line chat service was second to none. Everything was done in a timely fashion including online checkin andboarding passes! Well done Skypicker have already booked another flight with you!
5	I had the problem with the price of the baggage. I payed even I didn't need to because airlines which I chose offered free 23 kg. Agent acted quickly and arranged refund when I asked for help.
5	Not only does Kiwi find discount flights easily, they have great customer service. Lucie OBryan got back to me right away about changing a name within days, and now we're all set. Would recommend this company!
5	When I was adding passengers details I forgot to add some information. So I get in touch with the Chat Client and talked with Jakub. He was really helpful, and in minutes I had my problem solved.Really good experience with Kiwi.Would definitely recommend.
5	"I bought ticket from Zagreb to Lisbon with transfer in Barcelona. I was flying with Vueling company. Because the first plain from ZG to BAR was delayed almost 2hours and because I had to wait for my luggage almost 1hour, I didn't get to my plain from BAR to LIS. I went to Vueling so they could change my tickets (I was flying with my husband) but they said that they cann't do that because the time between two flights must be min.4hours and I have two separtley paid tickets (not directed flight). So I called Kiwi and they told me to buy another tickets for Lisbon and they will do the refund in 7-10 working days. Tnx to Estzer, he was with me chating all the time due to proces. I am in Lisbon now and enyoing. Hope when i got back home I will find ""losing money"" on my account :) :)"
2	Hello, I have a reservation with your company. The number is 1241742. I didn't really understood the information you gave me. In this moment I don't know where can I obtain my boarding pass, or wether you need more information from me. I wasn't able to contact you via phone you provide neither in English nor in the Spanish one. Please contact me as soon as possible and explain me if I lack information or whatever I need to do next.
5	Absolutely great, fast and professional! Would recommend to everyone! Thanks!
4	I made the mistake of not writing out the full names that are on my passports when I bought my tickets and Irina went out of her way to contact three different airlines to ensure I'd have no friction during my travel. Great service and that alone was worth going with Skypicker!
5	I missed the 48 hour period for check-in online, but kiwi's agent helped me to fill the data. It was done in a minute via the life chat. Thank you very much.
5	As a selfemployed travelagent I am very impressed by the organization and customer service of skypicker - Highly recommended.
2	I tried repeatedly calling the contact number for sky picker in Australia but couldn't get through, so I resorted to the online chat service, as I was desperate to get information about my flight in a few weeks which is to Malaysia via Indonesia. The reason for my trip was a honeymoon, and I explained I was meeting my husband in Malaysia, he was flying there from lax, and I'm leaving from Melbourne. I wanted to try to change my flight to a direct flight instead of going via Indonesia. I didn't book my flight so I had no idea that it was via Indonesia until today when I printed the tickets. It sent me in to a panic due to the flight cancellations because of the volcanic ash in Indonesia. Not only was the girl unhelpful, but she offered me no advice whatsoever and said it was out of her hands, and to try contacting sky picker just before my flight to see where I stand. Absolutely disgraceful customer service, no help whatsoever, not the least bit of compassion for my situation. I've paid 1,000's of dollars for this trip and I just wanted to safeguard it by avoiding the stop over in Indonesia.
5	Thanks kiwi for help and support ! Special thanks to Jolana!
5	I needed help checking in online so I contacted the customer support chat and David helped me out with no problems at all. So far everything is going smoothly with my experience with this company. They have all been very friendly and helpful.
5	This service has proven to be very reliable and effective. The night before my flight I had forgotten to send it my passport information, but was promptly assisted by Neil through the online webchat service. In 5 minutes, my information had been received and I received the boarding passes for all my flights. Would recommend this to anyone!
5	Excellent service through the online chat. I had a problem because I introduced the wrong expiration date of my ID and in 5 minutes an agent changed it for me. It's name was Tetyana, thanks here to her!
1	"I booked in error, a return flight, for 2, to Faro.  I should have booked for Porto.  Before the flight was confirmed, I rang and spoke with a member of staff, explaining my mistake.  I was told that she would deal with it; and call me back.  The following 2 day's, I spent over an hour, on each occasion, on live chat, requesting the flight be changed.  I was told that they would send me the option of what changes I had, by email, for the following morning (day 3).  I did indeed receive the email, as promised, with 3 options.  I ""live chatted"" back what my option was and followed the instructions I was given; and on each occasion, I had to pay the full price for the option.  I spoke with a member of staff, who told me that this was correct, as stated in their terms and conditions.  Considering that the flights I booked with Skypicker are with Ryanair; and had I booked directly with Ryanair, I could have changed flights for a minimum charge, this was very, very poor service.  Ok, the mistake was mine; but it could have been rectified easily; before the flight was confirmed.  Bad practice.  I certainly won't be using Skypicker again; and will advise anyone to keep away from them."
5	A flight I had was delayed 3 hours causing me to miss a connection with TAPportugal, who refused to help in any way shape or form other than charging me more than twice the money I had originally spent on my flights, so I called up Kiwi and explained what happened and my operator Lucas got my set up with fresh booking at no additional fee the next day. What a guy, he offered to call me back instead of putting me on hold, and did so promptly to tell me the emails with E-tickets had been sent my way. A++ will be using Kiwi for all my travel needs in the future.
1	"What @skypickercom needs is a ""shitty airline filter"" to remove results with Ryanair, Spirit, Frontier, et al. Otherwise fucking genius!"
5	Had to change a passengers passport details due to it being stolen, VeronikaB replied and sorted the details out very quickly with no hassle, great service, would use the company again

5	I had  issue with not receiving myconfirmation/eticket, went to live chat and spoke with Iryna. She was amazing and had everything sorted wthin minutes. Thak you Iryna. Fantastic!!!
1	Booking with sky pikers was nightmare without ending rather pay extra to others than this the call centre is located in the middle of no where operator can not event understand due to lack of English plus hanged the phone on my face
5	Makes booking journeys with connecting flights so much easier. Chat service on website very useful for answering questions. Both representatives that I talked to ( Jan and Elsa) were very polite and helpful.
5	Thank you so much Patricia for helping me with my booking problem!! Excellent attention!!
1	"I tried to talk to a live rep to discuss options and cost to change my flighy to 3 days earlier. I tried to call, they only allow phone calls if you are at the airport. I tried their chat on two different phones using chrome and google browsers. Their chat is not updated to the later version of either and does not display/ work properly. I talked to a rep by saying I was at the airport- I asked what the cost would be to change, the rep said that they couldn't help me because they didn't have access to cost info. In the background I heard a rep saying to a customer ""don't get angry with me"". I ended the call and booked on another airline. Summary: can only change on-line, their chat is unusable with an android phone with latest browsers, their phone reps don't have the capability of providing customer service. These are all (bad) management decisions."
5	Thanks a lot to <http://wiki.com|wiki.com> and valentin, help me get the low price tickets and comfortable service with easy approach to change my <http://trip.It|trip.It> is really helpful.
1	Very disappointed.  My son booked a flight from Montreal to Frankfurt and return for $953 USD on Lufthansa.  He then asked Kiwi to change the itinerary to go to Valencia, Spain a few days earlier.  They took over 12 hours to get back to him by email (the website says within 4 hrs).  They offered him 2 choices, one on a low price carrier with longer layovers and one on Lufthansa. Great!  Except the price for the change was MORE THAN THE ORIGINAL TICKET!!  $1050 USD!!  NO refund or credit for the flight he wasn't using from Montreal to Frankfurt.  Just another full fare ticket from their website listings.  Come on!  You are a discount carrier.  When I researched options on their website I found lots of other choices for less $$, including a seat for $600 on Air France with a reasonable layover, but by then it was too late.  My son had paid for the change feeling a sense of urgency about not finding a ticket to Valencia at all since he had only been offered the 2 options after waiting overnight for a reply email from Kiwi.  He also thought, wrongly, that there would be a refund for the Montreal to Franfurt flight he was no longer using.  But no!  Kiwi manager claimed that this is what Lufthansa was charging them.  Well, if you don't have good relations with the airlines, get out of the discount travel business!  I will never have my kids, nor will I or my husband, or our friends, use this discount site.  And my recommendation to anyone reading this:  Use an American based discount travel website like travelocity, hotwire, kayak expedia, orbitz, or find discounts thru the Airlines that charge a fixed $200 to make a change in a leg of the trip.
5	I had great experience with <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> booking tickets. Easy to find what you need. I booked it and paid it without any problems. When i needed help to manage my booking very nice guy Alan in online help service helped me very quickly to solve my problem. I would recommand this company!
1	I'm So annoyed about their refund policy.I was booked with my friend trip to Thailand(2016/7/3 ~ 2016/7/9).But my project is extended until August 8. So, I requested to Skypicker to refund my ticket, but they rejected. Next, I requested them to change my ticket's name so my friend could use my ticket. They also reject.Is it possible? First, it is ridiculous that they have no policy about refund. Second, if they have no policy about refund, I think they should have plan B at least. This kind of arrogant response is very unpleasant and I think they hardly consider consumer's unexpected situation.If you are not a prophet or God, DO NOT use Skypicker.
5	Hello there,I just had a question about my boardcard. I was chatting with that friendly Supporter called Henry. He was very nice even it's a Sunday night! He helped me out immediately and made my day!Maybe I got lucky or maybe the supporters are always as great as Henry was.Thumbs up!
4	I want to thank Issis for solving a problem which was entirely my fault and for providing assistance and help during my call!
4	Submitted a question and received a response within minutes, very good service.
5	Skypicker has been extremly helpful and serviceminded. Very quick to answer and a good understanding of my needs for help.
5	Thank you Babak for your service and patience, we were very satisfied!
5	I called to make a change in my booking information and the customer service rep was very helpful and friendly - Aamer Tageldin. I would recommend the site to others.
5	Nina helped me to change my expiration date on my passport information before my trip. no problem at all :)
5	Still haven't flew yet, but the service until now has been great and quick. Emre Tam from skypicker was ready quicky and gave me detailed support allthe way. Everything was prepared for me before flight. For now, it's been perfect
4	I could not seem to checki in online and Lukas was very service minded and helped med add the details that were missing and made sure it was sent to my email and not only to head office central booking.
5	Michael answered all my questions patiently, and thoroughly.
5	Typed in my e-mail wrong, opened a live chat, and they fixed it immediately. Very helpful
1	"This is the first time I book with Skypicker, and probably also the last one. I've always booked with E-Dreams, but I chose Skypicker this time because it was cheaper. Big mistake! If you are Spanish, you only can be attended in your language a few hours from Monday to Friday. I had a problem on Saturday, and nobody in Customer service spoke Spanish during weekend: they just told me to call on Monday. We the Spanish customers pay the same, but we can't receive a 24/7 service. Skypicker treat us as ""second class customer"". I'll be back to E-Dreams, maybe they are more expensive, but they can attend in my language, even in weekends."

5	Skypicker is easy to use and it gives you the best deal every time you use it. I recently had an issue with my booking which Anna kindly helped me solve. She was really nice and really helpful. Thank you, Anna!
5	how careless i was that I chose the wrong flight date!! I initially wanted to book the same flight as my bf did.. and i paid so fast that i didnt even notice the date was not the one I wanted. I was very sad working in the afternoon. Late night i talked to the online agent, Alan, and he is sooooo helpful. He helped me cancel my flight and get full refund, and the most important thing is he made everything clear and totally ease my anxiety. I really appreciate kiwi website and this efficient agent, Alan!! I will absolute recommend <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com>!!
5	I've only encountered their customer service so far, via online chat, but that was a great experience. I had a few questions about making sure my partner and I would be seated together for our flights in December, and Alice W. was very patient and answered all of my questions in a very comprehensive way. The conversation didn't feel rushed at all, and Alice was very thorough in her responses.
5	Call answered fast. Got swift, useful assistance from Eric.
5	Great service!!! Special thanks to Neil for the excellent help and service!!!
5	I asked help to manage my reservation Valery was very very kind!!!! Soo clear and resolut!!! Fast and Perfect!!!
5	Ably handled customer support
5	I booked my first skypicker flight ever for the trip my husband and I are taking shortly.  We haven't taken the trip yet so I can't comment on the actual flight, but I can and do want to comment on the fantastic customer service and also the site itself.  Everything on the site is very easy to navigate, it looks very appealing and is so user friendly.  However, I still managed to somehow mess up several things during the booking process, like entering an incorrect birthday, etc.  Upon realizing I have done several of these things, I was able to reach out to a customer service rep immediately by using the very handy chat function, which I find is the best way to talk to a customer service in general.  I've used it at least 3 times at odd times of the day and night, and every time the rep was very helpful and solved my problem immediately. I actually just had to use the feature right now, and the rep I talked to, Martin Carter, was super helpful and really nice and friendly!  He fixed my problem immediately (the problem was completely my fault) and even offered to do an online checkin for me when i hadn't even thought of it  He also gave me a little walk through of the site, which was appreciated. Anyway I just wanted to leave this to say thanks for making the booking process so easy and painless.  The reps are so nice it is really a pleasure to talk to them.  I hope the flight itself is as pleasant as this booking of the flight experience!
5	Good service by Martin Ch. after discovering that we ordered the flight at the wrong date. they changed the date with no extra charge and saved the vacation.
5	Every ticket that I had to book through kiwi provided an extra security for me since they take into account seriously the satisfaction of their customers and I really understood that after a problem with delayed and cancelled flights I had to face because of bad weather. Jaime at first and then Tetiana helped me directly by providing me the steps I had to follow and keeping in contact with me to be sure that everything was rearranged so as to go to my final destination. They also offered directly to cover my lost flight after they confirmed of the delays caused by the weather. Trust them and you will have always your flights secured!
5	Very friendly and competent assistance! Pavel could help me with my request and made my travels a lot easier! Keep up the good work!
5	Really good, friendly and fast service from the hand of Emre T. who answer me at the moment.Nice service Emre T. Keep working like that!
5	Olena was so helpful and polite, she fixed my problem quickly and made me feel very confident in my future dealings with the company.  Thankyou Olena
5	Let me give a bit info on my initial frustration :)I had a booking with Estonian Air from Tallinn to London but unfortunately Estonian Air went bankrupt all of a sudden and my booked flight went bankrupt with it! As funny as that sounds, it wasn't funny for me because i had booked that ticket since Oct. 5 as it would be cheaper to book a flight 1 month ahead, rather than just 1 week before departure. I practically had to start surfing websites for flights for 17th Nov. and maybe same time if possible. Since it's now like a weeks time to departure, flights would be more expensive.I went unto <http://momondo.com|momondo.com> and a flight itinerary that landed me on <http://skypicker.com|skypicker.com>. Judging by booking a ticket 1 week to departure, the price i found on skypicker was fairly cheaper, like 30 GBP cheaper than all the sites i have checked.On making the reservation, i got a reservation number which honestly didn't look familiar to me as a reservation number. I got a confirmation page showing my reservation number, but my name was not on the page like it would show on other sites. This got me more worried and i thought i had been swindled.I saw the chat popup at the bottom left corner and buzzed a 'Hi' with a straight face on me. Alexandra Lyaptseva responded immediately like she was waiting for me to buzz. I had thought i was going to wait for like eternity before someone would have mercy and respond, but Alex responded promptly. I was still wearing my straight face though! Alexandra was patient with me and i could even feel her calmness in her text, even if she didn't look it on the other end, well i cared less, 'cos she was simply patient and respectful. She put all my dowsed all my doubt and answered all my questions. She was kind i'd say. She even offered to enter my document details and check me in online by herself. At this point i felt safe to give my details as she had been incredible attending to my questions and concerns!I was preparing an academic presentation which i had to finish like in an hours time, but i just could not but push that aside and show how grateful i am to Alexandra Lyaptseva. Thank you once again Alex, you are a darling and you deserve a MEDAL. Your sup should do something. Your help may seem little, but the meaning of little may differ with different perspective. Thank you SkyPicker - keep picking the skies :D and thank you Alexandra Lyaptseva for being there when i needed help. God bless you!
3	This New App Will Find You the Cheapest International Flight <https://t.co/zXoQ21Bu0x> via @CNTraveler
5	All the time I used other travel agent, but suddenly I discovered Skypicker, which offered tickets with 25-30% lower price. So I booked journey with total 7 flights, and everything was fine. I enjoyed the trip.
5	"I had an instant message conversation with Phana who was very courteous and helpful with information. She spoke to me about that when purchasing online, the cost you pay for carry-on luggage is the full price for all of the airline companies. So if it say ""$100"" to bring a carry-on, that is the only price you'll pay for that entire trip, regardless of how many airline companies you take to get you to your final destination.I also spoke to her regarding allocation of seats and that you can choose seats after you book your tickets. After booking the tickets, then you can go through the individual airline companies making up your trip and pay a fee to allocate your seat to where you want to sit. This price can range from airline to airline, which stinks a little in that you don't know how much you'll be paying for the seats you want until after you've committed to buying tickets.All in all though, it was a very good conversation, and she gave me a lot more information to make an informed decision. Whether I go with Skypicker or not, I can at least know that Phana was someone that was good to speak to and a good representative for her company."
2	Not good company bad services and rights of non-reserved
5	I found skypicker as one of the easiest and most userfriendly recent online flights booking websites. It gives a cool tone to your route search and I got an effective help/solution to one mistake I MADE in a reasonable short time. I recommend it to any traveler who likes booking on line with minimun frictions.
5	I've just booked my flight with @SkyPickerCOM. Find some great deals too at <https://t.co/LwVlloOPrn>
5	I bought a one way ticket, almost two months before the flight date with a little airline. I was sceptic because there was no way to verify that the seat was booked with <http://TUIfly.be|TUIfly.be> and the checkin was 48h in advance... So i trust them... 48 hours before my flight i log on the chat, wonderful Zuzana S. and Viktoria S. check me in within 5 min and everything is swell. 10/10, i now downloaded the app and use it on a regular basis (didn't buy anything yet though). cheers!
4	I had some troubles with my booking and couldn't find where I should fill in passport details. I have used their help chat, waited couple of minutes and then I was connected with Kiwi helpdesk member (name Vladimir). I think most of us doesn't have very good experience with help desks but this one was amazing!. Very helpful - actually he did everything instead of me and in the end he sent me boarding pass to my email. Really nice!
5	A big thank you to Bogdan at <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> who helped me with my plane tickets and cleaned up all the mess I made for myself! You really are an angel!
1	Because of the way the calendar on their website is designed, it changed my input from May 14 to April 9. I contacted within the hour regarding the issue. I was still charged and was told I can change my flight. When I asked to change it, I was told I would need to pay the same amount plus a fee.... so more than what it would cost through Kayak. They didn't even offer credit. I've bought from here before and had the same issue with the layout but caught it before confirming my info. This is absolutely frustrating. I am so disappointed.
1	BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE WITH BUNCH OF LIARS MAKE SURE YOU CHECK YOUR BAGGAGE INFO BEFORE YOU BUY A TICKET
5	I would like to thank Svetlana & the team at Skypicker for their fast and great help when I was stranded in Malaysia due to Ethiopian Airlines. They investigated what happened, presented alternatives and rebooked my connecting flights which I really appreciate! While the airline was an absolute disaster skypicker really made a difference! 5+ stars!
5	Skypicker provides kind and human services to their customers. I was forced to miss my flight due to the health conditions but the skypicker's stuff tried its best to refund part of paid money despite the fact that I had not concluded the contract concerning cancelation of the flight insurance.
5	To: Josef Elias     Travel ConsultantThank you so much for your service. We are indeed grateful that things went really well regarding the concern that we addressed to you. You have a been great help. Great Job! Have a nice day! Bless you.Regards,Jaferson Paurom

1	cancelled my booking, saying it was a technical issue when really they did not want to give me the price offered. Using there online chat service was like speaking to a robot that literally knew nothing about anything.Now I have to wait a matter of days to get my money back before I can book another flight, preferably with someone else!!
2	A startup that finds discount flight tickets 'hidden' on airline websites just launched in the US <https://t.co/N7vKmDy4U6>
1	Changing my review to 1 star. I was so happy on how they accommodate their customers when they're just making their booking but when something horrible happens, as for me I wasn't able to board the plane they wouldn't offer any services as they're unable to help. My flight was today and arrive at the airport 2 hours before the time on e-ticket. To my surprise the attendants or people from the airlines woudn't let me to board the plane without a returning ticket. I'm already going back and forth to Japan multiple times only with a one way ticket and this is the first time I was questioned like that and it happens that I have also a problem with my card that's why I wasn't able to book a return flight at that point. Also one person there stated that it's okay to rebook the flight which he didn't state to me that I need to rebook it before the time of the departure of the plane. So I decided to call you guys to see if you can help me on this case and my nephew calls multiple times which you guys stated that you can't do anything about it and the only option you provided to me is to purchase a whole new ticket which I think is ridiculous. This is my very first transaction wtih you guys and also had this kind of scenario, it's very unaccetable experience from you guys and also the airlines. My nephew also decided to stop using this site as he find it ridiculous to continue dealing with you guys with statement like those.
1	About a month ago my girlfriend and I booked our flight home with Kiwi. We were flying home to Toronto from Athens. We booked to leave on October 25 with a twelve hour layover in London on the 26. When we arrived at the airport we weren't allowed on the plane because they booked our flight for the 24th, a day early. After much stress they got back to us around 10 pm that we had to get on a flight to Istanbul for 10:30 pm. I paid for a flight to Istanbul then from there to London to catch our original flight. I was told I would be reimbursed but I haven't seen the payment since. It is now December 5, over a month and they still owe me well over $1000.
5	The most convenient flight booking site I have ever used. Suitable to both: frequent and new flyers.You simply choose the flight, make a payment, add personal details and that is it. No need to worry about when to do the online check-in as Skypicker sends the tickets automatically onto client's email address.I would recommend the company to anyone who flies frequently.
5	Great customer service! I was too late with everything regarding to my flight to Jerez and Sergei from <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> helped me to sort things out, even when the fault was totally on my side. Thank you so much!
1	to cheap to function
5	Aura Thanks for helping me to correct the name on the ticket. you did a great job and fast !!!
5	It's simply to find your properly flights and register Booking. I like their elegant dealing when giving the service.My special regards to staff ( Natalya ) for her high interested to solve my dilemma in last booking , through chat + E-mail and call. Thanks for all
5	Honestly I do thorough checks for the cheapest deals and sky picker is always the cheapest. Customer service was helpful too .
5	One of the most amazing flight services ever! I booked a flight from Paris to Berlin and made a mistake, called their customer service that picked up the phone without any wait. Took my request and completed it within 24 hours and didn't charge me any extra amount. Would highly recommend Kiwi. com #kiwi #bestcustomerservice
3	I am quite upset with the flight company.  More than 4 hours delay and nothing is organised for the passengers left in the middle of the night in a closed airport,  with no place to eat or sleep. ..
5	My first flight was canceled and kiwi found an alternative flight for me. The only frustrating part was waiting until kiwi confirms cancelation, but I understand it was necessary.
5	Today Anastassia settled me, worried I wouldn't be sat with my children and with major anxiety around flying she not only reassured me but sent me a detailed plan of where i will be sat on both journeys. What a girl!!! It's difficult dealing with anxiety and travelling without showing your children and the work Anastassia has done to keep me calm in front of them has been infallible thank you I now look forward to my family holiday xxx
5	Thx really helpful and fast and really nice !!!
2	Your customer service team was extreamly nice and understanding but your confirmation processes as a company seemS to be more than lacking. Taking 4 hours to confirm a flights availability is out dated. After I stated that I needed confirnation now your team was nice enough to accelerate the process and they got back to me within 20 minutes. To some up Customer Service= 5 stars company experience 1 star and the fact that my refund takes seven days is ridiculous.... I should have been able to get a refund from the moment you realized you can´t confirm a flight.Good luck!
5	Elsa C helped me to book my order. she was so kind. thank you for everything!
4	Dear Nat, I  appreciate your readiness to help, keep it up, thanks. Further comments will be after my trip because I am yet to make my trip. Cheers!!
4	Thank you for your support. Are to be congratulated for the excellent work.Well done!

4	Thank you, Eugene, for the great customer service and flexibel helf and information! Great service!
5	Martin Carter was of great help! great service! thank you!
4	At first I thought I clicked on BBC Radio instead of the local Czech, but not, just a perfect English #advert for a job in @skypickercom.
5	Yuriy Vyshtal was very helpful, in 2 minutes my problem was sorted. very nice service!!
5	Tried to cancel the booking due to sickness but then felt better over night and Michael Stasek helped revoke the cancellation request. Super helpful!
1	"I booked a flight last night (Tuesday)for my sister and I to fly out this Friday to say goodbye to our brother who was given less than a week to live.  His oncologist told him this just yesterday (Tuesday).  He is in end stage terminal colon cancer and has just gone down hill really fast this past week so we didn't have much warning at all. So I booked 2 tickets for  $631 through kiwi on frontier airlines. I got an email stating my flight booking was ""processing""so I got my kids to bed and I went to bed. I wrongly assumed all was well.   My sister booked 4 nights at a hotel near my brother which is non refundable.  Then in the morning I noticed an email stating I needed to call kiwi to confirm my payment info within 12 hours of booking.  It was well within 12 hours and the customer service rep assured me that everything was fine and would process the order again so I went to work and didn't worry about it.  Then when I got a couple minutes break around 11:00 am, I checked my phone and saw an email saying the flight went up in price by an additional $271. I called, was put on hold for a long time, then the customer service rep said they didn't ever get my flight booked before the price increased. I asked for a manager,  she said they would look into it and call me back.  I called my sister to have her call kiwi since I had to get back to work. She called several times throughout the day,  only to get the same run around and they would call her back 30 min later etc and putting her on hold for huge stretches of time only to keep seeing prices increase and they kept saying there was no way they could give us our original flight for the same price we had booked it for the night before.  After I got home from work I called again,  this time finally reaching a manager but he said he couldn't give us our flight for the original price either even though it was not our fault they didn't ever actually finish processing my payment. Kiwi never offered to pay the difference in price or to refund us the difference.  They only offered to send us on another flight that had a 12 hour over night lay over in Denver for an additional $100. What a freaking joke!  Like that would help us in any way at all? We would have to pay for a hotel room which would just bring cost up an additional 100$ not to mention the huge inconvenience it would be to have that long of a layover.  So we said no thanks to their generous offer to sleep overnight at the airport and we had to book directly with frontier and by then the flight had gone up an additional $180. Grrr!!! Also,  I checked with my bank to see if the credit card ran through or if there was some problem on my end and the card was totally fine,  not expired, $2500 limit and it was showing a pending charge for $631 had run through on 1/31/17 which was Tuesday night, the night I had originally booked. So it had gone through my bank right when I booked it.   I am beyond frustrated and I am sick about this! It is unbelievable that kiwi can get away with this fraud and stay in business!  RUN AWAY AND NEVER USE KIWI!  THEY ARE JUST A SCAM TO HOLD YOUR PAYMENT UNTIL THE PRICE GOES UP TO TRY TO CHARGE YOU MORE MONEY! !"
5	Chatted now with Irina from Yekaterinburg, because I had some questions about my lagguage. It was a very helpful conversation and she could answer all my questions. I am completely satisfied.
5	Great online service spoke to Natalya P and she was very helpful and efficient! Thanks Natalya :)
5	I had very good help to check in extra bagage.
5	The staff helped me perfectly with all my questions, quick and friendly!
5	The process was smooth from start to finish ! I plan to use kiwi in the future and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend them . Less than an hour after ordering flight tickets I was emailed my conf. shortly after I was able to verify my booking directly with the airline website, checking in at the airport and everything there after was a piece of cake
5	I received help whenever I had a question. Thanks
1	This company's automated security has blocked my payments twice now, each time while I was already at the airport. There is nothing wrong with my card, I've verified my identity, yet they still make me wait two to three hours only to find out that they didn't book my flight and made me find a hotel for the night and an even more expensive flight the next day. Why they don't update these systems is anyone's guess, but they've lost this customer.Never book through this company unless you like gambling on whether or not you'll get your last minute flight.
4	Flexibility in finding the flights.I like that after booking I receive also the boarding passes.
2	Very useful!!
5	I was sooo confused about my documents.but Thanks to Kojo for helping me and assisting me..Keep doing this great job guys :) :)
5	I use their services almost weekly, I have booked so far ca. 16 flights. Very good customer service - I often use live chat to manage things like amending booking etc.
5	Excellent service! I really want to thank Alaa, an assistant who helped us really fast and well! Such a professional job :)
5	Best travel agent I've ever had, and I do travel a lot. Thank you so much for your kind quick, and efficient help.
5	@askairasia kindly see the pictures below..that send by <https://t.co/mikv0EGp1z> <https://t.co/hVnXlUUOW2>
5	Found the cheapest price for flights here and the online chat is helpful if any problems arise. Thanks to Kojo for helping me resolve my issue with my flight from Porto to Brussels!
5	Very good service!I changed my passport after purchasing tickets. I contact to Support and my problem was solved at the same day! Staff was very polite, added correct information about my document.thank you very much!
5	I booked flight from Oakland to Las Vegas but booked wrong timings. Spoke to Simon who sorted it all out without any hassle. He spoke to spirit airlines to change the times and also called me up confirming these changes. Excellent and very prompt service from Simon. Thanks.
4	In the past it was goodNow I would not advise dealing with this companyBetter direct booking of airline
5	The representative (Hana) was very thorough and helpful in a cancellation crisis! Personable, reassuring, and attentive. I look forward to using the company in the future.
5	great service!
5	Never used Skypicker until now, but it offered me the best flight to the best price so there was nothing to argue about. Easiest booking ever AND they even checked-in online for you, e-mailing your boarding cards ready to print! From now on I'll pick Skypicker whenever I can!
5	Airline changed my flight from 2 hours direct into 7 hours with one stopover. Kiwi called me immediately, but I was unreachable so I was contacted via email. Fortunately there was another flight with different airline at almost same time. So I asked for cancelation of the first one and booked the another one. Of course again on Kiwi :-)It took few emails but at the end my journey is saved. Thanks to Tomáš Formánek and others who participated.
4	"Definitely satisfied so far with your ""live chat"" service- Mr Dániel Péter played a vital role to my impression since his service was exactly what I needed from a service like this.."
5	I booked a flight but I found a better offer (still on <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>) few minutes later. I asked for a refund and I chatted online with Tomas L. He was really kind, polite, efficient and quick to respond to my request. My experience with him was unique and I felt as if I was a priority; I will definitely book again with your compagny. I sure will recommend <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> to anyone.Best regards,T.
5	Awesome and very helpfull stuff. Daria helped us in really kindfull way and extremelly fast! It's all what you need before your flight. We are flighting only with Skypickers help! Thank you.
5	I choiced Skypicker to manage my trip to Peru and everything went well. From Italy to Peru and internal flights were great. Thanks Skypicker
5	Very satisfied with your customer service guys. Agent Sena is absolutely clever with her work and she made the whole thing easier for me :) Thanks again Sena!
5	My experience with skypicker was great. The customer service is awesome! Whenever I had an issue, I simply used the chat and someone responded within a few seconds. The representative Jonathan was also a wonder to work with. He went as far as calling me when the chat was disconnected to help me the resolve the issue. This is my first time working with skypicker and I will definitely be coming back in the future when I would like to travel again.  Great work skypicker!
4	"so far i say the customer service thru chat portal was very good ""RENATA"" who handled my concerned is very helpful in all way and digging to find the terminal should i go. For now i give you a 4 star and be back and make a review after and or during my flight thnks"
5	Me and my wife were taking a multi country trip through Southeast Asia for our honeymoon and one of the legs that we were on to Sydney was delayed causing us to miss our flight from Bali to Sydney. After getting no help from the airline counter I called Kiwi to see if they could help in anyway. I was pleasantly surprised when our customer service representative Eric said he would have us taken care of. He got us on the next flight out to Sydney and back on track with our honeymoon itinerary. It was something I did not think would be possible without shelling out another grand per ticket. I will always book through <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> when I have a chance!
5	I spoke with the agent Zuzana, who clarified the situation, found the solution and made me feel rested regarding my flight.Thank you very much for the amazing service!
4	I found SkyPicker easy to use, and the service found me a flight routing I would not have found elsewhere.  While other colleagues took longer flights I was able to jump on board the short leg of a Qatar Airlines flight which was a treat.  The outbound connection to budget airline VietJet however was delayed as that airline had arbitrarily changed schedules - which is more the fault of the budget airline than SkyPicker.  Have added Skyjacker to my list of flight booking agencies to try.  Thanks.
5	Hello, I just spoke to your consultant, Mrs Julia K. She helped me with my problem of nonexisting boarding pass. It turned out that there was no passport number, and no possibility for me to do it myself. She said I would wait for 2h, but it was 10 min.I would like to say thank you both to Mrs Julia and the crew that makes boarding passes.
1	I bought tickets from Kiwi, then 12 hours later they told me they couldnt find the flight but had already charged my card. they said they could refund it, and i would get the money back in 10 business days, but 10 days was too late for me. I asked them to look for alternative dates. I was open to traveling any day in two weeks, from any airport in Spain. They said they found nothing. So I sent them a bunch of options on a bunch of different days and wasn`t freaking out yet since there were so many options. - from their website. Then they told me NONE of these options would work because they were all with Delta and there system was having a problem with Delta. the other flights without Delta were 150 plus euros more. If I had known that, I would have just booked with edreams from the start. Customer service was ok but for another 14 hours I had to contact support to see how they were doing with my alternative flights. They never contacted me everytime I had to contact them. the two flights they had offered me where way more than what I ended up paying,what I ended up paying was on a flight that I found, not them. Fnally after so long trying to work out it Jiri helped me out a lot but I ended up just paying more.Also, this is a system error on their end, they should have paid the difference, not me.Those flights were falsy advertised. I bought, then had to upgrade if I didn´t want to go through the hassle of returning my money. Will never book with them again and while I heard some good stories, a few travel buddies told me similar haunting ones. In the end, I felt obligated to buy with them to avoid 10 business days of waiting for my money or  big paypal fees. They never really looked for the best option for me and in the end it was a huge hassle trying to find a flight that would work with them. They should have paid for the difference because they never had those delta flights at that price.  If they had just put a hold on my credit card and not charged me this all would have been simple.
5	Got my boarding cards in two minutes. Before that I had tried to get help from Ryan Air. they hang up on me. But  Serhiy helped me. Thanks.
5	He was the most amazing representative.  He dealt with me and I was the worst person he probably could've talked too. He called me and resolved my situation. He took the time to find a new flight for my husband that is away taking care of his dying sister. He needed more time and Valentin gave it to him. He is an angel from above. I can't express how much it means or every thank him enough and kiwi xoxo
1	On 19/08/2015 I booked from Skypicker a flight from Larnaca to Florence. It was a transfer flight (Larnaca-Sofia with Bulgarian air, Sofia-Bari with Wizzair and Bari-Florence with Vueling) and my flight was going to start on 22/10 at 22:35. On the 21/10 skypicker sent me an email that was saying that I needed to check in at the airport by using the eTicket. So, the next day I went to the airport 2 hours before my flight (as Skypicker told me) and there I was looking for my flight but I couldn’t find it. The Info point of Larnaca airport informed me that my booked flight from Larnaca to Sofia doesn’t exist. I asked them if it was cancelled or delayed and they told me, that they don’t have that flight. They started giving me names of companies and phones to call but to no avail. Bulgaria Air told me on the phone that my flight was changed a long time ago. Skypicker apologized and they said that they will try to find me a solution although it is not their fault because Bulgaria Air never informed them. I asked them to tell me what my options are and what I can claim or ask from this situations and the only option they gave me was either to get my money back or to find me another flight. During the night I asked them another 2 times but they never told me that I can ask for accommodation, food, drink etc. Only the next day they told me that if I had any receipts for fuels, food, or accommodation I can send it to them but of course, it was too late. During the night after many hours of search from my side and skypicker team they found me another flight from Larnaca to Florence through Vienna and Frankfurt for the 23/10. I told them that I need them to cover me the accommodation in Vienna because I was arriving at Vienna airport 19:10 and my next flight was the next day on 24/10 at 06:10. They told me that they will do so only if it is less than 50euro so I started searching for accommodation. They also told me that to add luggage on my flight I have to pay for it at the airport. After a lot of research I found one hotel and booked it. Skypicker team called me and told me that my flights are confirmed and they will send me my tickets via email but never mentioned that they booked me different flights of what we had agreed on, on the phone.  When they sent me the tickets I was so tired, stressed, without sleeping, so I didn’t check the time of flights as we had already agreed on which flights I was going to be given and instead I trusted the company. My first flight (Larnaca to Vienna) was the same as agreed. Good to mention that Skypicker make another one mistake and on email they sent me tickets with wrong name of destination.  I arrived in Vienna, I went to my hotel and there I checked that my flight from Vienna to Frankfurt had already left half an hour before. Once again I started calling, emailing, and searching in websites with no results. Skypicker told me that it was my fault and they can’t do anything about it. I was left stranded in Vienna. So again I spent all night looking for other flights without knowing where my luggage was and spending the last money I had to buy the lowest flight that I could find from Vienna to bologna. I found one through Istanbul with more than 14hours waiting at the airport of Istanbul (SAW) with no money for food and drink, no clothes, no wifi or accommodation. After 4 days and less that 7hours of sleep in total in 3 days, I arrived to my destination losing my holidays, my accommodations I booked, part of my job training,my money, my time, my health, my meetings. I am expecting an apology and an answer for this unprofessional behaviour. I also expecting from you to cover my discomfort and tribulation I have been through.
5	<http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> has to be if not the best flight agency online. I came across them browsing the internet. They had a eye catching website which I couldn't scroll away from, I did everything online which was very easy to use, had no trouble at all with the process quick and easy so it was. They also checked in for me aswell which was fantastic. I would definitely recommend this travel agency to anyone, and I would definitely book my flights again with this company.
5	Fast and trustable work for us
5	Good and fast customer service. I managed to intagrate SKypicker on my web site with the help of Yuriy Vyshtal. Kind and pleasant customer service.
5	Excellent customer service - I needed to change the date of the flight and Anna Trush, one of the agent made the process really smooth and easy.  She made sure to follow up with the flight schedule change status and confirmed it by contacting me and via email as well.  It is usually not easy to reach out to the customer service with the travel agency but with <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>, it was an awesome experience!  I will definitely continue to use this company for my future travel.
5	Could have been a nightmare when my first flight was delayed, but Kiwi guarantee and the travel consultant (Mario R) were very helpful getting me an updated itinerary and my travels back on track.  Mario was very professional and understanding of my personal situation and got me a new flight and made sure that I didnt have to pay any additional baggage charges.
5	I had booked flights through <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> which I had been unable to do myself due to short connection times. I then had to add on luggage for just 1 leg of the journey. I spoke with Martin Ch. on live chat and within a short space of time he had found pricing and emailed a link so I could pay with minimal effort. I can now relax knowing that everything has been organised. Thanks!
4	very sorry that it was impossible to change the ticket ... But the operator Kira was very nice
5	I've got a great attention from the staff. They were really helpful to complete my trip. Ive got some problems, cause I made a mistake typing my date of birth on my reservation, but they helped me to solve it. I had to pay for new tickets directly with the airline. Even when I had to pay for my big and expensive mistake, they were helpful.
5	It is extremely easy to follow the instructions.
4	Filip did his work great, quick and understanding answers. Thank you so much!
5	Wonderful service, helpful people, lowest prices and more. Just excellent! Many luck!
5	Wow! I've never had service like this on a discount booking! My flight was delayed and ultimately cancelled due to weather, and Kiwi simply booked me on an alternate flight with another airline AT NO COST TO ME! Pluse their customer service agents were super patient and polite.This is the sort of service you expect when paying more than full price for your ticket, not on a competitively priced fare like I received! I don't get it, but please keep it up Kiwi!
5	Excellent quality services. Low price , comfort , good service . High reliability . I recommend.
5	Alice W was very helpful and managed to sort out the mix up :)Thank you
5	Eric was extremely helpful and friendly.  Answered all my questions and fixed the problem with my e-mail - Very efficient.
2	A startup that finds discount flight tickets 'hidden' on airline websites just launched in the US <https://t.co/gvZqW13US2>
5	Sara was the best helpful Customer service I've found in my life, and I've traveled a lot. I didn't enter my ID details on time and I spoke to her via In chat and it was perfectly and quickly fixed. She even sent me the boarding tickets when we hadn't even talked about it yet. Thanks a lot for the service, I will recommend you for sure.Kind regards,Javier Zuloaga.
5	Veronika B the customer service travel consultant answered my question quickly and was very helpful. I've yet to sort out my problem with another department. It's in progress...
5	Skypicker is the most versatile flight comparison site. It made all the information required available at point of inquiry, and the booking process was a dream. They even checked in for me.
1	"Worst experience. Arrived at airport checked emails to find I'd been cancelled off my flight because of ""lack of seats"". Asked airline, told me there were at least 20 seats still avail but I couldn't purchase a ticket as the ticket desk had since closed. Kiwi took my money before even securing the flight and won't refund until 24hr to 10 days depending on refund method. Left me stranded in Bucharest airport with no money and no way to get to my tour in Spain the next day. Parents on holiday so couldn't contact them. Eventually was able to get through to my brother in Australia at 4:30am and wake him, his wife and his baby so they could lend me their credit. New flight ended up being nearly £100 dearer.That wasn't even the end of itAm still waiting on my refund via PayPal which was mean to take 24 hours, money that I'm depending on for the rest of my trip."
1	Attempted to purchase tickets & when the system failed getting my own personal nightmare. Poor service, delays in getting back to me. Plus, purchasing tickets flagged two credit cards for suspicious activity. Clearly credit card companies now how suspect this company is.
5	Skypicker is by far one of the most exciting start-ups in the Travel industry today. This is my very first experience with them and it is nothing but the best so far. Right from their user-friendly and very interactive website which has a very rich User Interface, their pricing, flight deals, to their excellent customer service, everything has a top quality written all over it. Their customer service is second to none when it comes to the websites which offer flight tickets in the industry. Their two Travel Consultants - Selorm Frimpong and Tomas Krivanek - were very helpful and provided me a very personal experience. If these guys keep up the good work and keep on innovating, I am sure they will change the Travel industry as we know it.
5	I'm a frequent traveler but was the first time using the Skypicker site and was a very positive experience.The information about the trip was clear and helpful and the check in was automatically made when possible.Definitely an app to keep at hand.
5	Needed to change passport details - couldn't have received better service.
5	Was having some trouble with my flight and Tomas quickly helped me solve my problem. Highly recommend Kiwi for your next flight.
5	When booking the flight via Skypicker I was very suspicious. I, however, had to change my mind very quickly. Skypicker is a very reliable company with a high service orientation and good prices. I booked a flight from Arecife - Madrid (Ryanair) and from Madrid - Düsseldorf (Iberia). I received the tickets for my flight to Madrid in time. The airline overbooked the flight from Madrid - Düsseldorf and I had to stay at the airport. I called Skypicker, they tried to help me and did not let me down. Thanks for everything! I can highly recommend booking a flight via Skypicker - I would do it again...
5	Booking the flight with <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> was very easy, fast. They offer great prices. When I needed to contact costumer service, it was very easy by chat. Stanislav was very helpful,  solved my issue in very short time.
5	Just on the live chat to staff named Yurii N. Pretty fast at responding to enquires about adding baggage to a flight. Very friendly and helpful with the enquires for someone who is on their first flight to Seoul. Going through the live chat option saved time and headaches compared to calling a hotline and trying to figure out which number to call and waiting for someone to answer.
5	Excellent customer service. fast, and reliable. I would be happy to recommend skypicker to anybody
5	I contacted Kiwi through the live chat function and got excellent service from a very nice man by the name Adam Jelinik. He really helped me and came up with solutions i hadn't thought of. Thank you Kiwi and thank you Adam, made my day!
2	first thanks to mr. Radim to help me with my issue, and im sad with ms. Micheala cause she promise to contact me within 3 hours but it already passed more than 12 hours and no respond ,, anyway just for all make sure the international flight has a check in luggage and real transit between flight cause my problem was no checkin luggage and during transit i have to enter the country to take my luggage and make check in again with the next flight,, hope these things can be fixed and arrange by the site admin ,, thanks a lot
4	MANY THANKS FOR YOUR CONCERN ABOUT MY INCIDENCE  AND PROFESSIONALITY IN ITS RESOLUTION
5	Easy, quick, friendly application, great price - for me:)
5	@Skyscanner thanks for the reply!! I had messed up i bought with skypicker this time!! But thanks you guys have a great service always!
4	I had a 3 legs flight the first of which was cancelled due to weather conditions. This caused me to miss all other connection flights as well but Kiwi's customer service is really friendly and I could reschedule my flight very easily. Lukas P. was very kind and helped me a lot. It was a very smooth procedure, I would recommend to others.
5	I had to change my flight and Jakub P went out of his way to change my flights and worked really hard to make the changes and easy as possible. It was just so great to get such amazing service. I dont often leave any reviews but this person was just so great and polite and professional.
5	I had some unanswered questions so I talked to Aliz in the life chat and  she answered them all with a lot of patience and seemed to really want me to be happy. She even listed the whole menu of an airline so that I could choose a meal. I was really suprised how passionated Aliz was in  her job. It was really helpful and I would do it always again if I have any question
5	I am retired person and  a bit slower in understanding all procedures and I would like to thank for excellent help, prompt answers to all my questions  and especially for patience with me . This company has  a great team, very professional. Thank you again and wish you the best! Sincerely, Marie
5	Pavel Fridrich helped me get extra baggage weight allowance with AirAsia. I tried to figure out how to do this on my own but got very confused and didnt want to spend potentially hours with their customer service to figure it out (because AirAsia charges an arm and a leg if your baggage is 1kg over the you alloted limit when  checking in at the airport). I emailed Skypicker and Pavel was assigned to my case. He got me the extra 5kg allowance from AirAsia within hours and i was able to pay the fee through the Skypicker website. So easy. So glad I didn't have to deal with the airline myself. This was my first time purchasing tickets through Skypicker and since I'd never heard of them before I initially set low expectations. But I have to say I'm glad I booked through them. International traveling is fun but stressful enough.
5	I often use the services of <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> and am very pleased. I like to have online chat constantly, their electronic tickets are adequate language / under state from which they were purchased / service and have different languages ​​and everything is OK.
5	Thanks to Martin Carter for his <http://advise.It|advise.It> was very helpful to me.
1	"Horrible experience and wont advice any friends to book through it. I booked ticket from HYD to SIN via KUL and these guys booked them as separate tickets/PNR.  Airlines denied boarding us because these were separate tickets with two different PNR and we need transit visa if booked as different tickets/PNR. They also informed us if it was single itinerary they would have allowed. Where on Earth people book different itineraries instead of one itinerary. Their customer service quotes one line and wont help you with anything. Better stay away from them. This is reply from them ""your booking was processed automatically, for some technical reason our automatic system booked your tickets with different reference numbers. Please, be informed that we didn’t influence this process in any way. However, it still wouldn’t have caused any problems if you had taken care of your visas in advance."""
4	I like that Skypicker makes for me check-in and I can search flies very simple.
5	Thank you very much for professional help from Julia! She helped me very much. She is great!
3	<http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com>'s 24 hours chatting service is very useful and agents are so kind include Anna Lyt who is contacted by me.But I don't know about booking service. My friend and I use the <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> for the first time, and booked several flight for the trip in the summer vacation. But the price for flight are changed during entering the information for paying, and some of bookings are cancelled suddenly by technical problem. (Airline can't take that price huh?) So we are pushed in the situation that cannot move together in the same trip. Like the agent said, if the <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> send us the E-mail include the solution for that problem, I can edit the number of stars to 5.
5	My problem was solved in a few minutes easily.Thank Sena
5	I was trying to get ticketed for an intra island round trip between two cities in the Philippines. I tried two of the well known online travel companies (EXPEDIA and ASAP). Expedia said no such flight connections existed and tried to route me through Hong Kong for an extra $600. ASAP tried to route me through MANILA for an extra approx $150 (and five hours travel time). I found SkyPicker as I worked my way down the Google pages (they were on the 3rd or 4th page). Their online interface was not all that great, but they did get me good rates on good flights at convienient times. When  my credit card was charged and there was no e-ticket in my email in-box within 5 minutes, I called the telephone number that was featured on their web site (Unlike Expedia which hides their number). I spoke to a woman agent named Kristina B. and she stayed on the phone with me until their system sent me a reservation confirmation, and then she entered my passport and visa information for me (even though those numbers were requested on the reservation form SkyPicker had sent me). Then she stayed on the phone with me for the next few minutes to make sure the numbers satisfied their system. At that point the e-ticket had arrived at my email in-box. Kristina gave me details of the how and when of boarding passes and told me SkyPicker's system would get the boarding passes and send them to my email address.  They also have emergency numbers to call if there are ANY boarding difficulties.They will get ALL my business! I just hope that they continue to hire and train people like Kristina and do not go to some kind of AI system.
5	I discovered Skypicker while researching flights online, I had many questions regarding the flight I was interested in so decided to speak to an agent on the online chat. I spoke with Pavel Fridrich who handled every one of my queries fast and with as much detail as possible. It was really a relief to speak to an agent so quickly and receive such a high level of customer service. I will definitely continue to use Skypicker as it is rare to find such quick customer service even before you have booked any flight. Thank you again Pavel!
5	Vlad is the best person to help you find a solution. He's very understandable and treats you as his best guest.He booked me a new flight and made me calm down after explaining what I went through.I'm very thankful of what he did for me.
5	Carlo Bernardis was extremely polite and helpful in confirming my name change and responding to me on through the support email address when I had tried to follow up with a number of other staff members with no luck.Thank you Carlo!
5	24 chat was brilliant

5	Thank you Kira K. for your help, kindness, patience and effort to solve the mystery of my issues by calling other flight companies. I have never heard via phone any other kind, helpful, undestanding and first of all happy and joyful person as you are Kira.Thanks again for your support and wish you all the best!5star rating for an amazing employee! Kira K!
5	I found the website very user friendly. I like the interface. I made a mistake while booking my tickets about the day and I immediately call the customer service. The communication was perfect and they helped me to solve the problem.
5	Realy excelent! All team members were honest, helpful and I'm appreciated with the service they provided. My flight was cancelled and there were no so much opportunities to travel but Kiwi team done all the best. In spite of the fact that I didn't accept one option they found for me another and I'm very-very happy and thankfull.I wish the best to all of you! ;)
5	Immediate and efficient online chat help to fix the check-in and deliver boarding pass!!
4	First time using Skypicker. I liked that they did online check in for us if available.
5	Just I forgot to give my and my friend details (passport no and so on) in due time. That's why I could not get my boarding pass in time from Skypicker. It was the night before flying, my flight was in early morning. Then I have tried to check in online but could not successful. As well I have seen it will take a good amount charge if I check in airport. That's why I was worried. Then immediately I have contacted with their online customer support. They help me instantly with a good response and send my boarding pass. I think it is a big support for customers to communicate with them for any problem at any time.
5	I had some problems with my flights with cancelling and un-cancelling them. I used the online chat feature in both cases and was pleasently surprised by how nice and helpfull both Kiwi-representatives (Michal & Filip) were. They solved my problem almost immediately and made me feel very well looked after. I can only recommend the online chat, if any problems with flights booked via Kiwi arise. Keep up the good work!
4	Using Skypicker was very easy and helpful. Always find you the cheapest flights and the cheapest days. I will definetly use it again. The only thing why i didn't gave 5 stars is the fee, which could be lower.
5	Highly recommended
1	Don't believe the New Zealand style name, these people are based in the Czech republic which means that if you're in the UK you can't take them to court when they mess up your flight. They managed to leave us less than 1 hour to get from one one side of JFK, through immigration, customs, collect our bags and get to the other side of the airport. Despite admitting their failings in writing they have failed to provide adequate compensation after leaving us stranded in New York late at night. I want to take them to the county court but as they are based in Czecho I am unable to do so. There are lots of competent agents on the world wide web, find one and use them. Avoid these rip off merchants at your peril
3	Smell these guys out before you use them, they stink of thievery and lies
5	My experience with Skypicker has been very positive.The whole service, from the reservation process until getting boarding passes, is easy, intuitive, fast and clear; totally perfect.I don't have any complain.
5	Excellent service, thanks Leonardo! He solved our issue quickly and effectively.
5	I was concerned about checking in early for my flight and Olga came to the rescue. Easy to work with and very accommodating!
2	Dear SkyPicker,First of all I will like to thank you for making ticket orders so much easier. None the less I experienced something outragouesly uacceptable my last travel.I ordered a return trip from Cph-Madrid and flew with Ryanair.Once I get to Cph. Airport I am told that every customer has to check in online or otherwise they'll be charged an extra fee of €45.On my way home I decide to check my mailbox - I have never received any email related to check-in, even though I was promised so, and therefore I have not been able to check in online.3 times I needed to pay the extra fee of €45 which adds up €135 in total. I have no intension to let these payments be my responsibility  and I sincerely hope that you will help me out on this problem.Regards,Emil Elsner Storgaard
5	the assessor  Aliaksandra A help me a lot with my booking problem, congrats to her and her good job.
5	"@skypickercom ""We did our best to find you an alternative and we realize that finding alternatives has taken a long time= skypickerfail"
5	All worked fine. Good prices using different airlines and easy check-in supporting you with boarding cards.

5	Eric was very helpful. He was very patient with me while guiding me through the process of getting my plane ticket on line. Thank you Eric! Kudos to you!
5	I had trouble with checking in online for my flight so I went to Kiwi website and I talked with Tomáš Mužík, an awesome and very polite guy. He was very quick to help me to check in and fixed everything for me! I couldn't have asked for a better customer service, thank you Tomáš and thank you Kiwi! Best Regards
5	Daniel help us while having to cancel and look for new flights, always gave us the best advice, and inform us of the detailed situation in every step! I wish i can contact directly with him every time!
5	Very good client support! Really fast and kind. I will recommend skypicker to my friends.
3	Don't make booking with <http://skypicker.com|skypicker.com>.  they will deduct money from your card without any reason.
5	Awesome customer chat service on the site. Anastassia did an awesome job finding the problem I had and fixing it instantly.
5	Merci beaucoup a Eric, assistant de <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> qui m'a aidé franchment vite et en plus dans le question quand j'etais sur deja que mon ticket d'avion est perdu!
5	I had an problem with my reservation and your colleague helped me a lot to change the mistake I made. It was very easy to change since you have a posibility of chat. So Yuriy N. made it very comfortable. I can´t wait for travel with your company. :)
4	There had been an error with booking in and a lovely/super helpful staff member named Ondra sorted out very quickly for me.
1	My experience with Skypicker was absolutely dreadful. A flight from Malaysia to India was cancelled and even though the company sent me an email saying please choose an alternate flight and if you don't choose, it will automatically change to the new recommended flight, it didn't change. This resulted in at 15 hour halt in KL airport. After trying to contact them several times from KL, they said they would investigate and get back to me and they didn't for nearly 3-4 hours after which I booked the flight myself. While waiting, they also advised they can't book any accommodation inside the airport even though the Skypicker guarantee advises this should be done for any halts over 8 hours. On reaching back home, I realised they refunded the KL-India flight even though the new flight cost me much more. I have since lodged a complaint on 28th Jan and not received a response yet resolving the matter. I would highly recommend that this service not be used.
5	Today, Zuzana and Issis helped me to resolve a problem with online check in. The service is as always quick and professional.I even wanted to post a photo here... instead I will describe it: a selfy with a happy face and a boarding pass:)
4	Helpful and nice customer representative Dave. He wasn't able to answer my request right away so checked with his manager. She was not able to answer either so we hung up. 2 minutes later Dave rang me back. He had Googled my query and found an answer on his own initiative. That's what i call good service!
5	So attentive and got all of my questions answered.  Eased all of my worries during a hectic cancelled flight.  So thankful for his help!
1	There seems to be one big different then to other booking companies. My booking has 4 different airlines. Kiwi. com does not manage to bring them all together as other booking companies do. There is no luggage send through to final destination, if you want to change or even cancel a booking that is a major headache. Has to be done one by one. Chat-Service seems to be very unprofessional. Only replies to question that might be easy to reply. You have to ask several times until they consider to answer your specific question.In case of cancellation- big problem.  The chat-service offers to cancel but can not tell you how much you will loose. The answer is, you wait and see how much they will refund. Really, that's your service??? Only after a long time they agree to ask the airlines before you have to make your decision.I also got some wrong information and 5min later she wrote the opposite.Not satisfying service at all. Very poor.

5	@skypickercom great work guys, we hope 2016 is even more prosperous :)
1	Since I had twice a not proceed bookings after their offer some flights not available any longer without a suitable solution, I'm no able to recommend this agency.
5	First time using Kiwi and I had a great experience. Order process was very easy and great prices. I made a mistake on my order and Huri B fixed it right away, free of charge. A+ service.
5	I was assisted by Tomas through the online chat - he was absolutely first class...I'd highly recommend the company and it's support team. :-)
5	Eric from the <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> help line was particularly helpful.
5	Just contacted Bek through the website chat. Helped me a lot and really fast about visa regulations. Really nice and fast service!
5	I booked flights to Belfast and return from Dublin to Birmingham for 8 people very easy and all in one place. I noticed in e ticket i had made a spelling mistake for one name and a title for another! Phoned customer services and explained and they sorted it out within the day over two different airlines and with no extra costs as bonus! Thank you
5	I'm very pleased with this service, the person who helped me (Jiří Červenka) was very useful and solved my problem straight away. Thank you!
5	"I love how it lets you to find flights to ""anywhere"" just listing the cheapest options. For a travel fanatic it's very nice.Also, it's great that you don't have to set a certain date and can use a time interval."
5	They replied to my demand so fast and did give the best solution. Thank you very much,Arda
1	They booked me two different flights to get to my destination and I couldn't read that anywhere. They checked for me in so I didn't have to do that. I checked on my e-ticket, which they sent me, if I can bring a carry on. And it said yes!! At the airport I had 2 pay than for two carry on's for two different flights, because the airline does not provide carry on's. When I called the site, after I paid they said I should send them the recieves and they will refund me. Now after 6 weeks I am still running after it and every time when I text them, they come with the same answer that I had an otherweight luggage, what is definitely not true. I sent them my recieves where it says that I have to pay for a regular carry on and my boarding passes where it says the same and I showed them on the Internet site of the airline that they do not provide carry on's, but they still won't listen and pretend like it's my fault. Anyways this site is texting me for weeks the same and every time when I call they have no clue what I am taking about.
5	I spoke to the support before I booked my flight if I could get additional luggage and they told me, that for one flight I'd have to book it extra after I booked my flight. So I booked it and spoke to the support right afterwards again. They made a query to the airline and a few hours later I had my extra luggage.Also the waiting time in the queue is quite short!
5	I wanted to change my flight...and i wanted the cheapest ratethey helped me and response very quick on my emails.My ticket is changed just how i wanted itThanks great and helpfull people!chantal
5	I'm yet to travel with SkyPicker as my flight is booked for the end of June, but as I wasn't sure about some details on my e-ticket, I gave them a call to clarify.I was assisted by a lovely gentleman called James Tickner who took the time to listen to my query and helped me resolve the issue, he also made sure to email me following our call to reassure me that the information he gave me was correct and I'm going to receive an updated e-ticket.I'm so far impressed with the customer service and hopefully I'll have a fantastic experience travelling with them.Thank you James, you're awesome!
5	"Agent Puput helped me a lot, to find ""lost"" ticket. Great service,:)"
5	Our flights were booked by Kiwi and everything went smoothly.  I had a question regarding the airline's warning about needing a visa, and Kiwi was able to answer my question using chat.  Friendly chat session too.
1	I sent email to skypicker and got some info to change the schedule and add luggage. When I tried to change from web-site, I couldn't succeed so I've tried to contact via LiveChat, email, phone to request my change.LiveChat did nothing to my question except saying I have to send email to skypicker. I sent email. no response from email. I called skypicker. The guy from phone also said me that I have to just send email for my change request. she confirmed that they will response my email soon by checking schedule change with flight carrier. So in order to catch quickly. I sent it again. No response until now. I waited for 1 day. I don't understand why I have to wait for 1 day to get response for my change request.Why does skypicker have LiveChat and phone for contact ? They keep saying that I have to send email. Then Why does skypicker have email for main contact for request handling ? Email doesn't give me response in 1 day.I really need this change in 5 hours. If not, I have to give up flight ticket.If you need help from them, you will need to wait long time or may not get response from them. Just use another site.
5	Great support on the live chat, solved my problem quickly and without any wait!
5	Thank you for the help Babak, you was wonderful and helpful. I recommend that company for your bookings.
1	"I am super disappointed by Skypicker service- Not just it's annoying when you have to write your passport details for check-in twice if you choose a return flight... but after this all you get to the airport, where you aren't checked-in at all for one of those flights, so you have to pay for it at the airport (90 EUR per 2 person)... the lady at the desk in Bratislava airport mentioned it's not the first time she deals with Skypicker's mistake of this kind... no help and refund from Skypicker... next time I will not travel ""low cost""...and I will tell all my friends be aware of Skypicker practices"
5	I had a problem with the air company and I needed to put in contact several times with Kiwi tam support. They were always really helpful and patint, and they did the maximum effort to solve my problem. Sadly, I don't remember all their names, just Catalina and Juan Mena-Costa. Thank you so much!Thanks also to Maria P., who send me a really kind message suggesting to write a commentary on Juan Mena. She is a great colleague.
5	Michaela O. thank you very much! You are real man of the game!
1	My Girlfriend and I used Skypicker for a flight from Malaga to Copenhagen Via London (luton). W had 5 hours in Luton before our connecting flight, more than enough you would think. Our plane from Malaga got rerouted to Liverpool though, and we where told to get a taxi to Luton by the personel, so we did. We came too late to our connecting flight, and everyone told us they couldnt help us cause we had bought our tickets trough skypicker, and we couldn't get a hold of skypicker, so we arranged a hotel until we could get a new flight home a few days later. All in all it costed us almost 1000 euro extra, and 2 lost working days. And now they cant help us with any compensation of any sorts, STAY AWAY!
5	Professional support give by Ira. I am happy to discover kiwi. com . Simple the Best The staffe Ira was fantastic prompt and abble to resolve my issue.thanks a lot
5	I wanna thank you Milica, I was just want to change my dates about the flight tickets, and I was tired almost 3 house to asked the other 2 worker to figure out why i can't payment, god... finally, I tried again online chat, fortunately i chat with Milica, very smart and quickly to know that reason why i can't payment and help me to writing the link, very professional, thank you, Milica.Shaia
4	I have booked a flight recently. Support team was very helpful in relation to luggage queries and legislations. I'm delighted with prompt emails and support.
5	I recommend personally calling <http://Kiwi.Com|Kiwi.Com> for any assistance you might need. This morning I spoke to Eric who guided me through the process of changing a passenger name, updating passenger ID numbers and made recommendations on how best to change the outbound date for a single passenger from a group booking. He was polite and professional at all times and I couldn't be happier with his service. Many thanks for your assistance, Alex Wallis
5	That was my first Skypicker booking and I'm totally satisfied. Thanks a lot :)

1	This is the wurst Company experience ever and my man and I have decide we will never use this company agin!!!! You buy ticket then they want you to pay extra after for the suitcase have never had that experience with other company before!!!!
5	it was quick and solve my problem. Thank you!
5	My name is Qasim Bapeer ,As I wasn't to sure of where I am meant to be I decided to give SkyPicker a call. A lovely girl answered me : called Katyrina , she produced an wonderful job in helping me with every detail that I needed for my flight. I hope all the workers at the customer service are as polite and wonderfully trained as Katyrina. Thank you .
5	I have to take my time to write this review to find a way to express how thankful I am with the Kiwi agents, (yes, the humans who answers your questions in the Live Chat).Purchasing a ticket for me represent much more than getting on the plane, and I am sure every person have a different story. In my case a family reunion after some years and some stories. The process of buying the ticket was already overwhelming for me, among trying to find the best price + emotions + how to bring my surfboard etc...i was not able to do it by myself. I log in the Live Chat to ask for help and express my concerns and what I needed. For my surprise, i found a supportive agent who was taking my request as a challenge and an opportunity! she (Anastasia) was so engaged in find the best deal for me... unfortunately the bad internet I had made me loose our chat...so I have to come back and find another agent to keep the work.I thought it was bad luck that I lost this super helpful girl. For my surprise, the next agent who got my case was more than ready to help me out...Mikael took my requests with full commitment, as he mentioned, he put on his gloves, make some stretches to warm up and got totally into the mission to find the best deal.Every time I log into the LIVE CHAT, even to ask the silliest question, I find people like Mikael and Anastasia, they are not there only to sell you a ticket or to answers like robots your questions.What makes <http://KIWI.COM|KIWI.COM> stand out are these humans. They are more than agents, they really know that purchasing a ticket means meeting your parents or love ones, making a life shift, step over fears or just go to find your live purposes.Thank you guys for being so passionate, full of patience, positive and carrying this huge sense of empathy.My best of the best wishes for youYanneth
4	<http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>, Anastassia, Lukas and Elsa helped me with my booking, since I happened to miss to write some details. Everything went well and I am glad they could help me so smoothly! Thank you!
4	I had not received confirmation of my flights but used the live chat service just now and a girl called Gabi was very helpful.  she tracked down my flights and resent my confirmation email with all the details.  Thanks Gabi
5	Excellent service. In my booking I wrote my email wrong and I have been concerned about my reservation.  I wrote them an email and I have got a response within a few minutes, even though it was during night and everything was solved. Anna T. is the consultant that helped me, great job!! I am really impressed. :)
5	This is the first time I have dealt with Skypicker - have booked return flights from Sydney to London in December. There was a problem with checking in my luggage which was resolved promptly with the Skypicker team.  I also had a few questions that needed answering, once again, the email response from them was very quick and the enquiries were dealt with promptly and efficiently.   I dealt mainly with  Vadim Vaschenko and Natalya Petrishina, both of whom were very efficient.  Nothing was any trouble to them and will definitely recommend Skypicker to anyone.
5	Excellent customer support for my multiple tickets booked within India! Will use them again and recommend for courteous and professional service.
5	Excellent Service by Natalya. She was helpful and kind! Our online tickets never arrived and she helped us sort everything the night before our flight! THANK YOU
5	jan is so kind and helpful ... i was so happy with jan... thank you jan.
5	I had several questions about the booking, spoke to Aliaksandra and Kostya while prebooking and later to Kostya once again. I received answers to all my questions and now I am looking forward to my trip, sure, that in case of any need I will receive help from <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com>
5	Les Cuento que es la primera vez que recibo un excelente servicio de parte de las empresas de venta de tiquetes aereos. Para mi esta nueva empresa tiene excelente personal, como el Sr. Leonardo Paredes de la <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>, el cual me resolvio' un grave problema. Me hizo seguimiento hasta el final de la compra del tiquete, llamandome hasta que me resolvio el problema. Nunca habia tenido un excelente servicio asi, casi todas estas empresas tienen numeros telefonicos con cargos costosos y la camunicacion tramite correo electronico es bastante lenta y fraccionada. La <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> ademas tiene un buen servicio de Chat, la sensacion que tuve con el Sr Leonardo Paredes fue que no me dejo solo en este viaje y ahora me regreso feliz con este servicio, ademas tiene un excelente precio de tiquetes, los cuales puedes comprar por separado la ida o el regreso, muchas gracias Sr Leonardo Paredes y <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>
5	I am very pleased with the level of support I received from <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> and specifically from Lucie F. and Patricia I. I had a connection flight that I nearly missed. Before I had a chance to contact the company, Lucie and Patricia reached out to me to see if I wanted to change my connecting flight.
3	We're experiencing issues with our phone lines. Please contact us via email and chat while we work to resolve the issue. Skypicker team
1	As per Josh review there were 2 tickets the point here is not the compensation this was to attend his fathers funeral had kiwi not messed him about from 11.30 to 5pm and come clean on the issues I would have been in a position to book alternative options which were available during the day. They are. NOT transparent and have emotionally ruined us hope I do not and will never trust this company who have no customer service what so ever -  there will be many more reviews about this
1	"I've requested change of my flight, got prompt answer from the helpdesk, however they've offered me to make the change for a fee. Later I found this fee equals to price of a new ticket plus ten percent commission, and there is no refund for the old ticket.  I do not think this is fair, hence I give only one star, since two star rating is already labeled as ""fair"". Skypicker is a great service to discover new routes at competitive prices, but it offers no extra value when booking direct flights."
5	<http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> provides affordable and quality service. Best part of their service from their correspondents. I called and chat several agents and they were very attentive and careful and solved my problem. I can' not name all of them but   Pavel Burian is one of them. Thank you Pavel
5	Zdenka worked to get my vacation back on track after a serious delay. Fantastic service!
3	@Naemless1 Thank You for understanding. On behalf of Skypicker Team, Ana
5	I was skeptical when I saw this company. Took me considerable time to decide if this company is trustable or not. So i contacted the customer service agent many times to double check. Everything was okay. I was really worried about credibility of this company. I can tell you this company is fine as long as you don't mess up anything when you book with them. Also I booked with a Ryanair. I was notified my bording pass would be ready a month later when I booked which made me really stressful because I live in different country zone had to wait like 2 days after all. I hope they could charity me the specific time when my boarding pass would be ready. Other than that everything was fantastic.
3	@wizzair Hello I have a booking made via Skypicker and would like to add a bag, how could I proceed?
5	I called in to <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> to check on my booking status for flights as I had received by booking confirmation so soon and had trouble locating my PNR number.

4	They gave me much better prices and a great variety of alternatives for my flight in a complicated vacation period after I had been looking among many others and feeling desperate to find a flight for travelling on business.At the end just had a minor inconvenience at the time of invoicing because I needed the invoice with the same currency I made the payment.Thanks!María
5	I was worry about my flight on the next day, but after I used the chat portal and after few minutes waited. I have talked with Patrik and he was really a big help it took less than 10 minutes for him to help me fix my own error.
5	I had an issue with not 1 but 3 of my bookings and used Kiwi's help chat to communicate with one of their representatives. I was so lucky to get Lenka. Extremely kind, helpful and so prompt and efficient to help me solve my problem. It honestly went a lot smoother than I thought it would and for that I'm so thankful. Thank you Kiwi! and thank you Lenka!
5	I have very good experince with <http://Skypicker.com|Skypicker.com>. I bought last minute flight tickets from Prague to Frankfurt. Price was lowest in this time. I liked the fast communication. I needed commercial invoice. After short communications through live chat, invoice I received to e-mail.
5	I am grateful for the excellent customer service kiwi has, I made a booking and the chat window helped a lot to clarify certain things. thanks especially for Zdenka and Samael who were there to respond to all my questions and provide me with the necessary informations
5	I got help with my booking from a guy called Vally. Am really happy with his service and appriciate the fast service i got as well.
4	I had to change my passport information at the last moment and was tended to by Katerina Entlerova. She was helpful and my boarding passes were mailed in time as she offered. I've booked flights with skypicker/kiwi twice with no issues. I hope their quality service holds.
5	Quick and easy booking with fair prices and nice interface.Easy to understand what is happening and you can manage your booking as well easily.
4	I wasn't able to do the online check-in on time, but after talking via the live chat to Sena from their assistance team, I got my situation fixed really quickly!
1	This is the worst travel agent and worst customer support i lost 1000$ because off this kiwi and people plz don't book any tickets in this website it's my request
5	The agent Lusine was amazing. Very useful and always very kind.
5	I contacted the customer service because I have a stop over in Dublin and wasn't sure where to check-in online since the ticket said it would be required or else I might have to pay a charge if I check in at the airport. The customer service Jakub P. was very helpful and told me that they will do the check-in for me and I will receive the boarding pass after that via email. Hope everything goes as planned. :)
1	"I booked a one way ticket for 91$ including 15 kg luggage. The flight is provided by Ryanair. For this reason I checked the price of my flight on the Ryanair website (unfortunately, I did this after buying the ticket from <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>).What I found was really surprising for me. I expected slightly higher price caused by <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> guarantees and other additional services.  The same flight with the same 15 kg luggage was offered by Ryanair for 53$. That means that the difference in the prices was almost 40$ and <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> offer was higher by nearly 70%!!!When I examined it more deeply, I found out that the prices of the flight tickets (excluding the luggage) are the same. Therefore, the whole difference is caused by unreasonably higher price of the additional luggage. I cannot see the point.I exchanged many emails with <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> support - they insisted on the fact that the difference is caused by the ""benefits"" provided by <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>. Does that mean that if I would not buy the additional luggage, I could not make use of these benefits? They were not able to explain it neither to help me somehow.For me, this was the ""never again"" type of purchase."
1	I had a fligth change for my second flight on my very home.Skyjacker told me they were able to get me alternative flights if i would like that. I did!Then the problems startet. 4 days and a big telefonebill later, I had to get home, still without any new tickets. Skypicker had the worst service ever:They did not answer my mail before 1 or 2 days, on the phone they wanted me to send mail, when I contacted them on mail, they wanted me to phone. Several people promised, that NOW they where going to mail me the new tickets, but they newer appeared.It seems like Skypicker provied ok service if everything is playing by the book, but in time of trouble, they do their best to avoid helping you.I did get home by doing the impossible. I used my old tickets (it was, by the way, way hard to get the boarding cards from Skypicker) and changed flights in Stansted airport with 25 min. between flights.I will never use Skypicker again.

5	Thank you Bachana Kuprashvili for responding to my enquiry within like 10 minutes and changing my details, which I had entered incorrectly on the website!Best wishes,Vidmantas Zidonis
5	Very helpful and did our check in for us and sent it to my email.All very simple and fast.
5	I had several request of different natures, from cancelling one of my reservations, requesting refund, asking for name correction, reservation of meal and request for assistance and priorito boarding. All was solved and I was guided with patiente and detail by Lukas P. Much appriciated. I usually dont have a good experience with callin airlines or booking agencies. Actually it has been a nightmare in the past. But this went smooth and effective, Thanks again!
5	Due to weather my flight to Richmond was cancelled > Kiwi personnel was very prompt in finding me an alternative flight and thus assuring that I could make it back home. Everyone is super friendly and competent. Especially Elani , who spent quite time calling the airlines and calling me back , always within half an hour at the most. Kiwi has some of the nest people I ever encountered.Thanks!Lorenza
5	@spendingsmart Great airline news & spending tips! Your readers may be interested in spending smart on airfare with <https://t.co/6MN8N4GW19>.
5	This is my first time i have used your service to check for a flight. I had some questions before buying a ticket and tried the online chat  I got connected to Milica and she was awesome. She answered all my questions and gave me some advice and helped me to chose the best day for my flight. She was very positive regardless of my kind of silly questions.It was really a great experience. P.S.Filip M. helped me with the reference number
4	The flights were smooth. I liked the prices, and got no problem with my online tickets being honored. It would have been nice to have wifi and a TV screen on a couple of the flights, but I understand these were on low-cost airlines and plus I wanted to sleep anyway. My only real issue is that I actually was entitled to one checked bag and to a meal on two of my bookings on this multi-city flight--but I hadn't been informed about these privileges in advance
4	I had som problems with my check in and called the customer service. Emer answerd and understood my problem and he helped me. I later contacted them by their chat system and Tamar took my check in information and gave me my boardning passes.
4	I had several questions about my flight transfers. Petra M. was very helpful and was able to settle my questions well. Thank you Petra M.
5	I was doubting at the bigging as it was my first time to read the name Skypicker. I tried to find other familiar agency but it appeared to be just Skypicker. I took my chance and I really appreciate the service and update informations I received both sms and mail. Specially I was so happy for the online check in the Skypicker did on behalf of me.
5	They are very helpful about cancelling and refunding your tickets if you've made a mistake. Very quick and helpful service.. I received great support by Dmitriy D. one of the live chat people from skypicker with this request.
4	Thanks for the support to Kira - its been dufficult to sit here in Denmark on a Sunday and get Any support in the airport up here.
4	"Ksenia. B in ""Live Chat"" help me much, she is kindness=)"
5	Airline sites can be messy and choosing flights and connections can be time-consuming. Kiwi makes it all super easy, user-friendly and intuitive. Actually I couldn't believe it worked so flawlessly. Definitely going to use it again for all my future trips.
5	you're an awesome company with the strictest security my wife and I have ever dealt with along with the cheapest fares as in saving over $300.00 on my wife's flight this morning. Thank you for your service!
5	Web chatted to Kiwi Rep Valentin. Was extremely helpfully and answered all of my queries satisfactorily
4	First time user and had no problems at all.Glad i found you to make the journey a bit cheaper.
4	"This was the first time I used Kiwi and they helped me find a very economic flight...that involved two legs with two different airlines.  The service was great...with one surprise...since I flew Spirit airlines for one-leg my carry-on baggage was not included in the original price I paid to Kiwi and I had to pay $50 more just to carry baggage on board.The service on my second flight was excellent.So, if you notice your quote includes a discount airline...be sure they are charging you for the necessary luggage upfront, as that can change the ""good price"" you are getting.  Watch for surprises!"
5	The compagny cancelled the flight I orgininally chose for safety reasons and gave me another one the same day. I could make it so I sent an email to them. As soon as I contacted I had a really fast answer and my demand has been treated in two days. I have a new flight now, for the same day and at the time I wanted. They also offered me to refund the entire flying ticket if I wasn't happy to change for another time. I recommend a hundred times Adam Jelinek who completely understood my needs and has been really efficent in his job. Thank you
4	First flight delayed so missed connecting flight with another airline company. Kiwi offered a rebooking and hotel at no cost, but was a bit slow in responding. In the meantime we had managed ourselves to change flights so we didn't need overnight say. Overall good service despite low price.
4	I m really happy with this website . I can see the prices for each day and it is really hand. And the prices are cheap.The staff well , I can't tell anything wrong all the time I called them they answered me promptly and kindly. *One thing about the automatically emails with the quantity of luggage the sometimes it diverted
5	It was awesome :D the customer support answered all my insecurities :D
4	I booked many flights as I live overseas and have a large family. <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> is a company I know I can trust when I make a booking. When there's been adjustments or changes, their online chat has been really helpful. Especially as I don't want to make overseas phone calls.
5	I didnt do online check in and my flight was in 24hrs, so I contacted Kiwi helpdesk. Lukas P helped me with it. It was clear and fast. I would like to thank you Lukas P that you helped me with this problem.Cheers Peter
5	I came upon them by chance, ( when they were still called skipicker) when trying to find tickets to malaga in june that we cld afford, i'd never heard of them and was nervous making the booking. (And when their name changed a few days later!) But in fact i found them to be not only the cheapest but the most helpful budget company iv delt with. Having daid that, nothing went wrong on the journey so i had no need to contact them directly, i only used the pho previded once , befor booking, to make sure it worked..! It did :)
5	Patrik's assistance was superb.His answers were clear and the information I received from him was very helpful.Thanks again!
5	I have nothing but good things to say about kiwi and its representatives.  I recently had a delayed flight that caused me to miss a connecting flight.  This was obviously the most stressful time for me,  but kiwi worked hard to ensure I would find a replacement flight and put my mind at ease.  They kept me updated on everything they were doing for me, and when I chatted with them online, they were super helpful. I would absolutely book through kiwi again.  They went above and beyond to take care of me, making sure I made it to my final destination.  Thank you, kiwi.  Keep up the great work!
5	I would recommend this site to anyone. Customer support helped a lot,  Alan Whitfield helped to cancel one of my flights and was very supportive. The site is easy to use and navigate, would definitely use again.
5	Although it was my first booking through the Skypicker, I´d never regret. They saved my holiday that was just about to be spoiled by a Turkish Airline deleyed flight from Budapest to Istanbul on January 23 evening. We missed our connection to Asia, therefore also a connection with low-cost airliner Air Asia. I called Skypicker at midnight, they answerd immediately and swiftly changed my connection flight with Air Asia for the next day. Amazing! All done within just two phone calls. 1st - request, 2nd - data confirmation. Skypicker Guarantee simply works. And perfectly !

5	I asked change one of the passenger's nationality. The assisstant  changed for me very fast and help me to make a change for free. Thank you
1	It is very very difficult to get the money back when you can't take your plane for medical reasons, even with kiwi dot com own inssurance! I could get my money back.
5	'Tomas' was really helpfull. He answered all my questions clearly and was really kind. Thank you!
5	Excellent service from Skypicker Support, great prices and reliable system. I have been using Skypicker for over two years now and their service is very efficient, easy to use and you get the best value for money. Thank you Luis S. for you help with my return trip. Have a wonderful Christmas guys and keep up the good work!
4	@skypickercom thanks I shall now patiently wait for ur call
4	decent treatment and very little friction
5	"I am amazed by the service from Skypicker. I had two issues that I needed help with after my booking and both of them were solved fast, efficiently and with a very nice tone of voice. At the end of the conversation I was wished to ""Have a lovely day"". You rarely get that kind of extra concern today and I really appreciated it. For me it is excellent with such an efficient and nice service and these consultants really saved lots of time and struggle for me. I was in immediate contact with both Martin Mikes, Jolana Dominguez, Klara Pestal, Erol Guliyev and Johana Kodytkova. All of them just made my day. Thank you!"
5	My husband needed to book a flight for my son. At first the online payment was rejected by our bank. We went on the live chat service and spoke to Mayyas who held our hand through the transaction which did take a while. She was very patient. These transactions are never without stress. Well done from us
4	"In the booking page, when I wanted to enter my email address in the ""Email"" field, it didn't allow me to enter alphabets, I can only enter digits."
5	Neil Camilleri is the man of the house! By that I mean he is a super awesome human being who just saved me more than 150 bucks by finding me the best deals I couldn't find on my own. Smart. Intelligent. Funny. This guy and his customer service skills deserves a promotion and a high five. You go Kiwi! (and Niel) :)

5	Milica and Thomas both did everything they could to clear up any and all confusion I had that stemmed from Asia Airlines. Milica and Thomas both worked together to help me complete booking for a new flight and made transparent any and all fees that could've snuck up on me later on. Very impressed by the effort they put in to ensure satisfaction.
5	Excellent service and got my baggage allowance increased thank you so much very good and best airline booking website
5	I would like to say Thank you so much dear Anna Enna the person who i talked on phone and helped me to solve the problem with the tickets what i buyed . The problem was solved because Anna was a nice girl and speaked beautiful and speaked carefuly with me for understanding :) I would like to say Good luck to skypicker and we would keep in touch more ! :)
1	Booking via Skyjacker is literally one of my worst mistakes. Its given me nothing but headaches. 1.They say I have 0 checked baggages -> Upon incessant inquiries I'm informed that I have one bag unto 15Kgs free.2. REMOVING the convenience of self web check in to make my journey more comfortable. I am never going to use it and will advice against it. Any online service is supposed to ease the customer experience and not aggravate it.
5	Being a tall guy 1.95 cm I like seat allocation on my flights. I was to late but Kiwi managed to book me a seat next to an empty one.
5	Wow,  when I got my quote I thought the prices were to good to be true. The fares were Au$400 cheaper than anybody else, but they were fantastic. Have told heaps of friends about Skypicker, we will be back!
5	I had a huge problem with my ticket. I booked an $800 ticket with insurance at <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> and soon realized I had to cancel. I contacted <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> multiple times with different people trying to help me but they all fell short. Then, I contacted Kiwi once more and this time I was connected with a woman named Sofia Kallas. From the beginning of the conversation, due to my frustrations of being helped by other incompetent representatives, I was pretty pushy and a bit rude. Despite my angry attitude, Ms. Kallas was helpful from the very first second! She spent over an hour on chat helping me, calling the airlines involved, speaking with her manager, and answering EVERY one of my questions! She wrote in good English and she was easy to follow. Ms. Kallas spoke with her manager right away to see what she could do for me and then went on to contact multiple airlines on my behalf. She did her very best from start to finish and never got upset with my attitude. In short, she put up with me and remained helpful and professional throughout. <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> should really thank their representative, Sofia Kallas, since if it weren't for her, I would've given a 1 star rating instead of a 5. She really saved the day and helped me get almost all my money back. Some of you might think that this is normal, but the way she went above and beyond was definitely special! Her colleagues just said I would receive an email within in an hour and abruptly ended our chat... I never got the email. Her colleagues fell short and didn't help me and only wasted my time. With time pressing, Sofia came through and handled everything for me and did EVERYTHING she could. Without her help and hard work I would probably be missing out on $800 dollars. So again, thank you so very very much, Sofia!10/105 stars100%A+- Elazar :)

3	A new app from Expedia or any other booking agent will be good but dont travel with these useless pricks
5	I had a very pleasant journey , I was happy for safety and accuracy . Which I think could be improved , for a service to a reduced outward journey to the airport for those who are traveling with you .
5	It's 23:42 and they still have live chat to help online. Amazing. Thank u for all ur help.
1	I am furious with this company! I booked a flight which they then, 2 hrs later, didn't process due to a technical error! It was still advertised at the same price so I booked the same flight again. I was then told that that the booking couldn't be completed because there had been a change in price and I would have to pay more than double what I had originally been asked to pay!!! This was the scam!!! I was able to book direct with the airline for much less than the new price this company were asking for and I have emails and screen grabs to prove it! I am so disgusted with this company. NEVER EVER USE THEM!!! PLUS I'VE TRIED TO POST THIS REVIEW 3 TIMES AND EACH TIME IT HAS DISAPPEARED!!!
1	I am in Manila where there are three terminals of the same airport only they are not in the same building but actually quiet a drive from each other so when I ask from which terminal my flight departs, they say they do not have this information, I should go and ask at the airport... and also the fact that the ticket is purchased through them means that there is a possibility the airline will not find your information (so it says on the warnings once you get the eticket) so... overall worst transaction ever
5	Easy online booking without any problems, everything went just as expected. The flight itself also without any problems.R.
5	Super happy with the service provided by kiwi! would recommend 10/10
5	My flight was cancelled by the airline. Kiwi informed me of the problem and their online chat agent Tomas managed to completely sort out a perfect alternative flight for us. Thanks Tomas
5	Julia was really helpful and effective. Great attention!
5	Natali was great!
5	my flight was cancelled , it was followed by 2 more flights , I asked for refund and I got it.
5	We used <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> two times the last two months for booking a trip. For both tickets we needed more information about the visa requirements and the possibility to change a flight. You good reach them at every moment by phone or chat, and the were very helpful.
5	I needed help changing my personal details for my flight. Jan Lukasek responded to my request very quickly and helped me to resolve the issue.
5	I initially called to cancel my flight due to short connection time travelling to Japan. After few email exchanges, I was assured that the connection time is enough for the destination I'm going. To my surprise, the customer care officer followed up by giving me a call to my mobile personally to assure me. This is the best customer service experience. I went through the flight without any hiccup. Thank you SkyPicker!
5	Niel was very helpful, kind and straight to the point! Positive experience
1	"I decided to book flights with <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> because of their prices and their <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> guarantee. After miissing my international flight due to a booking error between <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> and VivaColombia Airlines  in early Dec 2016 which cost me over $400 out of my pocket because of their mistake, <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> says they will only refund $200 (even though Kiwi.xom customer service recognized the error was not mine) which is less than their stated policy and as of Jan 28, 2017 I am still waiting to receive my refund. I have been told that my refund was misplaced, misdirected, the finance dept has been unable to refund my debit card, unable to effect a bank transfer because the information given was wrong which is a lie..someone in finance entered the wrong information. They are unable or unwilling to apply my refund to my Paypal account.  I have received more excuses as to why I haven't received my refund even though I have involved shift supervisors in CS. Everyone gives me their word that they will ""take care of this matter"" and  nothing happens.  Do NOT use this company to book your flight. If there is a conflict you will not be taken care of and you will be out of pocket according to my experience. I have finally come to realize that even though I have complied with every thing asked of me.and my booking refrence number is marked REFUNDED..i HAVEN'T RECEIVED A PENNY and apparently I don't have much chance of seeing a refund. Save yourself money and aggrivation and book through someone else"
5	Thanks Martin Carter for answering my questions so quickly, friendly  and thoroughly - You totally helped me out and you are the reason that I will be booking through skypicker - Thank you!!

4	I'm in the UK, the flights are to Thailand and India, the number I called was a UK number but the call centre is in the Czech Republic, my customer service person was Spanish speaking, the website said it would send me a new password but didn't - I had my doubts about how all this would work but Leonardo Paredes was very helpful and good at handling a slightly stressed-out client and I have now resolved the issue (subject to the website processing the new information). I feel reassured about the flights and am looking forward to my trip.

5	My family (wife and three children) was due to leave a week earlier to spend the holidays in Italy, when I still had to stay in work. I had booked myself two scheduled flights from HEL to CPH and from CPH to BGY by Kiwi-agency. However, the 13 year-old son had suddenly to stay with me at home, and I booked him the same flights but directly through the airline companies. Check-in was not successful, however, without the agency Mohamed Abdelkader help. He was very friendly and took care of airline companies with linkages to my son attached to my companion. Many thanks to Mohamed, you saved our trip! Next time, we will reserve all our flights through the travel agency Kiwi :)
5	Today I had an 13 hours of busdrive from Nah Tran to Hoi An. This morning (16/8/2016) I booked a flight ticket for Hanoi to BKK airport. I was so tired and accidentally booked a flight for 26 September instead of 26 august. I went on the live chat to figure out how I can change the date for my flight as I have no more money left to pay the fee to change date or buy another flight ticket. The one who helped me was  Adam Jelínek. This person helped me so much and went beyond! He figured out what the best options there is for me and replayed quickly on the messages. I am so happy with the service of <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> and will definitely recommend this company. Thank you <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> and Adam Jelinek for the great services!
5	Lucie O'Bryan, did a efficient solution for my problems. Very clear in what was needed of me and easy to communicate with. Thanks for the help :)

1	Attempted to purchase tickets and site failed to have them but our card was charged and getting money back has been horrible! Email with refund options didn't work at first, when we selected an option (Paypal) to get funds back as soon as possible - they say 24 hours or less - there is yet more issues. It's since been 3 days and we're still waiting with serious doubts that the money is coming.Phone service is the worst I've experienced, only way to get any response is through online support. Will never make the mistake of booking with Skypicker again!
4	I had contact with Lydie. I wanted to cancel a reservation. But it was not possible.Support by chat was a efficient service.

5	She's great in helping ^^
1	Very very disoppointed. The worst ever service and experience I am going a head to sue these guys they have no idea. Just cheap is no good they dodge people and do not Guide properly. Please do not use them.
2	Generally, is a good site because it has very good prices and a variety of choices. I had a bad experience as I had a change in flights, I paid for that and 5 days before my flight you sent me wrong tickets with the previous dates. Fortunately, you sent the correct tickets very quickly. Moreover, the service they provide for the check in is helpless (the fact that you do the check in for the customer). In that case I cannot manage my flight I cannot choose my seat and I cannot have several other benefits that every company (Ryanair, BA etc) offer in its platform. I don't care if you use your e-mail to book the tickets and you can't provide the details. I have paid for them and I want to manage them. Also in that way you can't have your tickets in QR code for example in the Passbook application in iPhone like the most people.
5	Thank for kood service and fast answer for booking system big thanks for ioussef souini
4	Cheapest price due to booking with local discount companies... No checked luggage, and customs to cross + multiple check ins... But it all went perfect
5	I wanted to add hold luggage after checked-in, but could not find the option to do directly on airline website. All was sorted by Lucie.Really appreciate thatThank you again
5	The process of booking was smooth and I did not face any difficulties. No need to contact customer service, I definitely reccomend <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> to everyone. I can not wait to book a flight again.

5	Its my first time using <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> and the fantastic help i got is truly amazing. I liked the smart chat solution that they have which does not waste time of both parties and collects all the information in advance. The person i was chatting with was to the point and was very helpful.thanks
1	I booked wrong date mistakenly and want to refund or want to change my flight.They said they can't refund my ticket because they don't have refund policy.I booked estar airline and I know this airline has refund policy.They would take $50 and can cancel ticket.Why they can't do it? I can't understand. I told them just take cancel fee then refund my ticket but they said can't.So i asked please change another airline because schedule but they said I can only choose same airline. What the..And they said if there is no schedule for same airline just buy new ticket.It is so unfair. I didn't force full refund. I understand it so I told them I will buy another ticket so just take cancel fee and give me sky picker point so that I can buy new flight but they said just buy new one or change same airline.I also asked give me list of ticket that I can change and how much should I pay but already passed 24hours but no reply.
4	Great customer service from Markéta after I made a mistake booking and needed to check some baggage details. Got back an email with everything resolved and every tiny detail I needed quickly and painlessly.Thanks!
5	I used Kiwi and booked a ticket from the USA to India. There was a hurricane in one of my Layovers and my flight got canceled, but Kiwi representatives were there to help me. I got amazing service.

5	Going from ZAGREB to DUBLIN with kids and wife went perfectly-we felt secure and had a feeling of security with Skypicker all the way, although we were relocating with kids. Skypicker values your time and do everything quickly and professionally. If you're traveling, try Skypicker, you won't end up queuing in a wrong gate or missing a plane, allocating seats etc...Thanks Skypicker,Vibor
1	Took forever to change flight even though I reported the change within minutes of buying the ticket. Had to spend so much time chatting, calling and emailing to get them to change it. Every person told me that they would get back to me within a certain time but never did. Hours turned into days without any word. In the end, they were going to charge me a change fee when if they did it when I asked them to it would have been for free. I know because they did it for a traveling companion for free.  This was definitely not a good experience.
5	Today Miroslava helped me very well with my question about check-in options and with the booking of additional baggage for my flight. The other consultants I contacted in the past worked well too. Good Job, Kiwi.com-Team ;)
5	They are meant for big! Fast, efficient, polite and solve all your problem.
5	I wanted to add extra luggage and <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> helped me very well with everything! (i forgot the name of the woman who helped me : s)
4	i got help from Lenka, she was very good and helped me. This is good services!
5	Skypicker can help you with everything 24/7 even if you have bought ticket from some budget company,I had a lot of questions about my flights and staff of skypicker (Kostya)helped me with it.I definitely will recommend use skypicker to my friends, thanks.
5	I contacted your customer service through the online chat and got immediate help from Radim K. He was very helpful and quick in answering me and fixed the problem I had within no time! Thank you very much for the great assistance you provided!Amandine
5	Radim was the travel consultant for me today. He was nice, quick to reply and efficient in cancelling my booking and giving me a full refund. great customer service!
5	I can fully recomended booking trip with kiwi. I have some additional request to get my boarding card ealier and I had recieved great support from Monika and her colligues (Krystina and Jan). Best customer service that you can get!
4	Polite people
5	There were some problems with my booking and I have received an e-mail that it had delayed being processed I was concerned because the prices of the flight had been changing rapidly. I wrote to the support asking wether my booking was successful. The reply was positive but also Margarita gave me some useful information about my flight.
5	Using the live-chat for trouble-shooting was a pleasant experience. The nice lady taking care of our problem (missing boarding-passes for tomorrows flight), ms Katerina G., quickly identified the problem, and provided us with the necessary instructions.   T.K, Warsaw, Poland
5	Miroslav, was my chat-agent this time and he really answered chick to my questions and was really polite and professional! Thank you!
5	Natali is Great! ;)
5	I could not access my booking first but once I asked for help the response solved the issue within minutes
5	Quick and efficient! I had a question about my booking, I used the chat service and the problem was solved within minutes.
1	Booking a flight, the booking was cancelled because my husband paid on his Credit card, i called Kiwi straight away and was told that i can go through extra security to process the payment but this takes 24 hours so i should bother! i wont be using again. Very unhelpful
5	Daniel Peter deserves his bonus
5	I got great service from everyone at skypicker, especially from Martin Carter and Mary p.  They were very helpful, exceptionally knowledgeable, and friendly.  I highly recommend this sit for your flights and vacation bookings.  L. M. Toronto
5	Easy website and the live chat box was very helpful. Thank you, Alan, for helping me out with the check in process!
5	I had a problem during the reservation. I didn´t know how to fill some fields. I contacted the customer service live chat. My supporter Jiří Červenka was very polite and he helped me to solve my problem. Thank you very much.
4	I was having a problem booking the flight for my friends due to credit card security reasons. Lucie F. in live chat gave me excellent help. Thank you for your excellent effort Lucie F.
5	Hello...Kiwi is great,but greater is the operator Lucia,who was very nice an kind and helped me with my first flight  ;) issues...Keep up the good work
4	"I used <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> for the first time, and it was proper :- The flight was successfully booked- There wasn't any hidden additional fee- The 23 Kg luggage was included- The price was 30% less than on the company websiteDon't believe the mail they send to you which state that you can't have your ticket number or web check in. Don't wait for <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>'s help, but just go by yourself with ""Amadeus"" and also find the airline check in company link. I even choose my seat for free."
5	I couldn't send my check-in information via the website, so I contacted customer support via chat. Lenka was very attentive, responsive, and overall nice. Thanks again for the help!
5	Easy to use and they take care of everything. Had no issues at all and would definitely recommend. The only thing I wish was that they updated their system to allow getting Ryanair tickets with the app.And their guarantee if we miss a flight because of delays definitely helped ease my mind of worries!
5	Everything was amazing. I've booked a flight for the wrong date and Renata managed to change it to the correct one. Really helpful! Thank you!
5	Fast, convenient, quickly. I book for the first time on this site, but I really liked it. Now all tickets are only on this site
5	Everything went smooth and without any problems. Very helpful customer service even by using facebook.
5	Thanks Victor!!!  Great service!
5	She was very helpful in cancelling some flights and applying for a credit
3	dont worry if ever u block me i will keep wreting  to u  bc u are steeler yes  this is the truth u steel 800 ero from me and u refuse to change the flight or even gave us our money back
4	live chat always support me with out wait timeLilia K great help me even not native English languages thanks
4	@skypickercom Ah okay. I didn't pay for the ticket so didn't notice :). Why include it, just seems confusing? CC's are not to be joked with.
5	I have used a lot of services like Skypicker because I am a regular flyer from Australia back to my condo in Bangkok, my recent visit home to my condo I was searching for a long time for the best deal and price ( because I am a regular flyer I always try to find the cheapest deals) and I finally found the best deals after many hours of searching, their prices were very good and service was outstanding so I recommend Skypicker to everyone.
1	Had a two hour layover in Mexico City, due to slow moving customs and absent transport to the other terminal, I missed the next connection. Kiwi did not help me at all. They did not reimburse the flights i missed, nor did they buy me a new flight. I was left on my own. I had another flight a week later which was going to become obsolete due to this mishap. When I enquired about refunding this, $200 flight, I was told that they could get $30 back from the airline and after they took their $20 cancellation fee, that would leave me with $10. Can you imagine? After all that, losing $500 worth of flights, them not helping with that at all, they still want to charge me a $20 cancellation fee for another flight. Thieves. Nothing more. I spoke with customs in Mexico city, customs generally takes .5 - 2 hours. Checkin closes ~45mins before, and time between terminals is 20min. Therefore Kiwi should not be selling flights with only a 2 hour layover. To be safe, 3 should be the minimum.They didn't update their policy or system as far as I am aware.
5	I booked several flights with Skypicker and received regular email communications on flight status.Excellent value for money service.
5	Live chat is better than a phone call, instant and efficient.
5	My connecting flight was cancelled and the alternative offered by the airline was not optimal.  i used the chat feature and within minutes i had a representative looking into my options and booked on another flight that was more inline with my original booking.Thank you Viktor, you were a great help.
4	We needed help with a misspelled name, and Valery helped us fix it on the Live Chat feature. Now we hope the airline will be as quick as Valery was.
2	A startup that finds discount flight tickets 'hidden' on airline websites has  launched <https://t.co/BfUb6f6QGy> <https://t.co/765Merl2zX>
5	I have to say I love this company so far! Their customer service has been quick and reliable. I am really impressed. Tomas K topped it off by finding something I had overpaid for and issued a refund automatically with a nice apology email!
1	First and last time use a skypicker.  Bad communication...live chat- wiith auto answer its doesnt called live. Email i found only from where was send tickets. By phone i already read that no reason to call- how to solve your problem nobody answers you there.On my mail was answeredThank you for your e-mail. Indeed I can see you were on the chat about three days ago but you disconnected and did not answer our agent.--- i leave because waiting more than hour timeWe are a non refundable and non cancellable company and you have agreed to our Terms and Conditions while buying the ticket. Unfortunately now it is too late to try to change the tickets to another date as we have a 48 hours before departure policy and passed that time we cannot change bookings. I am very sorry but we have also 6 different phone numbers on your e-ticket, including the helpline in Czech.---great so 3 days ago i was in chat and cannot communicate, because in live chat only i was alive, but  Romain Rouchet hint me thats its my fault...i didnt wait....6 different numbers---sorry see only 1 everywhere, and its more waste money than helps....probably thats why you cannot find info mail anywhere .We remain available 24/7 for any further question or request.With kind regards,Romain RouchetCannot say thanks for helping---no help, if something happends. Well at least thanks for answering in result, when was to late for me to do something.
5	The support of Eric from <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>, was really fast and helpful. Also he was really friendly and had a lot of patience. :)Tanks a lot.
4	We had a canceled flight and the support contacted us very quickly to offer a alternate flight. No troubles at all.
1	Cheater and liar!! I certainly do not recommend.!
5	very fast very nice and very efficient  thanks to dorota helped me with booking problems sloved in a matter of seconds , thanks again kiwi
5	Thanks for your feedback and amazing service. Very fast responses. Big Thank you for Lucia.
3	The day before my flight, I missed the 72h time limit for check-in and I had to be charged 90 euros if I couldn't check in. I requested the offer to online counselling service. Fortunately the traveling counsellor Puput helped the flight to be done so I can go to the airport without worry now. Even though 72 hours of given time were too short unreasonably, I'm really thankful to him.
5	I just called for some help to know how everything works before flying, I was attended by Susana and the service was simply excellent :) Still haven't flown but everything perfect so far.
5	"I had a simple question about the document number and thought ""I'll give the chat a try"" and there he was, Emre T. He answered the question in like 3 seconds or less and he was really kind and understanding. He offered to fill the document number for me and really took time to hear what I had to say. I think Emre T. is an awsome guy that really want to help people and he want to the customer to understand.Thanks Emre T. for guiding me through the processs. I appriciate your help!Kind regardsCarl"
5	My first flight reserved via Skypicker has been cancelled which had for consequence the missing of the second one. So, I contacted the Skypicker team for a solution. They immediatly transfert me on anorher flight.The are really reactive and helpfull.
4	Cheapest flights I found. However they have a few problems with searching the right airports in german at least.
5	One of the best customer service experience I have encountered, if not the best. Sofia Kallas is very helpful ! Keep up the great work!
5	Muchas gracias Rodon por resolver el problema de manera rapida y eficaz, me he ahorrado el atraco de 70 euros de impresion de billete de Ryanair.
5	I had to cancel my flights due to some reason and spoke to Katerina at <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>. She handled all my queries exceedingly well and went out of her way to help me with the cancellation and ensured that I was able to get a good refund from the airline. All in all it was a great experience talking to Katerina and <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> team and I would definitely purchase ticket on their platform again.
5	Perfect and easy. Thanks for your help Alan W. Better late than never.
5	I made a mistake on my end and did not enter in my email address properly, after a brief conversation through Kiwi's chat space for online help with Eva O., my email address was corrected and I had no problems whatsoever! Thank you, Eva O.!! You're a superstar! ^~^
4	Great online support , faced few issues initially but  all issues were sorted immediately and definitely the tickets are  way cheaper than any other travel site ! Highly recommend to those travellers who are sure about their destinations well in advance .
4	Eleonora helped with with all my queries regarding my flight booking and also tried to clear the doubts I had.Jonathan helped me with sorting out the changes that I had to do in my booking. He also coordinated with the Airlines for the same and kept me updated.Excellent work. Keep it up.Cheers!!!!!
5	Hi, I had some questions related to check-in baggage. I was patient enough to wait in my queue to be answered by customer care representative. I was welcomed by greeting and preliminary questions were asked by Lenka. Once she understood my query, she was prompt enough to guide me on how to check the baggage details and cost associated. She then went over and beyond and informed me that she can give me the best rates after talking to airlines directly which might take some time and she will share information over email. With 5 minutes after closing our conversation, I got an email from Lenka with the best deal that I can get from airlines. I truly appreciate support provided by Lenka in my query resolution.
5	Just chatted with Natali in customer services and she was very helpful with the problem I had. She was also very friendly and quickly solved my issue :)
5	"I hate the hoops you need to jump through to fly these days. I found booking my flights through Skypicker to be very easy, in spite of taking a complex route by my standards.I wasn't sure how to check in for my flights, so I clicked the ""Online help"" button on the site.After a few basic information gathering questions from a computer, I was put through to a text conversation with Tomas who made the whole experience very easy.I feel extremely relaxed now, with Skypicker doing a lot of the heavy lifting for me, Tomas in particular."
5	Had an issue on a booking with Kiwi (I forgot to put some info), tried the chat, and was really nicely welcomed by Denis, who took care of the issue I had in no time. That is some nice support.
5	Filip is a very nice supporter. He helped me with my question. A kind and good person. Keep it so!!!
1	"I am very worried about my bookingWhen I was booking the reservation yesterday, my booking schedule was wrong, so when I received e-mail for the booking confirmation ( the booking status is  just being processed)I requested to hold my booking immediately but my opinion was ignored they sent the E-ticket and informed the booking is confirmationI contacted to the service center to know whether this problem is the technical error or not.the service center worker said let you know why this problem occurs and don't worried about the cost you paidI am waiting for 2 days.But they don't send any reply before I try to contact them(they just told me "" please be patience "")If my problem is not due to the technical system, I need to pay more for my change booking. I've never experienced anything this insane"
5	Skypicker presented me one of the cheapest flight and I had no trouble while booking. Since the booking confirmation did not arrive right away I got an email, that there were booking problems with one airline. I appreciate very much that I was informed about the delay, including some information about the delay instead of not receiving any information at all (which is quite common amongst other booking companies). Pretty customer friendly.
5	Used Skypicker to book round trip air from Dublin to Edinburgh.  Due mostly to my lack of understanding, a luggage issue was created.  Information listed on carrier's website indicated complete incompatibility with USA/International regulations regarding size and weigh of luggage. Martin Carter was on live chat with me for over an hour working the issue and basically resolved the problem pending agreement with the carrier. Today Alaa received response from carrier and worked the issue to a positive conclusion.  In this case, I could not have expected a more professional approach and completeness.  I have nothing but good things to say about these two employees.  Thanks Keith
5	Kristina Blahova (my customer service rep) was the most patient person I have ever encountered in this sort of business. She looked up information for me to add a checked luggage to my upcoming flight and emailed me a direct link to pay for it. She looked up how much it would cost me to chose my seat on my upcoming flight with the airline. she was always so warm and friendly. I know that it sounds strange because we are behind a computer chating but she made that experience so much better than it usually is. She asked constantly if she could help with anything else. She did not lose interest and become inpatient to close the chat ever. I felt like she really cared to make me feel comfortable and take some of the stress away from me that comes with traveling and planning a vacation. I believe that customer service is the most important thing a company should focus on in order to keep customers coming back and my experience has been so positive thus far that I will definitely continue to use Kiwi for future bookings.

5	Cheap flights, easy booking - and excellent service. I had some issues with my bookings, and Ulugbek and Martin at <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> solved them to my utmost satisfaction. Highly recommended.
5	I recently booked with Skypicker at a great price. I also experienced their customer service because I had marked my wife as MR. by mistake. The issue was resolved very quickly by Eva Sloukova for my peace of mind. Greatly Recommended !
1	Don't deal with them. They are scammers. You will lose your money
5	I would highly recommend Skypicker. Our flights with Ryanair were cancelled for our return home; Ryanair's staff were extremely unhelpful. Skypicker's affable and well-trained staff ensured that what was a stressful situation for us was well-managed. They also provided documentation (needed as evidence for university) that our flight was cancelled extremely quickly after my request.Furthermore, the best deal I could find online initially was with Skypicker. This, together with superb customer service from the 4/5 different workers I spoke too, ensures I will recommend Skypicker to my friends and family.
5	My flight was delayed due to an air show conducted in Morocco with no advanced notice to the crew. We were stuck on board for an hour and a half. Due to this delay I was late to my connecting flight. I was scheduled for work the next day so was panicking. Thankfully I contacted the live chat and Monika Fabryova was able to assist me and walk me through each step. She was able to get me the next flight out at no charge and was patient with me during the whole process. Thank you again to her and he team for getting my flight situated. Missing a connecting flight is never fun and being stuck somewhere you don't anticipate to be can be overwhelming. Thanks again.
4	This is very simplified low cost service. I'm satisfied with it.
5	Perfect by all means - online checking via online help? i thought it woundt be possible but how i was surprised by the help!!
5	I had given the wrong nationality for my travel companion and Tereza P. has solved my problem very quickly and gave sufficient explanation to what I am to do afterwards, nothing! Good service
5	best service, good job
5	Tomas just helped me with my problem and he was really fast and helpful ! Thank you !
5	I dealt with Julia from the customer support team regarding some questions I had with a booking. She was very polite and gave me all the information I need and advised there would be a follow up to confirm everything with me. There were no delays and I was responded to immediately. Thanks for the help!
5	We had a great experience so far with quite a few plane tickets we booked via Skypicker. One small glitch we had with the issuing of a boarding pass was promptly solved 20 minutes after we sent an e-mail by travel consultant Pavel Fridrich, to whom we are grateful.
5	My experience with the chat support was perfect - Irene changed passport details (as I got my new passport issued just recently) in no time or hassle.
5	Just booked my flights for Christmas and received excellent customer service via live chat. Thank you Enri A. for fixing my problems, and merry Christmas, if it's not too early for that! :P
5	Eric from <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> was helpful. He answered all my queries and clarified with responses to my worrying questions. I hope that my extra baggage order is processed sooon for my journey, and fingers crossed I don't get into any trouble with airlines. Thank you Eric
5	Anna was a great help in helping me with seat selections. The next time I fly international I will definitely use skypicker.
5	Would like to thank puput for helping me sort out a couple of issues, we had with our flights. Very helpful and response was very quick.
4	Easy. Best price. Good service.
5	What a great service,  Eric helped me to solve my problem quickly . It's nice to get helpful customer service; people kind ,willing to help .. ! Thank you
4	I had some great help clearing up some questions I had about luggage, talking with the customer service representative Adrian. the representative was very helpful and polite and seemed very honest and upfront with me. The experience buying tickets themselves was good, not great, and there wasn't a lot of transparency. It was not obvious from the booking how to purchase carry on luggage, as there was no option with only the capability of purchasing checked luggage. Adrian helped clear some of this up but I am only now to find I have to make four separate purchases for carry on luggage for 2 passengers on 2 connecting flights under the same reservation. I hope the trip goes well. Overall, very pleased with the support I received, though the booking has left me with misgivings
5	awesome service! Thank you Samuel for awesome and fast service!
5	Excellent customer service received from Igor. Had a problem with my booking and he solved it in 2 minutes, thank you very much! KIWI helpdesk is the BEST!
4	The overall everything is great just sometimes difference between prices in map or those with picture. And I like that all is easy and clear and I hope safe also.
5	Excelente servicio, buenos precios y la atención telefónica inmejorable.Muchisimas gracias, Carlo Bernardis, por tu ayuda. Eres un gran profesional.Estamos MUY contentos con vuestro servicio. Carlo se ha tomado la molestia de llamarnos personalmente y de cambiar todos los asientos al pasillo. Muchas muchas gracias.
5	CompetitiveUncomplicatedTrustfulKIWI is making things Clear.
5	I thought my booking was a scam. Almost 1 month of waiting for my e-ticket update. But thanks Enri A. for the immediate response and good service she provided. Problems solved and I'm now worry free.:)
5	Thank you so much, Alan Whitfield, for taking the time and effort to find the answer to my query regarding rechecking-in and all. You are all very helpful and polite indeed.
5	Quick answers and wonderful service by Ivana V. Thank u so much. Recommended.
1	"Changing flights will cost you more than ""the difference and fees"" BEWAREVery disappointed. My son booked a flight from Montreal to Frankfurt and return for $953 USD on Lufthansa. He then asked Kiwi to change the itinerary to go to Valencia, Spain a few days earlier. They took over 12 hours to get back to him by email (the website says within 4 hrs). They offered him 2 choices, one on a low price carrier with longer layovers and one on Lufthansa. Great! Except the price for the change was MORE THAN THE ORIGINAL TICKET!! $1050 USD!! NO refund or credit for the flight he wasn't using from Montreal to Frankfurt. Just another full fare ticket from their website listings. Come on! You are a discount carrier. When I researched options on their website I found lots of other choices for less $$, including a seat for $600 on Air France with a reasonable layover, but by then it was too late. My son had paid for the change feeling a sense of urgency about not finding a ticket to Valencia at all since he had only been offered the 2 options after waiting overnight for a reply email from Kiwi. He also thought, wrongly, that there would be a refund for the Montreal to Franfurt flight he was no longer using. But no! Kiwi manager claimed that this is what Lufthansa was charging them. Well, if you don't have good relations with the airlines, get out of the discount travel business! I will never have my kids, nor will I or my husband, or our friends, use this discount site. And my recommendation to anyone reading this: Use an American based discount travel website like travelocity, hotwire, kayak expedia, orbitz, or find discounts thru the Airlines that charge a fixed $200 to make a change in a leg of the trip."
5	Great customer service and even better if you can chat in your own language.Thanks Martin Carter for your kind & helpful service.
5	Amazing costumer service. Responds quickly to queries and issues I had.
3	New App Skypicker Will Find You the Cheapest International Flight <https://t.co/mJ6vKOreyz>
4	I had an issue with my ticket and had to cancel it , Vika helped through the process of cancellation and answered all of my questions promptly. I was very pleased with the service.
5	Natalya P was great and got me a refund for my cancelled flight! Thanks very much!
5	I had such a prompt and helpful chat with Erin. I also got such an amazing price from Vegas to Australia for 650 bucks, I'm still in shock. Thank you so much for reviewing my ticket details and putting my mind at ease Erin.
2	Worst online flight booking experience ever! I am very disappointed Skypicker. You have a lot of potential!One staff member, Ivana, has saved this from being a 1 star review. I hope never to have to book on this service again. I had to use it as I am booking a flight for my elderly ill father from Indonesia, for him to fly from Australia to Sri Lanka. I spent a fortune of my own money trying to communicate with them. I sent about 5 or 6 chats in a 5 hour period asking at first politely, for someone to call me as the internet where I was, was unrealiable. Not only did nobody call me but one person insisted on addressing the Mistakes and issues can occur in these situations so I can't blame anyone for errors/misunderstandings- it was the communication that was a nightmare. It was simple- I said I don't trust the internet communication where I was, and requested that somebody call me. I eventually got a reluctant call back, was informed somebody would call back in 10 minutes to answer my query, and nobody did. I subsequently (over an hour later) made a number of attempts to live chat and also asked somebody to call me from the live chat. Ignored. I also emailed and nobody responded to my email. The only decent employee I spoke to was Ivana and that is when I insisted more than once on speaking to her . After a number of calls and a lot of effort on my part, they got what I was saying!! I felt like it was an absolute battle to communicate, and a couple of them were plain rude. As in ZERO customer service. I think they were actually trying hard but nobody communicated what was going on to me?! And I felt like there was constant defensiveness when all I was saying was 'can somebody pls speak to me over the phone as the internet is unreliable where i was'. I made it clear I was available by email and phone. Whole process eventually took about 6 hours!
5	excellent service
5	I was pleased to book with kiwi. I accidentally typed my email address wrong so I didn't got my boarding passes but the client service fixed everything super fast and friendly. Big thank-you to travel consultant Arsen who managed everything pretty fast for me.Next time I am going to book at kiwi again!
5	I have a connecting flight. My first flight was delayed for 1 hr. Kiwi agents helped me get an alternative flight. When they figured out that it would be less cumbersome for me to buy the ticket at the airport, they promised me that they will refund the cost. They waited until I get the ticket and ensure that I passed the immigration. They also talked to me like talking to a normal human being and not a robot. That's a big plus to me. Thank you very much <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>. Thank you, Bernard & Anasstasia. You two are awesome.
5	I want to say níce job to the costumer  care attendant  name VIKA thanks for your assistance  and I can't  wait to buy my next trip ticket from you kiwi.
5	Neil absolutely smashed our online chat out of the park, he was super quick and responsive, went above and beyond the call of duty by checking me in to my flight for me and provided me with some extra useful information. Absolutely smashed it, cheers Neil!
5	I have found a very cheap flight using this agency. When I encountered a problem, I used the live chat and Enri A. was very helpful and resolved the issue in a very short time.
4	I had two agents looking after my inquiries and were very prompt and efficient ! Not only did I get emails but also phone calls to make sure I got a reply. Excellent customer service and very kind staff.
5	Resolving flight issues with a budget airline booked throughj <http://KIWI.com|KIWI.com>.  Budget airlines have lots of little complications like checked baggage gotchas no luggage transfer, etc....  It isn't the fault of KIWI, but they are often at the frontline resolving these gotchas.So glad I booked through <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> rather than another ticketing agency.  MONIKA K was absolutely phenomenal with the text chat customer support. We were able to resolve the situation, add payment, all through their manage booking interface.  No jumping from system to system or link to link!What a nice breath of fresh air.  KIWI systems and processes are well done!
5	This is my first time booking flights through <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com>, I had never heard about this company before and was a little apprehensive about departing my money on an unknown site. So today I decided to give them a call with a few questions about my trip and layovers. The call waiting time was so long about 45 mins to answer a call which then made me doubt this company's authenticity however after a distressingly eager wait my call was finally answered by a lovely gentleman named Eric. He was so helpful and genuine - answered all my questions and also searched up other questions based on visa requirements even though it wasn't part of his job description. I'm greatful at the level of costumer service that I have been provided with and felt the need to write a review.
5	Very quick response.
5	I had some problems with overweight. The customer service (Jan J.) went above and beyond to solve my problems and really helped me out. Could not be happier and never experienced such an excellent customer service before! Thank you very much :)
5	This is the only site for me now.......Thanks.....
5	Great service, Thank you Anas Dallal for all your help. you were a tremendous  help. I will definatly be using you again especially if all the agents are as helpful as Anas,
5	Now we're talking! Awesome, thanks a lot for your assistance :)
5	I want to thank online assistant Jana, who helped me to solve some additional luggage issues and was absolute helpful and sweet. It was a pleasure to see such a customer care and the level of communication was great. Thank you!Will consider using them for every flight I book!
5	Friedly, kind and very competent service.
5	Quick, Fast and easy. I recommend!My agent was Jakob Thanks again!
5	I would like to say thank you so much Michaela who assisted me on live chat just about now. I had a lot of questions and she was really really kind and professional, I'm still waiting for the response that needs time to be confirmed, but only the assistence was great, and it is a pleasure to use your services! Best Regards, Joana.
5	Lot of thanks to Anna T. via Live Chat! Fast and professional, a breath of fresh air with all the problems regarding Brussels Airport changes. Till next time, skypicker ;-)
4	the service was really good! thanks to radek for helping me out!
5	At first, I was hesitant to book through <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> since I hadn't heard of it before and saw some across the board reviews. Before I bought my tickets, I got in touch with Customer Service and Lukas answered all my questions promptly and efficiently. I booked the flight immediately after because I felt comfortable that everything was legitimate and I wasn't going to get taken advantage of. My trip is a few months away so I'll be sure to post if everything goes smoothly with the bookings afterwards. Thanks Lukas for the help and <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> for the great deal!
5	i am pleased of the support given by Emre T. 5 stars ;)
4	Skypicker is simple, intuitive and fast system for cheap flyghts. We were satisfied with their services :)
5	Today I mistakenly booked air ticket for July 31st instead August 31st through Kivi. After 20 minutes I informed Kivi about my mistake. During one hour Kivi team did a very intensive job and I received an updated air ticket. Everything was done on perfect professional level. A special thanks to Peter and Yuriy V. Good job guys!
1	Used kiwi to book a ticked because they offerd the option to book extra luguage at the same time even though the price was 200,- euro more then somewhere els.A week later they send me a email that extra luguage cannot be booked and i have to arrange this myselve at the airport during the transfer between flights.After confronting customer support and explaining that i only used kiwi because of the extra luguage option and expressing the feeling that i somehow gor robbed of 200,- i would like a solution for this i got told that kiwi is not responsible for airline terms and conditions and i should be happy with the offerd refund of the cost for the luguage at the airport.Unacceptable! If you make a mistake, try to find a solution that is working for both partys and dont send a 5 line email with something that works only for you!
4	Reserving my flight was very easy and the automatic online checkin worked very efficient. Every step they took regarding the process was reported to me by email making me feel safer about the transaction. I didn't need to contact them directly so I have no opinion on that matter.
5	Kira, was so helpful today, booked a flight today and made a mistake with my email address but Kira contacted me   immediately  and she was able to correct it.. Thanks Kira keep up the good work.:+1::skin-tone-4:
5	lidya b assist me with heart, she is very kind :) love it
5	Contacted the <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> for a tricky request, for adding a baggage for a part of the journey. Eric was very patient, friendly and helpful in getting the request processed. Excellent job!
5	The service i received by Lukas Kouril was outstanding. I am suffering from Cancer and need to get back to hospital for treatment, I made a reservation for feb 13 and ment it to be March 13th. Called Lucas an was very surprised he handled it no problem Cheers to you people Ill book my next 4 trips before end on March with you guys thanks to Lucas
4	Had a very easy time booking my flights through kiwi, but received some conflicting emails with regards to flight changes. When I called in the day of the clarify, Natalia and Dalek were both very helpful in making sure that my flights were booked properly and even booked me an extra flight to make sure that I didn't have to stress about a very tight connection.
4	My flight to Milan from Gatwick got cancelled on account of the weather. Zdenka from <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> was helpful in getting alternative flight options to catch my connecting flights and she was available on the phone during both days. Eventual alternative flight not ideal as it left from Luton at 6:45 am (no trains at that time) but kiwi guarantee covers the additional transport costs. Good work from kiwi and Zdenka on getting the alternative fligihts though.
5	Got help adding baggage to my flights post booking, and they made it easy.
5	i like this company because its secure and easy to book your booking flight , and have a good support and instantly answerThank you so mush Skypicker
5	I need to say that this morning I had an amazing experience with your customer service - namely Monika K.! She arranged everything quickly, precisely and she was very polite. I really appreciated her approach and guidance. Big THANK YOU!Adriana(P.S. Dear Monika I wanted to apologize at the end of our conversation my browser froze so I couldn't thank you properly! Thank you very much for your help! :)

5	Simply great service! Good attitude, and fantasize Semitic patience! I am so grateful to Jan and Michal who have arranged up there! a heart for you!// Gabriel
5	Samael and IgorI booked a collection of flights through this company, however had a few problems regarding checked luggage closer to the date of the first flight. Thankfully, a few members of the help center were able to accommodate the luggage, and now the trip is covered! I would definitely recommend this company for organizing a trip. Thanks again Samael & Igor!
5	My experience emailing with Skypicker was surprisingly great. I say surprisingly because when you email a customer service address, you do not expect to receive a response, let alone a response within 60 minutes. Thank you Skypicker for being awesome and human in your customer service communication!

5	I bought my ticket on kiwi and it gives everytime excellent deals and cheap price and in advance I recommend all other guys thank you they have helpful great live chat services that answer all your question with perfect satisfaction tank you irina for your help
5	I recently contacted Skypicker to cancel a flight, I figured I would just be eating the cost and would be dealing with the typical automated system, to my pleasant surprise, I was connected to a real person,  Pavel. He was incredibly helpful and informative. He made my experience *gasp* enjoyable. I will be using skypicker again just for its amazing customer service. Thank you Pavel for not only making my day, but making my whole week!!!!!
4	While I was tired to look for a booking site where can I book my Indian Domestic flight I got skypicker. No one local indian site accepted my credit card and then I made it through skypicker. The price is same as local Indian booking site so it was like water in the dessert while I was in tough situations.
5	I got this great guy named Tom to chat with me.He actually answered kindly to all my dumbest questions. Great job Tom keep it up!
5	Everything was perfect, consultant Sabina was very helpful and patient to explain me everything. Thank you
4	had a slight issue with the online passport input form got an agent named Pavel and he sorted out the problem in no time
5	I had to make changes to my itinerary and Irina Selezneva from Skypicker helped me that same day. Thank you!
1	Book a flight on saturday received Tickets for the same flight on monday 2 days later. The interesting thing is that the flight on monday i got is much cheaper at the Airline itself i am flying with. After 3 hours of telephoning and waiting i decided to book the flight at the Airline directly because the cost for changing was the same. And i am 100 percent sure that it was Sa the 20.08.16 and Not Mo 22.08.16 on the booking formular and i was not booking alone. Badest idea to book here. This is ridiculous.
5	THANK YOU very much to Patrik for your patience in answering all my many questions !!!Extremely efficient and commendable service ...Thank you!
4	I am going to fly to Scotland and back within 10 days. So far, i have experienced a very good service regarding questions and solving them immediately. Therefore two wonderful people helped me. The first one was Petr Kuncl and the second one was Olga Colenova. I also hope to be as happy with their service after my trip. I definitely let you know...
5	We needed some information regarding our booking with Ryanair for additional baggage. Phana from Skypicker helped us a lot with additional information and was very patient, thanks a lot Phana :-)
5	A lot of the staff has been very helpfull and speciel Sillorm has done a great job. Thank you!
1	I booked a flight through <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> for £34, obviously very happy with the cost as much cheaper than anywhere else but then after blaming minor technical details and a few emails sent with late reply it turns out this flight can no longer be booked so offered refund..Now I should know better but I see a flight on a different day through <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> at £34.86. Again much cheaper than elsewhere so i booked again.. anyway the usual minor technical details arise and I kind of knew what was coming, alas no flight for this amount but I can book it if I stump up another £23.14. I declined so another refund on the way what I've been informed might take up to 10 days..what a waste of time. Now I look for another flight and too my suprise (not really) <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> are still offereing the same flight for £34 ..This price for this flight does not exist but there quick to take your moneyThere blame some 3rd party and the usual crap but they should not be advertising flights in which there is no way they can honour the quoted price..False advertisementDraw your own conclusions as to why they do this..there's another company on scam advisor who do the exact same thing and been warned not to use themI'm still awaiting a reply to the last email sent to them
5	Excellent customer service, they solved my problem very fast through their chat :)
5	I am extremely pleased with the wonderful customer service of <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>.First of all they are 24/7 reachable. Second of all, they are fast, polite and to the point. Jaime provided excellent phone support and fixed my issue quickly. His college Christine had already chatted with me and the great thing was that Jaime knew about the conversation I had with his collegue.Thank you Kiwi for your efficient help.
5	great thank's to Serhii. Thanks for the service.
2	I purchased 2 tickets for Milan in January the price of 480 lei and what seemed curious that in the coming days to date ticket prices are half the price now paid by me. How is it possible, just the day I bought the tickets I have a price so high?
5	I wanted to change my flight date, but because it was part of connecting flight I couldn't do it myself. The live chat option you offer is very convinient and I was able to get help as soon as I opened the window. My helper was Emre T and he/she was very helpful and polite through the whole way and let me know when I had to wait a bit longer. So all thanks to him and Skypicker. I am more than happy to use you again when booking flights. Based on my experience, I couldn't have gotten any better customer service from Air Asia directly.
4	I've had a mix of customer service from kiwi. I had an issue with time concerning the costing of changing a name of a passenger, and found myself chasing up on a lack of response, and kept being told I would have to wait longer. Moreover, once I had sorted this, there was a typo in the name change which caused more hassle. However, I have had a few kiwi agents that have been particularly helpful, especially Valentin and Marketa, who really helped to move things along and sort out problems.
5	Ms.Alexandra helped me a lot in settle the credit card verification online and cancelled the booking that I have done. All the information are given to me clearly and she answered all my questions.Thank you so much, Ms.Alexandra.
5	Had a few questions about my mail about our tickets and he checked and told me why so I got the answer I needed and very nice :)
5	@kiwicom247 Actually, they can be booked directly with the provider - Directflight. But it's a pain. Nevermind, just a thought. :-)
4	Hello, my name is Nick and I was in a very unpleasant situation.I had a transfer from Dubai to Kuala Lumpur and then Sydney. I missed my flight to Kuala Lumpur, because I didn't have enough time to get to a different terminal.I was told to buy another ticket to Kuala Lumpur for 200-300 dollars, but all I had was 100 Euro. Plus I have to get there before my flight to Sydney.So, I called Skypicker, explained them my situation and hoped for the best.I was in Dubai for 7 hours, waiting for good news and here they come:Skypicker solved all my problems for free and gave me the chance to visit Qatar for a few hours :)My big thank you to Mr.Emre Tam and his supervisor Leonardo plus all staff, which worked with them this day.I really recommend Skypicker, because in my situation different companies wouldn't help, they would say it was my problem, so I have to pay everything myself, because thats the rules!
1	"One of my worst experiences with travel websites. I booked a flight from kuala lumpur to Muscat with a stop in India by <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> , after the booking was done I discovered that I needed a visa for India to get out of the transit section and get my other boarding pass to muscat so I cancelled the ticket before 14 days of the flight to get a refund. After canceling I was promised to get my refund in 14 days and now it has been 2 months STILL NO REFUND.Every two weeks I contact Kiwi coustomer service they say I have to wait while they check with the airlines and their supervisor to check what's going on , and I never get an answer back neither by e-mail or phone . Before one month I contacted them to check what's going on and they gave me the same answer that I have to wait for 30 days. So I waited and called today and still the same answer "" we have to contact the airline and check with the supervisor "" this is really frustrating. Worst experience ever."
5	When people like Pedro and Lukas are on the other side of the computer/telephone, there is nothing to worrie... your problems will be solved!
5	very good service, perfect with the chat
5	Thank you Eric, now we are waiting for the aproval to take our surfboard with us.
5	I used a couple of comparision sites to compare recent flights and Skypicker's came out the cheapest. It was with Easy Jet and the whole booking process was pretty seemless. If someone asked if I trusted Skypicker, I would have no reservations in recommending them.
4	Good and easy to use service:)
5	I am currently living in the USA, Received a call and I was not able to take the call, however they left a voice mail which i love it !! I wasn't able to call back but i found out the chatlive and it was just GREAT!! Babak took care of me and the service was amazing thanks so much!! totally recommend working with them!!

1	Publié il y a 1 secondesVery disappointing and end up costing and extra ticketWe bought 2 seats full price but made a mistake on the passenger year of birth making it appears like an infant. However we paid for two adults tickets we should be given two seats. No problem on the ongoing flight. On the return flight, Skypicker paid the airline for one seat, so the airline would not let us both check-in. We missed our flight since there was no other seat available. Asking skypicker to buy the second seat, the one they owed us, for a later flight, they never accepted and neither wanted to reimburse.

5	The Kiwi crew helped me changed the flight details after i had booked mt flat. What i thought was going to be a complicated matter turned out to be a step by step guidance to create a flight that I truly required.I spoke to a guy called Bodgan who was jovial and performed his work as though i was the only customer he had to deal withImpressedJustin
5	I had accidentally booked flights at 7 o'clock in the morning, when I thought it was in the evening. I contacted Customer Services at <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> and spoke to Jakub. He couldn't be more helpful, and gave me lots of options with changing the flights. Once he'd heard back, we only had 10 minutes to make the decision and confirm, and in the final minute he managed to complete the transfer. Extremely happy and very satisfied with the customer service I received from Jakub Pesa. Thanks again!
5	Thank you so much for the chat service. I am writing form Peru and had a lot of questions about my flight. Luckily, I receive the support of Josef from Czech Republic with a very nice experience.
4	This is the first time I use Kiwi and so far It's been a good experience. The chat service is so helpful and fast, specially thanks to the agent that helped me, Martin Carter. :) I was doubting a lot about which flight to buy, he found me the best price, helped me with some doubts about luggage and other extra topics relating the flight. Thanks and hope to keep having a good experience with Kiwi.
5	Kiwi chat is very usefull to solve difficult questions. Andrea, Rakim, Hana, Alkim helped me every time! They were very nice, friendly and supportive when solving my problems!I recommend Kiwi and their support team no doubs! 5 stars!:) Sara
1	"What a bad experience ! Few days before my flight I got an email saying that I would have to do the check in online. Already surprised ( because I was never asked to do that so many days before the departure), I went to the website and I couldn`t add my family`s passport information. I got a bit nervous but tried to reach out to KIWI but they didn't pick up the phone or chat. I ended up going to the airport without my check in and had to pay 1.440 dkk (about $200) to be checked in at the airport.I tried to not be stressed but I spent my entire trip in Italy expecting to get a new email  from KIWI many days before the departure, so I could do the on line check in again. 72 hours before my flight I couldn't manage my booking online again. I tried to reach out KIWI on their website and I only got the automatic answer they have in their chat.I tried to call and after 40 min I gave up. Tried again next day and nothing. After many hours trying, I found a company on the internet (<http://GetHuman.com|GetHuman.com>) that I paid $20 to contact Kiwi. The person from GetHuman only solved my problem after spending 4 hours on hold with KIWI. In the end, The agent from GetHuman said that I was not even booked for the flight. Even though I had reservation number from KIWI on my email. I was not even on the passengers list. My flight was 7am and I would arrive at the airport early in the morning without even having my family`s name on the list! If it was not for GetHuman then we would have to pay 1440 dkk again! This is absurd. I would not even give them 1 star if i could give them zero. It would be unfair to say ""Kiwi"" has bad customer service, because in my experience, they don't even have a customer service department. The only decent thing to do, is to refund the 1440dkk i had to pay in the airport because Kiwi's website and customer service wasn't working."
5	I am use this site to search the cheapest flight and it is so easy to do the transactions and the best thing that I am so appreciate is their service because it is too quickly reply and really help you to slice your problemsI am suggest everyone who ever try this site please try it and u will really love it like me

5	Booked a flight for December and entered some of my details incorrectly. Was able to contact Natalya P using the live chat and she sorted it for me in next to no time. Very happy with service so far. Hoping for a good flight in December :)
5	I used Kiwi for the first time and I got a good price and a simple way of booking
1	To pull one's leg- that is the best phrase that I am having experience with Kiwi. Even though I put my middle name on the reservation at Kiwi customer support claims that I had never putted and want to charge me in addition extra 30 EUR to put my middle name on flight ticket. How I feel? Cheated, the simplest word that should be putted to Kiwi's motto.Even though I have showed under 1st ticket that my middle name has been putted (how airlines should know my middle name, if I do not gave to kiwi before?). For this I never had any answer from the portal.I seriously dissuade the idea of booking flight ticket with them, specially that I have spent over 1000  euro for flight tickets. I expect that at least company will have enough honor and cover mistake they have made!
4	Evereything worked fine, didn't have to contact customer service. Everything ran according to what was contracted.
1	I am absolutely disgusted with <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>. My e-ticket clearly stated that I was allowed 10kg. Then I get an email telling me to pay the 2 x 10kg baggage cost at the airport and they will reimburse me!! Through Live Chat I said if I had know that I would not have booked the flight. I wanted to cancel but they said it would cost me 20 Euros! What ridiculous amount will the airline charge me for 2 checked bags and how long will it take to get reimbursed from <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>!!! NEVER AGAIN WILL I BOOK THROUGH THIS AGENCY !!
5	We are travelling 9 people to a wedding in Romania, and someone clicked something wrong and i couldn´t get our boarding passes, Kiwi support stepped in and everything was sorted in less then 12 hours, thank you guys and girls, was perfect help.
5	First of all very fast and efficient platform for flight booking. And Ivana Vlahovic from the Service Team went the extra mile for me.It was my own mistake that I had mistyped my passport details on online booking. However within less than 24hrs she got my boarding pass corrected so I could pick it up in Bangkok!Great service and thanks again!Thomas
5	Everything went well with my trip from Portugal to a greek island! Thanks to Veronika that quickly solved an issue with one boarding pass! I'll fly again with Kiwi. com! =D
5	Just the day before leaving I realized there was a typo error in the name of the boarding tickets and Johana contacted the different companies I was flying with and managed to change the name in the boarding tickets in less than 24H.  which is amazing since I contacted her through <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> at 22:00h which is pretty late. Thank you!
5	Operator Jan was really helpful and fixed my missing ticket numbers in no time. Really professional. Thank you guys and Merry Xmas!
5	I had some problem with my e ticket. So I had chat with very nice guy whose name is Filip. Very nicely and quick service. I appreciate it. Thx
5	I called the assistance number as listed on my kiwi booking and was assisted very competently by Yulia Yurovich. She was extremely thorough in her research to provide me with correct information and pricing with my carry on luggage from dual airlines, and request for my confirmation number.  This was my first time booking through Kiwi as directed by the Skyscanner app. Until this helpful aid from Yulia, my positive review was only with the Skyscanner app.  Now I would readily recommend Kiwi to anyone and will not hesitate to use the Kiwi service in the future, almost entirely due to the excellent service provided by Ms. Yurovich.
5	I want to really appreciate the excellent support given by the customer service. Last Saturday night we ran in a trouble in Toronto Airport during our Layover for an overseas trip. The flight company didn't want to help us so much in the airport.Kiwi's customer service was looking at midnight for the best alternative for us, calling us several times. The staff was very, very supportive by phone and helped us to keep the calm there. We were traveling with a baby. Kiwi also offered to stay in a hotel waiting the new flight.I only can say that Kiwi really did what the company announces on its web page.I absolutely will schedule my next family trip with Kiwi because I'm confident Kiwi is responsive and keeps with what they announce. Unfortunately I cannot say the same about some other trip agencies I've used in the past.A+ for Kiwi.
4	a gentleman named Brice Hairion offered the best assistance possible in my situation. thanks Brice and to you and all the staff have a very nice day.
5	Brice Hairion was more than helpful. I had immediate answers to all my inquiries. Thanks guys!
5	I was very easy to make the booking, and when i found out that i had make a mistake, I used the chat and in 5 minutes Bek from the servicecenter had solved my problem. Thank you
5	I received great service from Thomas Knox. In less than an hour, he was able to resolve a week-long issue with flight changes. He saved our first trip to Europe from disaster and should be commended for a job well done.
5	She provided excellent service!
5	Basilio was he live chat who assisted me in a quick friendly efficient and professional manner. 5 stars for Basillio! Thanks bro :)
5	Milica was an outstanding person to help me through the process of getting my payment to get through. She was very helpful and very understanding. Also a joy to speak with!
5	One day before my flight departure I had some unanswered questions in regards to airlines carry on luggage policies. I Went online and met with one of KIWI's agent named Daniel who helped me with the online check in and answering my many questions. The agent was very professional and was so helpful every steps of the way. KIWI highly recommended for great customer service!
5	I booked a flight with 3 stops via 3 different Airlines and it was Super easy and cheap! One plane was canceled and i was unable to reach my connecting flights, kiwi and their Super helpful and friendly Agents helped me Find new flights free of Charge, they did this twice while being very friendly and Professional. Thank you Kiwi, and thank you Fillip!
5	Kira was able to help me save an extra $25 by personally contacting the airline for a checked baggage price than even <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> was offering! Very thankful for her help.
5	All service during booking and check in,they make it very easy!
5	I was having trouble figuring out how to secure a certain seat for my flights, and Jan Lukasek was so helpful.  We used the live chat, and very quickly resolved the issue... So much easier than hours spent on hold with other airlines and agencies in the past.  Thank you!
5	Skypicker have a very good customer service and I recently talked to Sehii that works for skypicker, Sehii were very friendly and helpful =D
4	I've had Tomáš MuÅ¾ík who's been trying to help me out of my predicament. i entered the wrong date and it wasn't until i booked and confirmed it that i realised i had the first departure date wrong. :(Tomas has been awesome in trying to sort it out for me. Here's hoping he can work some magic for me but above all he's been really understanding.Thank youQ
5	Skypicker offered great price on my flights. It also responses my question timely. Special thanks to Jonathan Ronald Muller Eghan, the travel consultant. He returned my email and had my enquiries satisfied so effectively that I didn't have to worry anything.
5	I had some doubts with my IcelandAir booking from Chicago to Copenhagen. My PNR was not showing up as per my booking & my name  also had some alterations in their website (even though everything looked fine in <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com>). I called in for a live chat & Miroslava P was attending the live chat. She cleared all of my doubts & confusion & assured that my booking had no problem by calling the airlines on my behalf. That was so nice of her & I never had such great customer service ever before.Thank you Mirka! :)- Abhishek
5	Many thanks for all your efforts! We are so happy about your helpful staff members. While booking and afterwards we were always overwhelmed about the fast interaction via chat or mail.Thank you so much. We can now enjoy many flight segments of our all around the world tour!
3	It is my first time booking with kiwi so naturally, I decided to research to check for its legitimacy. Honestly, the many comments about the horrible, horrible experiences and the many things that went wrong from cancellation to worse stuff is a risk I am not sure I can take on my journey with 2 layovers and 3 different planes. Any advice?

5	I originally ordered a flight from Tel-Aviv to Madrid through kiwi with Wizz-Air. However, my flight got cancelled and I was offered an alternatives. The alternatives weren't great at all, but I took what I they gave me because I didn't had much choice. In the alternatives flights I accepted Kiwi forgot to add luggage to one of the flights and I contacted them and after a few calls they fixed it. I've talked to many of the representatives on Kiwi, but I had the most great time talking to Igor Guzvinec. He was very kind, very helpful and tried his best to give me the best results for my complaints. I would definitely order a reservation through Kiwi once again if Igor will be my agent. Thank you, Igor.
4	I booked the wrong flight and called a few hours after. Lukas has been very helpful to arrange me. He didn't manage to to totally refund me but was able to find me a good flight and I've only lost about 40$.
1	I've purchased a ticket from that web site. Then I received below mail on 19.03.2016 from skypicker;Schedule change 657 385;From: FAO (Faro) To: CGN (Bonn)Departure: Date: May 20 2016 Day: Friday Time: 07:10:00Arrival: Date: May 20 2016 Day: Friday Time: 11:15:00From: CGN (Bonn) To: IST (Istanbul)Departure: Date: May 20 2016 Day: Friday Time: 19:35:00Arrival: Date: May 20 2016 Day: Friday Time: 23:55:00That's not acceptable offer. So I'm traveling from İstanbul and there are 2 airports in here. I'll travel from SAW (to Porto) which is in Asian Side and I'm planing to park my car in that airport but this offer arrives IST which is in European side. Also, I paid more money for short flight time and transfer duration.Later they offered me below alternative;From: FAO (Faro) To: CGN (Bonn)Departure: Date: May 20 2016 Day: Friday Time: 07:10:00Arrival: Date: May 20 2016 Day: Friday Time: 11:15:00From: CGN (Bonn) To: BGY (Milano)Departure: Date: May 20 2016 Day: Friday Time: 08:35:00Arrival: Date: May 20 2016 Day: Friday Time: 10:00:00Airline: RyanairFrom: BGY (Milano) To: SAW (Istanbul)Departure: Date: May 20 2016 Day: Friday Time: 14:05:00Arrival: Date: May 20 2016 Day: Friday Time: 17:45:00Airline: Pegasus1st flight arrive to Bonn at 11:15 then 2nd one departure from Bonn at 08:35 :))))))) What kind of Customer Care Specialist can offer this kind of offer????I've sent lots of mail to their mail box but no body helps me :((( I tried to call them to find a solution and talked with Eva Prochazkova, Adam Jacques, Donald Kumi-Agyare etc..... but no solution.Today is the 12th day still each day I have sent reminders about changing the flight and find a reasonable solution but they don't help me and don't reply my mails...
4	I had low expectations using them for the first time, generally because I trust myself to find better flights than what automatic sites does. However, Skypicker was able to a find a better alternative than myself and other similar sites I compared it too. I was surprised to learn about their guarantee. I (fortunately) did not need to use it, so I do not know how smoothly it actually works, but it sounds surprisingly good.
4	I liked the service because I'm used to have the boarding pass at the airport. This time I had them to my e-mail, all of them, and several days before the flight.
5	I have used Kiwi multiple times now and they are a really great company! First off, I use <http://momondo.com|momondo.com> to find a large aggregation of flights that I want to pick from. Then I scroll to find the flight through kiwi because they are one of the few booking websites with higher than 1 star reviews. The reason I say it's great for traveling abroad is because they have a live customer service chat that allows you to do everything over the chat room, instead of calling the company. This allows you to use them in any country you are in with access to WiFi. Other companies force you to call, which can get complicated if you do not have phone service in that given country. My customer service representative that I chatted with, Michal, was extremely diligent in getting my refund processed and contacted the finance department directly to expedite the process. Great job!
3	@20sTravel What are your thoughts on discount flight finders like Skypicker? <https://t.co/KE0smolWul>
5	Smooth and reliable costume service. The agent Ajit, was extremely kind, and solved anything I needed.
5	This was my first time using Kiwi, so I was hesitant. But, when my first flight was delayed so much that I was going to miss the second flight I needed to get home, I was immediately helped. Kiwi answered promptly whenever I called and put me on the next available flight, and I got home only a couple of hours later than originally planned. Thank you.
1	I bought a ticket from Munich to Seattle and Kiwi bundled three different airlines that didn't have baggage deals so I had to leave the airport every transfer to re-check my bags making the ticket, which was originally cheap, wayyy more expensive than it would have been to just buy directly from an airline. I also noted checked bags when I booked through them but when they checked me into one of my flights they didn't add a bag making it more expensive at the airport.
5	Really fast service that helped me book my tickets to Iceland instantly, giving me a fantastic price on my trip. Vendula was extremely helpful in assisting me with all of the process and I would recommend the service!
5	I just want to give a shout out to Skypicker for their great service. I contacted them in their 24/7 chat regarding a change i needed to do for my flight. I got a quick answer from Alex after I explained what I needed help with. He promised me to get in contact with the airline and call me as soon as he knew more about the possibility to change the flight. Not only did he call me to say that the change had been done and I would expect a email very soon with my knew ticket information, he also called me later just to confirm that everything was in order and that I had recived all the information i needed with my updated flight ticket. That is what I call service.  Thank you Alex for the great comfort and service you provided. Now I just hope my flight will go as well as web service.
5	I had a problem with the booking and payment.Lusine has accompanied me in a chat between 12:24 PM and 1:37 PM and was very helped.A maraton and top performance. Thank you Lusine you're a top service for your company.Problem solved thanks to Lusine.I will be your customer all the time !!!Michel
5	I booked a flight yesterday, very good rates. I needed assistance with putting my passport details on my booking (as was told I would have to pay at airport) and Tanya v was very efficient and helpful. I will use service again
4	I am very pleased with the services of kiwi.I had a problem with my boarding pass. I probably submitted wrong information, but the agent responded immediately, repairing the error and  I got a new boarding pass. Special thanks to Rebecca, I spoke with her on phone. She was extremely friendly , attentive and helpfull.
4	A little bit of confusion with boarding pass for our vacation. Everything solved with the help of  Kristyna Mlcuchova by live chat!!! Now we have to hope just in good weather!!!!
5	Perfect customer services :) Special thanks to the agents :)
5	Thanks very good people from Skypicker.You keep a very good eye on everything and even I made a mistake you solved perfect and also its so nice when you send an email that the response is so very quick. Go on like this and for me only Skypicker in the future!!! Thanks!!
5	Neil is the man. I've spoken to him about helping me with adding luggage to my flight.He did this and even sent a personal email about this for me, with prices and his personal oppinion for me, which i took.I've spoken to him more than once and i'd like to handle all my Skypicker errands with this man.Great costumer service.Oh and btw, you guys picked up instantly and didnt let me wait hours, which is greatly appriciated!:)#Neilforpresident
4	"My booking details under ""Manage my booking"" was showing ""Boarding pass: available on Sat Nov 19"" but my flight departs the day before on Friday. This scares me so I chatted with the agent at <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com>, Jan Lukasek and he checked the details with the airline (Norwegian) and confirmed my flight details are still correct and what I was seeing purely a technical glitch with the website thinking I had online check-in (which I don't). I had an extreme fear that the airline wasn't going to allow me to get my boarding pass and delay me until Saturday but Jan said everything should be fine. This made me feel better because I can't miss this flight or I will miss my other connecting flights and everything will be ruined. I am only giving 4 stars mostly for Jan and minus 1 star because of the glitch on the website practically giving me a panic attack."
5	Thanks Aura
5	Very good service. I have put the wrong nationality for my friend but Skypicker helped me correct it. Generally I got very good assistance also was informed when the schedule changed for my flight so I could adjust my plans for arrival in advance. Thanks a lot for your service!
5	Excellent customer service from sky scanner.. Had a slight bit of confusion with my boarding passes but the 24/7 live chat was there on hand to help sort this out without any hesitation! Special thanks to Peter who was extremely helpful and answered all of my questions! Very affordable flights and great customer service.
5	I was in a chat with Adrian, so fantastic. Clear, precise and willing to help. Great Staff :) Recommended.
3	Skypicker:  As we grow, we know we can rely on the SoftLayer platform <https://t.co/9noNC6oynt>
5	My online check in didn't work when i first tried it, and after i forgot to do it. I received an email from KIWI about having to online check in or else i would have to pay Ryanairs fee. This dude named  Dániel Péter helped me with the check in, adding luggage (since Ryanair are strict on luggage) and helped me with several other small stuff. Great and fast customer service!
5	Thank you so much Anna Alaxinova. She's really so helpful and kind regardless to all the stressful questions I asked her about booking. I'm looking forward I wouldn't get any problems on my flight after I book. I really hope it's not only at first when booking and so, will get a proper, quick and very efficient response on your team. I'm really so thankful she answered all my inquiries. My pleasure to give you a positive feedback Ms. Anna :)
5	He was very polite and helpful..My JV was done very quick. Thanks a lot. Awesome job
5	I'm ver y satisfied with extremely help of this company with a problem take place with our booking. Specially with Natali. Her help and attention is invaluable. We are so glad with her job. Congratulations again
4	I mistyped the expiration date of my passport and Greg rectified the mistake in one click. Quick and Easy, me like.
1	"I am in my 60's, and am technically challenged.  So, i am unable to navigate your website with ease - especially since it has misinformation.  I have been trying to add a bag to my reservation, and the price keeps changing.  Also, i paid for a bag in May, and it shows as still ""processing"".  Your online Chat service is a joke.  it just refers me to another website.  i called yesterday, was on hold, then tried hard to understand the English of the rep.  I fear what might happen if my trip runs into trouble, as i don't believe that i can reach you.  So far, i will not use Kiwi again."
5	I made a booking through Skypicker sometimes ago  Due to unforeseen circumstances I had to make a change to the booking.  Jiří Červenka came to my rescue. Jiri was fast, reliable, friendly and on the ball.  It so hard to find such good service nowadays especially in Africa.Thank you Jiri and Skypicker for making this change painless. I will definitely use this service again.Vanessa Quintela (Cape Town)
3	Airfares for up to 90% cheaper? @skypickercom says they can make it happen in my @TODAYshow story: <https://t.co/3ILtBSQWTG>
5	I had trouble with my reservation because I accidentally typed in wrong contact information. After I contacted the Customer service, Agent Tamara fixed it in less than 2 minutes and saved me from having actual trouble! Thank you :)
1	terrible customer service, didn't check me in, and didn't tell me there was an issue either. just sent me a blank email that's supposed to have my boarding pass
5	I had a few questions about my reservation and Radim answered all my questions so nicely! Awesome customer service ever! :)
5	There were some problems with an email address. I ask for help -Martin he a magician !!) very politely and professionally solved all my questions. I would be proud of this employee! :) Thank you, Martin!)
5	From Kyra she help me on setting my passport.
5	Awesome excellent experience!  Bogdan was great and very helpful--best service ever!
1	Horrible. Avoid using them. I've tried to book a flight twice today and they've caused errors twice. Now they refuse to cancel or refund. First it was a wrong airport then wrong dates. I select the airport and date I want but somehow they still list things that shouldn't be options. Then refuse to fix it. I won't use them again.
5	Had some delay getting the boarding passes so I got into a live chat with one of the representatives by the name of James and he was extremely helpful! He helped me get my boarding passes less than 10 minutes after he and I chatted!5/5. Would ask for help again!
4	I found Skypicker through web searches for a cheap flight to Trinidad only a week before I wanted to leave. Their ordering process was super simple and the flight was way cheaper than I found anywhere else. My bank did call me from fraud prevention as soon as I had paid as the company is based out of the U.K. Everything at the airport was smooth for my first check in, in fact Skypicker had checked me in early enough that I was bumped to first class, which was awesome! When I got to my layover, I did have to go out of security back to the check in counter for my second flight to pay and check in bags which was pretty annoying. I wish they had been more clear about paying for bags during the ordering process. Otherwise, it was a great experience and I'll prob be using Skypicker again in the future!
5	"I phoned in today as I made a smallMistake with the title of my friends name and put ""mr"" instead of ""ms"". I spoke to a gentleman called Radek P who was of great help and went out of his way to help me amend this and contacted the Norwegian airline for myself. Thanks very much for your exceptional help Radek :)"
5	I just booked tickets for my Europe and I received e-tickets in Korean as I chose that my nationality is Korean. I rather have E-tickets in English some reason. and I had to go through live chat and I met Dominika. Dominika helped me within  second. was very fast and nice service. I really appreciate  for the help and very good deal for the flights. Thanks heaps!
5	I would recommend this company to anyone.
5	Thank you for an excellent service and you help all the way through when changing my flight, booking extra luggage etc. Thanks a lot.,
5	Syed Waqar Hassan,Was very helpful a pleasure to speak with and fully helped me out with my situation as step by step issues, Thank You for your help I look forward in fly with <http://skypicker.com|skypicker.com> in the near futureSincerely,Celina Tatiana Delsia Hubbard
5	Thank you @skypickercom. Had a amazing trip which included many connections and traveling across continents. No issues! :airplane_departure:
5	30 seconds :)
5	I got super great service from Aliz, very nice and aswered fast. Thank you very much :)
4	Website's not that accommodating- after booking my flight, I was informed in several e-mails that further passport information was required, but I found no option on the website to manually enter in this information myself. Luckily I was able to get everything sorted out via the online chat- the customer service was truly efficient and quick. Thanks to Pedro for sorting everything out!
4	Skypicker has good prices, good airlines, no hussle or hidden fees. Just get what you pay for with no problems at all.
1	Fraudulent charge put through on my card.  Told I would be issued a refund minus a 20euro per ticket fee!  Called airline to cancel and they will cancel the flight but Kiwi will not refund???  Impossible to get someone on phone.  Online FORM says someone will get back to you in 30 days!!!! UNACCEPTABLE!!!!
5	Our trip to 24h of Le Mans was just awesome, thank you Martin Carter for letting all this happen :)
1	"Attempted twice to purchase an airline ticket from Kiwi but was a unable to be ""verified"" by their credit card evaluation team despite answering dozens of questions on the phone and spending more on the long distance phone calls than the cost of the ticket!! I'll admit, the customer service was friendly and they tried to help but could do absolutely nothing for a customer because they can't even tell you why your transaction is being cancelled. I followed their suggestion and tried multiple different credit cards, all cards associated with the top major card issuers (Visa, Amex) and nothing wrong with the cards. They have a security team in Isreal according to their agent that reviews your information and if anything is ""suspicious"" your transaction is cancelled, you lose your airline booking so if you found a nice deal and attempted to book it's now gone, and it will take weeks to get your refund. Very poor, indeed. We all want to make sure that our credit card security is being taken seriously but this has been a ridiculous process with Kiwi. The serious online players use processes like ""verified by visa"" and similar systems for Amex or MasterCard that verify you straight away online. ... If you are in the market to purchase an airline ticket I recommend that you visit a provider that will actually sell you one, not Kiwi."
1	dodgy site. booked a ryanair flight and Kiwi will not allow me to do my own check in (something I could've done if I booked directly with the carrier). avoid
5	I am very satisfied with the service provided via chat by Skypicker. I forgot to introduce my passport details but fortunately an agent called Karen was able to sort it out in a proficient way. Not only he solved my problem rapidly but was also very nice and professional. I will ensure to check Skypicker for future flights.
5	This began as a horrible experiment (mostly operator error), I called the number provided for the US which was in New York...they sucked! Then, i chatted with Mr. Victor S. and he helped make everything better. After exercising all of his tools, her transferred me to his supervisor KATE-a ANGEL. She promptly remedied my problem, proving everyone wrong about not being able to change/refund flights.We corresponded for HOURS and now, all is WELL! IM SO HAPPYVictor and Kate were both kind, patient, and very helpful
5	I really like to congratulate Skypicker for the great customer service they provide! I called in regards to a luggage information I required and Tomáš Mužík was very helpful in providing me the information that I  needed. He was efficient and quite fast in obtaining me that information. Furthermore, he was very diligent in his work and went above and beyond to answer an additional question regarding a change that I might make to my flight.Great job, Skypicker! Keep up the good work!
5	We spent long hours comparing the prices of low-cost airlines for a large group and then I discovered Kiwi - all our work was now done in a couple of minutes. The search engine is really good. We booked the flights and the experience was very pleasant, excellent customer service as well! One of our flight legs was changed by the airline and Kiwi supported us and found another connecting flight free of charge.Just a note, if you are not booking complex itineraries, have a look at the airline website to check if the flights are not cheaper there.Overall, very good experience and we now recommend it to all our friends.
3	#cloud Skypicker offers flights for up to 90 percent less with a cloud-based ticketing portal... <https://t.co/mqIYpOf7E5> @thoughtsoncloud
5	I had a pleasure to work while booking with Luis Silva as consultan, thank You so much. So personal and professional help. My gratitude.
5	Thanks Bek spectacular your attention !!! SUPER fast and efficientTHANK YOU so MUch ANALIA
5	By mistake I booked two flight ticket, instead of one. I contacted skypicker by phone and they cancelled my booking. Thanks for skypicker the quick help, I hope eveyone will have a good experience with them.
4	"Firstly, my first time using them and likely not my last.  I had no delays, smooth flights and professional service when I needed to call or email.My booking consisted of 6 flights, so a little touch of confusion for me also but that was my choice and some flights needing checked in online, some they checked in for me and some I had to do myself.  I got this though.Now I asked to pay for window seats (I have an issue where I have shoulders like an American football player and the space where the window is is perfect for my size.  They sent me links to pay (they expire in 24 hours) but I had such a stressful time with work that I missed the payment time a few times and the one where I didn't miss it, they payment service kept rejecting my card (not sure why either) So I finally get the time to pay and some of my flights don't have window seats left (my fault)  but some do so I book and pay. When I get to airport I realise the flight with paid window seat doesn't have a window seat, my nightmare, but I was on the isle which is better than the middle. So I didn't bother complaining as what can I do.He issue is that they emailed me during my trip away to let me know that they can't book my window seat anymore.. dread.. I had around 8000km to travel and it actually played on my mind as the fear of travelling that distance in discomfort was horrible.Checked in for my flight only to realise I was in the middle seat and I was stuck next to 2 big guys and had the most soul destroying, uncomfortable flight home.  I couldn't move and had to basically sit side on to get any room to move. My legs were aching and my back so sore that I was an emotional wreck when I landed some 10 hours later.I travel a lot and get on planes around 20 times a year social wise and I always get window seats for comfort. Booking and paying for a service, I expect that service.  Not a sorry and a refund, that doesn't cut it.  If you booked and stayed a the only hotel in town and you got there to a ""sorry no rooms but here's a refund"" you'd not be best pleased.I'm likely going to try them one more time due to the fact they seem like they genuinely care what the guest wants and thinks. I've bookedMy next flights with BA but my Christmas ones I'll maybe try them out again and see what happens.Pros - Brillaint customer services and prices/carriersCons - if you offer it and take money for it, provide the service. No excuses. Excuses don't cause smiles."
5	I would like to point out the great service I received from Selorm today. He took the time to carefully treat my case, even if the issue wasn't resolve, I do feel he did the best he could.
5	Bogdan C. helped me solve an important issue I had with my booking; he was really polite, professional and customer oriented. So, thank you Bogdan & <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> for your support.
1	Unfortunately disappointing - i booked and paid my flight from Germany to new Zealand, already bought the necessary transit visas for the stop over countries - and received a message later that there are no seats available on those flights! And the refund of the money can take up to 10 days apparently. Not sure if this happens often but I'd certainly wouldn't recommend risking it!
1	Very bad experience with <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> - they have confirmed a wrong time of the flight by 5 hours even it is a regular flight. After I have found this out at the airport very early in the morning I have contacted a customers support - at that time only English speaking. But it has been very confused lady who did not helped me at all. Later on I have contacted a local customers support in Czech - but this time it has been a very young lady who hardly knows what to say. In the end they have offered me a 50 EUR voucher for their services. Maybe they though it is a good joke...
4	I organized the Ryanair-flights for me and two friends with some changes concerning baggage, return-flight and so on. All my questions by email were answered promptly, helpfully and friendly-
5	Had a problem with our connecting flight due to technical problems - immediate reply and help by Lucie Pupalova and Samuel Barkoci... great service, really! Thanks!
5	I'd like to thank kiwi's staff especially Daria Shokha who helped me change my flight and speed up the process , kiwi's staff were very helpful and explained thing very clearfully ! Thanks to them !
1	This is  really insane. I could not add an extra  baggage 16 hours before the departure, because they did not tell me their email address or the last 4 digits of the credit card they paid. This is the stupidest company I have ever seen. Be aware about this company.
5	Monica was very helpful..She understand customer problem and takes steps immediately to solve it
5	Lost me emails for details to flights rang up and got it all sorted in no time, Babak was a big help to cool dude thanks a lot !!
1	Horrible service screwed me on booking a flight took my money and didn't guarantee me a flight
1	My limit card very low but your system force custumer pay again ticket . In this case <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> FAULT ! I want to cancel all my ticket please you help mento cancel all ticket and refund 100%
5	Used this company to book returns flights from UK to South Africa and Brunei and was able to get very competitive fares not just with low cost airlines, but with quality carriers, such as British Airways, Emirates and Singapore Airlines and saved ourselves hundreds of £££. There was a small hitch when one of the Asian airlines changed their schedule, which would have disrupted our travel plans, but Kiwi offered to pay for an alternative booking and honoured their promise, albeit with some delay. Travel consultants I talked to were very polite, helpful and pleasant to deal with. Would strongly recommend this company withour reservation and will certainly use them again in the future.
5	Kiwi's customer care is perfect and many companies should learn from them! I had a plenty of questions considering my journey and Vendulka T. helped me with all of them. I was surprised with such willingness and immediacy of her reaction. Now I can say Kiwi is not just a vendor, but a partner I can rely on.
5	@CatHamm Awesome destination coverage! Do your readers know they can save a ton on airfare to these places with <https://t.co/6MN8N4GW19>?

5	Miroslava P was very helpfull and kind! thank you for the professionalism!
5	I still don't understand the pricing policies of low-cost airlines but <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> was able to combine totally cheapest option from the Ryanair flights. BTW, the Stansted is terrible place so I'd avoid it next time if I could but it has to do nothing with <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>.The <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> web pages were easy to use, the booking proces simple and I really welcomed the Kiwi guarantee for solving potential trouble with changing the flights.
5	Thanks for the quick response Mariya Potello, check in done in time.
5	Fantastic service from Kiwi specially from Talei Waibuta who helped me get to my destination after a long delay that caused me to miss my change over flight. the company i was to fly with did not help and said i had to wait 2 days, but Talei Waibuta  took ownership and helped me get the next available flight out. Thanks Talei Waibuta  for such fantastic service.
5	This site has really impressed me with it&#39;s speed and flexibility. I used to be a devout Skyscanner user, but Skypicker has now been added to my toolbelt, especially for flights within Europe since it also gathers flights from the budget airlines. Excellent stuff!
1	There is an unauthorized use of my credit card in kiwi.com.it's so crazy.and i have contact customer service a lot of time.and i provided everything my card.But he told me  it was not recognized as fraudulent.it's so <http://crazy.My|crazy.My> credit card is used in two websites.And another websites help me to slovethis problem as soon as possible.but in kiwi i have sent 5 emails.but they can't do anything for me.
5	Excellent customer service and the guarantee is actually lived up to. I had delays and worked with me in the best possible and friendly manner. Would recommend and will def book again
5	Awesome and excellent customer service and assistanceI'd like to thank Samael and Aura for the wonderful, awesome and excellent assistance provided when I needed help with my booking (change flights ... change of departure date). They were really very helpful and they promptly helped me to clarify all my issues which I encountered with <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> website as well as the changing of departure date.  I definitely recommend the service of <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> agents, especially that of Samael and Aura to anyone out there who has aged old impression of unfriendly, hostile customer service and uncommitted online agents. Thank you once again for your friendly and lovely human touch.
5	Well I searched over the internet for 5 days looking for flights for my dad to come home for christmas and after reading hundreds of bad reviews from budgetair and edream and etc. I was lucky to come come across skypickers even though it was most expensive one. I liked how website showed you included tax and fees and chose baggage. I went on there reviews and everything was spectacular. no bad gripes one or two. but compared what I read on other pages it was good.  I noticed the live chat people were talking about but couldn't find on my browser so I contacted by email and they told me to change my browser so I did. Then the chat window appeared I got help with everything and answer all my questions. I was so stressed booking tickets for my dad to come home to meet his grandchildren the assistance  I got was brilliant. compared to other website premium number. I was very impressed. the lady made feel comfortable and reassured of what I had to do. everything was confirmed quickly and got my e-ticket quickly. I also needed assistance as my father walked with aid I have told the lady this and she told me that she would contact the airline and say my dad need special assistance. and she email me back. I'm so overwhelmed with the help from this website now just got to see if everything runs smooth as the transaction.  Fingers all crossed away to send everything to my dad through dhl today. So to anyone I would recommend this service.
5	I appreciated the customer support/service very much. I got help through the chat system speaking with Natalia and it went very quick and efficient, I would say easier than using a phone. I am very happy with the information i was given and look forward to book with <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> again. Best Regards, Patricia
1	It's sad to say that I can start by saying that I show up to the airport and that I missed my flight because skykeeper did not send my info to the airline. Since I couldn't solve this problem on time I  purchase a new flight ticket to my destination because supposedly they investigated my case and there was no prove that I went to the airport.. (I wish I had access to the cameras at the airport to show them myself) but of course I would hv to pay a lawyer for that. Then since my ticket was a round trip ticket I wanted to use the one coming back and I had to fight that like if I had never had pay for it. (Thank goodness I had proof from my credit card that this ticket was purchased and a picture of my confirmation number). BUT I still didn't get what I purchase. I'm leaving tomorrow and they refused to change my flight to my original time. My new ticket says that I have a 14 hours stop waiting period in Florida when before my waiting period was an hour and a couple of minutes. I am so disappointed and so upset at this people. I do not recommend them at all. They do answer your emails and phone calls promptly but they didnt help me as to change my flight back to the original one or to offer me any compensation for my leaving flight that I missed due to their mistake. Be aware that they don't let you print out your itinerary or boarding ticket until the day before you flight out. Be careful you might go through the same situation I went thru. Your itinerary might get change.
5	Service tres reactif et suivit de Mohamed qui a resolu rapidement les problemes. Je le remercie de ses reponses positives et rapides. Tres bon contact et travail, bravo, je reviendrai chez Skypicker, que je conseille.
5	I missed my correspondence flight due to weather conditions. Last minute Anastassia rebooked me a flight no charges... Amazing service!!!
1	I booked airline ticket with <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> through fare compare site, but in retrospect chose this by mistake.  I booked Riyadh/Singaore leg but had several problems:1.  They don't issue ticket, but collect money from you and separately booked the ticket.  So you don't get the ticket or confirmation, immediately.   You get the ticket in 24-48 hours.2. This looks like a Group travel agency, so you cannot check the ticket with airline, do online check with the airline directly etc.3.  While they mentioned that you need to take the luggage from domestic and reconfirm for international, but they didn't mention that the domestic and international airport is some 25kms and 40 mins away by taxi.  As my family was going alone, I had to book a separate ticket to go to Riyadh to see them off.4.  You could buy the ticket from the airline directly for up to 30% (yes 30% cheaper), so I am not sure if 'farecompare' legitimately gives the best option and rate to customers.  We could not book our meal online/through kiwi, had to go without meal for a long haul flight.  We were charged for the checkin baggage, but the airline gives 1 free check in baggage.  Even teh meal had to be purchased, where as it is free by the airline.5.  Lastly don't be fooled by the name or contact centre no with +65 (Singapore), this is a Czech Republic company, which please be aware.6.  They offer a useless guarantee, if the flight is cancelled they will find an alternate flight (of similar price) or they will refund the balance for the unused journey.  This is actually a fraud, no way you can find another flight for the unused ticket fare.Having said all these, I must credit them for their customer service, they are available 24/7, limited waiting time and they try to help.  Most of the issues mentioned are about the company policy and not their support staff.Overall, I lost more than $350 and not a happy experience.  Try to go to a safer and well known aggregator.  I will not chose them again.
5	I was looking for some cheap flights to get from Düsseldorf to Auckland, but all the other airlines and websites were so expensive. So i finally found Skypicker and they offered me a great price (only 1100 from DUS->PAR PAR->BEIJING BEIJING->ACK). After my booking, one of the airlines slightly changed depature time and Skypicker called me twice to make sure i noticed that. Would really recommand booking your flights with Skypicker!
4	Hello,I would like to thanks 'Adam Jelínek' for his welcome. I’ve a bad level in English, but He was very prepossessing with me.I’m very satisfied to the customer support.Kind regards
1	"I had to book a last minute trip. I booked with Kiwi as the price was fair.I then received an email saying that my booking status was ""being processed"" and that it could take up to 240 minutes. It was a long 4 hours for me. after 4 hours, still no news from Kiwi. I spent 30 minutes on the live chat. They were giving me hope that my flight could finally be booked. Then I received an email saying that they refunded me.I finaly booked another fight that is more expensive and a lot longer (1 layover more and 8+ hours more).Thanks Kiwi! You screwed my weekend."

4	Until now very good service, thank you very much Eleonora!
5	I made a terrible mistake with a couple of bookings, so started an online chat with Kiwi. I was expecting to get frustrated with having to deal with automated responses on the other side, but was pleasantly surprised with the actual service - I started to enjoy the chat (say, what?). I know! I'd just like to say a massive thank you to Jan S at Kiwi for fixing my bookings - superstar! Although I didn't get a refund for one booking (low cost airline policies), they were able to change the booking of another flight for a relatively low cost, which was great.I'm not sure what the other agents are like at Kiwi, but Jan definitely made the experience much less stressful than it should have been.

4	Thanks lot for the help that I receive response from this company very quickly.
5	It was the first time booking with <http://skypicker.com|skypicker.com>. and I can say it was great ,i'm very pleased with this service, I had to add extra legroom to my tickets   and with the help of Jiří Červenka on live chat, it made my process so much easier. Process was smooth and quick. The best service !.Thank you !
5	The booking of my multiple itineraries was easy and pain free.  When i had an issue with them, needing to add middle names to the bookings, US support was quick and attentive, handling the issue.  Specifically, Luis Silva and Sofia Kallas were very helpful and took care of everything for me.  I may never book using another travel site again!
5	Excellent customer service Michael Angelo. I feel encouraged to choose <http://KIWI.COM|KIWI.COM> when booking flights in the future due to your patience, understanding, politeness and well mannered attitude. It was GREAT doing business with you Michael and is looking forward to dealing with you in the future..
5	I would like to mention Anastassia's and Michal's names who helped me in my tough times. One of my flights in the itinerary (booked from <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com>) was cancelled and my entire journey was jeopardized. I started chatting with Michal (<http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com>) who helped me through the entire process and saved me out of my toughest and testing times. Finally I am boarding onto my next flight and have all the appreciation for the angels called Michal and Anastassia.
5	Hi! I'd been having a pretty awful time.  Luggage stolen etc trying to get home.  There was a small problem and I phoned twice as I was freaking out! Monika K and Valentin Monacu were simply great.  Fixed the problem but also were humane, funny and professional.   You guys helped  me do much and I'm thankful.  I work myself in a second language and these guys were amazing, even though my accent is a little difficult in English... So thanks again! Damian McCoy
4	"Great customer support - prompt ticket delivery (1 day later than specified in the email but that's fine), easy-to-use site.I'm giving you 3 stars because I was charged an additional 40 EUR at the airport for a large cabin bag at Wizzair that I didn't have the option to buy at your checkout page, and for this reason I feel really frustrated and expect to have some sort of compensation, as I consider this is not my fault.The rest of my experience with you was acceptable.--UPDATE 14 SEPTEMBER 2015---Reading what you've just replied makes me think you're just trying to avoid the real problem I got. How could I pay for it in advance if you didn't have any option to buy a large cabin bag at your checkout page? I didn't know Wizzair had this ""luggage"" differentiation and you didn't say anything about it at the checkout page. I really feel cheated and for this reason I changed my rating to 1. Unprofessional and I'll never book with you again.---UPDATE 15 SEPTEMBER 2015---They called me, apologized for the inconvenience and offered me a voucher as a token of apology. This made it up for the stress I had at the airport, but not fully, so the rating is increased at just 4. Thanks!"
5	"Earlier this morning I was making a booking to see my sick father and inadvertently I entered the incorrect time, (my mind was elsewhere). Anyhow, I managed to get on ""Chat"" with Petra M and after she asked me a few questions about my booking, promptly handled my issue.In this day and age it's so nice to come across such customer service. We are customers are quick to point a figure at other when things don't go right ( and 9 times out of 10 it was our own making), but in this case I can do nothing but applaud Petra M for the professional way in which she handle my issue, very timely as well."
5	Skypicker helped us so much, after TigerAir rescheduled flight for 4 hours earlier during the night and kicked us out in the morning because we were requiring another flight or refund. Skypicker reschduled flight for another airline for free, so we escaped the hooricane, we cought our connecting flight home and finaly we will not miss my good friends' s wedding. THANK YOU!
5	Couldnt do my online check in and then i called in to kiwi and a man called mohammed helped me and saved me 210 euro. ThaaaanksGood service, excellent
5	Great online support , faced few issues initially but  all issues were clarified immediately. Thank you Skypicker
5	It's the first time I book via Skypicker and haven't hit the road yet, so cannot say much about the whole experience, but must say, your live chat support is EXCELLENT :)I was facing some problem that was resolved within a few minutes by the nicest and most polite and helpful guy going by the name of Henri A. So, if your entire service is as Henri's, you'll get 5s score from me at all criteria..THANK YOU HENRI  :D
5	When searching for competitive prices for our 4 flights around S.E. Asia, the prices varied widely. With many consisting of a 10 hour wait in Vietnam, which was not even one of our destinations. I was eventually directed to <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>, price was less than half  and no need to go to Vietnam. They have sorted out everything for me, including my own mistake without fuss.The customer service is excellent, I will be using this company on our future trips.
5	Buen servicio al cliente. Muy amable y rapido el chico que me atendio, muchas gracias por todo, Juan! :)
5	Mario zarski deserves a whole lot more than my deepest and most sincerest thanks.  We were supposed to stop off in Paris for 2 days then To Venice for 2 days and after to London for 4 days but Our flight had gotten pushed back 2 days because of cancelations by the flight (not by kiwi).  If this would have happened it would have started a never ending domino effect that would have caused us to miss all the flights from here on forward . He dedicated all of his time and rerouted us to where we were able to still get to Paris for a day and follow on with our regular schedule . In my opinion he saved our trip , I was already about to quit and just go home and cut my loses but he gave me assurance that everything will be resolved and is a man of his words !  I will definitely be traveling with <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> because of the skill and guidance of people like Mario that make that company a great place to travel for.          Thank you Mario zarski!                             Sincerely,  The Martinez family!
5	I had a issue to fix with my booking your agent Tomas provided a more than excellent service and managed to fix everything for me in a matter of minutes. I wish all agents were as helpful as him. Thanks again Tomas and good luck with everything!
5	I am very glad that today i was connected with Monika K. . She is very kind and helps me a lot) I had a question about my bagage and she resolved everything very fast and easy i am glad that i save my time and gave me a very competented and fast answers. Thank you Monika K. you are great))))
5	The tickets from skypicker are usually among the first ones I check for, because they do everything for you, from reserving and helping you pay for your ticket, to online check-in.So basically, you just have to sit back and relax while others do everything for you (AMAZING feeling!).Also, when I contacted customer service, they responded immediately, and helped me understand some things about my tickets, which I really needed.All in all, I would recommend them whole-heartedly for any ticket reservation you can find with them.They're that AWESOME!
5	I am completely satisfied with the service Skypicker. I`ve spent a minimum of time and got what I was looking for at the best price. I will use it in the future and also recommend to you!)

5	One of my itinerary flights from Brussels was cancelled (due to terrorist attacks some days ago).  I contacted Skypicker and they found an alternative route for the same day.  Chat and phone contact + support was great and really responsive thanks to the professional attention provided by Juan Mena Costa.  Now time to pack and looking forward to take my flight!
5	Great assistance, and honesty to the client. Even though there was a little problem with my luggage. He advised me professionally.
5	At first I really thought it was scam but than as I continued chatting the person who helped me ( I am sorry I forgot the name) pulled out my reservation and told me to click on the link. I was planning to change the flight to different date but the price range changed a lot so I kept my ticket :smile:.I have been provided excellent customer service and wanted to thank you for that...
5	Had a lot of questions and Jan Lukasek helped me a lot with all of them
5	I had some problems with the personal details I had specified in my reservation. Pedro answered my call and gave me quick solutions to all the complications PLUS he was very very kind and thoughtful.Lovely to have people that make thing easier for their customers !!Thank you.
1	Jeffrey RivasMy wife and 8 years old got stucked in Hongkong because of a void payment that was made by kiwi. the first leg was processed but second leg of the trip was not ... The ticket was purchased at 10am of Saturday and was declined after 2 hours without verification - that was the last money that my wife and son had because they leave soon on Monday sept 5 but unfortunately despite the plead and request to have the booking reverted you had it void and refunded which made it difficult for us to raise another fund to purchase a new ticket again but because it was a weekend all they could do was wait and to date my wife and son just arrived Cayman with no money on hand but faith and resiliency that they will make it to come home .. And now we are still waiting for the refund because we borrowed money from almost all our family and friends because the ticket being bought same day is a very expensive one. Now we depend on when they will reflect in our bank account to pay off the money we borrowed.God is good all the time despite of the adversity they came home safely.My wife tried all the best she could with your customer service and All they could tell her is they processed it and they have nothing they could do even if my wife told them they dont need refund they need tickets. booking #1408277
5	ELENA WAS VERY ATTENTIVE TO MY BOOKING QUERY AND SHE WAS ABLE TO SORT OUT MY ISSUE QUICKLY.

5	We looked for a flight and found this web site that was very easy to use and comfortable.Prices was very good !Defenetly I'm going to use the web site in my next vacations!!!
3	@timleffel What are your thoughts on discount flight finders like Skypicker? <https://t.co/KE0smolWul>
5	I booked flights for 3 of us, which all went very smoothly - I was impressed then. I went today to add our passport details to the booking, and made a mistake. I emailed, had a response immediately, and had help from 3 people, Samuel Barkoci, Zuzana Hadarová and Miquel Gudayol over the next hour or so and immediately sorted! Am even more impressed now, and will definitely use again and recommend. Thank you.
5	Thank you Julia for all your help, you were extreme patient with my series of questions.
4	I'm very greatful for your support today considering the circumstance. You took really good care of us when two of our flights were canceled because of the storm. / Swedish in the US
5	Great service, quickly resolving the matter and very informative. Many thanks for your help!
5	Skypicker helped us to check in when we were late and saved us lots of money.
5	I had not received the email confirmation for the booking and Lucie K via the online chat was extremely helpful and able to resolve my query quickly and efficiently.
5	Best service so far! This review goes for Martin Carter. I have never had to speak with customer service before for airlines, and based on my situation I was very nervous. I sent an email with my concern and Within 30 minutes I was given a call! This person was the most helpful representative I have encountered with in a long time! I will endorse Skypicker because of him and I thank you so much for your knowledge, kindness and professionalism Martin Carter. You will be a true asset wherever your career takes you. Thank again Skypicker.
5	Service was great, he even called me basically in the middle of the night to help me out
5	Mario was very helpful getting us checked in to our flights.  Kiwi doesn't make it very easy for passengers not letting them check in by themselves. Luckily thanks to Mario our customer experience increased significantly. Great help.
2	First of all, we got confused with the baggage, since Sky airline (provider) offers a free 23 kg allowance, but the website only showed free cabin baggage and indicated we needed to pay extra for the stowed baggage. We booked anyway. Prompt email confirmation, good. We contacted the online chat, which was also very good. We then were emailed within an hour to say they were having difficulties booking the flight (good), and then 13 hours later we got an email to say they didn't manage to book the flight. The main reason I am annoyed about this is that the Sky airline website still offers the flight we booked, as does <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> and all the other intermediate booking agencies, so why was it not able to be booked?
5	I had online chat with the Kiwi customer service assistant Tomas L regarding my booking information, he was very helpful and polite and I didn’t have to wait long for the reply! I also like the Kiwi as they are good in keeping their customer informed via emails and text.
1	I have been trying for two days now to change my checked and carry on luggage. A few emails here and there and my answer is still not answered on how to change it or if they will change it for me. I had to call and they are still no help. I have a flight tomorrow morning and no one has helped so I most likely will be charged for extra baggage when this all could have been avoided. Very irritating!!!!!
1	My boyfriend proposed to me in Paris. The next day we are flying to Nice to celebrate our engagement and we were sorted 20 sits apart from each other. The way it's being done-we were sent an e-mail with boarding pass and sits were selected for us, without even giving us an opportunity to choose sits ourselves (it's being done day before flight). We called airlines and asked to change sits, no matter where, as long as together. Agent told us, that they are sorry, but nothing can be done, it's the way they do and that's the rule.It's not a long trip from Paris to Nice, but very special for us. Customers satiscfaction is not priority for this airline and dissorganisation is in place.
5	I have booked the tickets cheaper than directly from flight company... I was wery surprised..
5	I have mistakenly entered the wrong passport details. I used the Live Chat and was promptly assisted by Nina. Within a few minutes, she corrected it. Awesome service.

1	"We were traveling with six passengers on 02 august from AMS - UET. But on that day there was a plane on fire at DXB. So the plane rerouted to another airport ""Ras El Khaimah"". And from there we were sent back by Pegasus to Amsterdam. I called <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> they could give me new tickets. I got only 2 new tickets because we missed a week from our vacation and the other four passenger wanted their money back. So I asked the agent who I was taking too, if I would get a FULL refund.. He told me yes. Based on that I got only 2 new tickets. After the trip I contacted <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> about the case and they said they would investigate it. It would also take 20 euro for the service(?), but I agreed with this. After 2 months(!) I got a reply that I got a refund of 250 eu. The tickets were the price of 3000 euro. So I contacted them again to ask why is it so low. Al I got was ""One more time, refund is based on airline. If you do not agree with it,please contact the airline."". At first I was really happy with these new website. I was planning to use it instead of the local travel agent. But now i know, I am going back.."
5	Hello,I was helped by an agent called Dima K. who took my details and answered me within the hour.
2	I booked tickets through this company to Europe and back. On my return my Easy Jet flight was delayed in Munich for 2 hours while they fixed the captains seat belt. I ended up missing my connecting flight in London back to the US. On the Easy Jet flight I alerted them that I was missing my connection and they looked at me and shrugged their shoulders. When I arrived at London I went to the Easy Jet counter and they told me there was nothing they could do for me. I was given a piece of paper with a number to call for customer service and claims. At the same time the lady told me they were a point to point airlines and they werent responsible for my connecting flights I needed to allow 3 hours between connections. Even if there had been 3 hours I would have missed my connection, but still if thats the case then Kiwi who booked the entire package to me should know these policies between connections this is the job they do. I never even thought to check that they did there job right. Anyhow I was forced to spent another $3,000. on this day to get myself home. By the time you consider that $2,300. on new airline tickets. I needed to take a 1 1/2 hour bus ride to London Hethrow airport to catch a new plane back to Amsterdam, I had to get a hotel room for the night in Amsterdam before flying out the following morning. When I contacted Kiwi about it the said that London Gatwik airport only requires 2 hours between connections. I sent them a copy of the claim denial with Easy Jet who quoted some air traffic policy from 2008 that says that no reimbursement is required for connections less than 3 hours. I have heard nothing back now from Kiwi travel and I assume now 2 weeks later that I am s.o.l.. Heres the thing....I did nothing wrong. I was where I was advised to be at the suggested times. I had all my paperwork with me and how do they get away with stealing my money like that and not providing the service that they should? I suggest that under no circumstances anybody use this shadey company because there is no guarantee of anything but a spit in your face! Charles Franke

1	I had the bad luck to book my tickets from this site. I paid with my credit card, received a confirmation email , and it was late at night so i went to sleep. Next morning i went to my work where i had no access to my emails. About some hours later i checked my emails and i saw a second e mail that said that i had to make a phone call to the company so that they will verify my name , credit card etc. I was suprised by that , because nowhere in their site or confirmation email was earlier mentioned that i had to do this phone call. The problem was that they gave me a specific time limit that i should do that. There was also a third e mail that said that i didnt contact the company within the time limit so my booking will be cancelled and my money will be refunded in 10 working days.I called the company  immediately but the time limit had expired for about 1 hour. Our communication was bad, as i could not listen very well the advisor of kiwi on the phone because of the big noise from his other colleagues talking to other phone lines in the same office. After a long conversation, he tried to make my booking valid and he said that they would contact me in a SHORT TIME to tell me the results. I wanted a quick answer because if they rejected my booking  I was completely unsure if i would manage to find tickets in other companies as the time passed.As you can imagine,  noone ever contacted me. So I should make 2 more long phone calls during that day to let me know if my booking was valid. I also sent some messages through their web site with no result. After about 10 hours i managed to take their answer that was that my booking was not valid, and i couldnt even make the booking from the begginning because my card was not acceptable any more. They said that my money would be refunded in 10 working days. You can understand that I had an extremely stressful day with all this situation, and i also spent 25 euros for these 3  phone calls that day. My story didnt end there, as , according to kiwi, my money were supposed to be refunded in 10 days. Instead of that,  I got my money back after 40 days. So if i didnt have enough money in my card to pay for the new tickets i would be in big trouble.The good part of my story is that I booked each ticket seperately from each air company internet site and I totally saved 100 euro. The conclusion is that the booking procedure is strange, and they dont inform you from the beggining that you have to make this phone call to verify your booking. Secondly, they are expensive, thirldy, they dont answer in web site messages, so you must call them if you are in need, and you pay a lot in phone bills. They never call you back or send you an email if you have a problem , so you have to insist in contacting them in order to help you. Lastly, If you need a refund for a reason, it will take a long time to take the money back. For these reasons , i will never ever think about entering their site again.
4	Check all airline policies regarding baggages so you will not be surprised at the counter to pay extra for your baggage.
5	Thank you Sena and Lenka for you friendly help. The live chat is very good. I think the comfirmation Mail with the Travel and flight information could be more detailed. But Sena and Lenka helped me to find the missing information. Now i hope my dad will have a easy trip :-)
5	I was not sure how this site works or if it is a fraud. Talked with Jan Stepan and he explained the payment process and how to get on board. I am now calm and will use your services.
5	Delivering a comprehensive answer in a friendly manner - what else do we need ? Fully recommended !
5	Thanks for help
5	Big THANK YOU for helping to promptly cancel an incorrectly booked flight and managing the full refund! Really appreciate companies that take the extra mile to help customers with non-standard requests (I was already convinced that I've lost my money and you managed to very positively surprise). Btw. I know about the site for quite some time, but this was my first actual booking. After this experience I feel much more confident to use your site anytime in future.
5	Easy to use, no clitches and everything works as it should.Booking was confirmed immediately and no problems with the flights.Would use skypicker again - thanks!
5	I'm very happy for the service of the chat support..For me is EXCELLENT..I'm talk with a girl assistence named Melinda..Very excellent assistent!
5	I wanted to travel on Tenerife island with my girlfriend, therefore I was searching for the most suitable choice for a cheap travelling. I have been surprised by the ease of reservation and subsequent automatic check-in via internet. My experience has totally overcome my expectations.
5	At first I was unsure as I had never heard of kiwi. I was reassured when I called and had my questions answered in a timely manner.I would like to thank, Stacey M., Dariia V., Jan Lukasek, Lydie Bucilova for all their help with questions and changes in seating. I will use this site again as it was affordable.
5	I was looking to book a ticket to Colombia and had several questions. Every single time after I thought I was out of questions, I afterwards had more. Contacted them three times in total in the end. Big thanks to Irina, Daniel and Maria. You guys are great!
5	I was dealing with lady ivana vlahovic in handling some flight changes and arranging my surf board to jump on the plane with me, she was extremely helpful and replied promptly to all emails sent very happy with the service!
5	Thank you so much Skypicker! And especially Karen for your most helpful and satisfying customer service! I couldn't check in on-line (in 24h before my first of multi-destinations flights)  but there came the cavalry! The service was quickly in process and in no time I got my boarding passes! I am so grateful.Best regards

5	I was served by Radek! Was patient and very helpful to chat to! thank you will be booking with kiwi
1	We booked a flight through Skypicker because we had heard that airlines in Vietnam could not guarantee you reach a connecting flight. When we had read Skypickers guarantee, we were quite confident to book ticket from them. But when we stood in Vietnam and our flight was canceled so we didn’t reach our connecting flight and therefore had to book a new ticket for a much higher price, then their guarantee was not as they promised. The only thing we could get was a refund of the double price of the original ticket. It was not even the half of the amount we had to pay for the new ticket.My recommendation is: book your flight ticket directly from an airline that's cheaper and most of these have better guarantees than Skypicker.
5	thanking you for helping me update my details after I put the wrong name in. it was all done very quickly and without any problems.  thanks go to Olga Colenova and Daniel Merinsky.
4	Thank you, Bek. Help me modify the distinction. There is a good communication platform.
5	Very helpful and understanding! Would definately recommand this site :grinning:
5	If you have a problem, hope for Tomáš Mužík to pick up your phone. Although the online check-in system was refusing to accept both my ID and password (saying the format was wrong) dealing with Tomas was an absolutely pleasant experience. He not only did the online check-in for me, but offered to file a ticket for the tech-support to solve the issue and left me with a big smile.Thumb up!
5	A friend of mine suggested me Skypicker as the best and easiest way to book flights and now I know she was right, the website is easy and clear and Carlo B. was very fast and kind at replying to my questions!
5	It was a breeze to get my air tickets online via Skypicker. The instructions and process were very clear. I emailed to the support department to retrieve some info on my flights and the response was very prompt and detailed. Will definitely recommend Skypicker to my family and friends.
5	Got some great help from Lukas P with check in, so i didnt need to get up in the middle of the night
4	I bookt my flygt on Kiwi. Afterwords i wantet to cancel it. Tomas L. helpt me a lot and was very frindly. Hee give me al the information which i needet and aswel offerd me to do it for me. Thx a lot Silvan
4	Seth was very helpful and patient with all my questions! Thank you!
1	Has very bad support I take a ticket with a prepaid cardThe procees is normal and all finish good But after booking apear a message that i must make a verification of card (Why make a verification in a prepaid debit card i dont know)Also say that i must communicate with <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> in the next 12 hours. Ok I call them and speak with support and after little questions tell me that all its okThe next day i receive an email that say me that the booking is cancelled because i dont communicate with <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> in the last 12 hours And the money return to me in the next 10 daysI dont believe that happen this Something simple the <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> make complex
5	Tomas went beyond the call of duty in helping resolve a small issue I had. Great in this day and age to get real interaction and response from human beings!
5	I want to thank  Miquel and Petya for helping me on solving some problems with typing in  a wrong passport number! I was so worried thinking it is going to be a mess and i would have to buy a new ticket, but not! They solved everything in 10 minutea and im sooo happy! Thank you guys for such a great service!
5	I was very pleased about the effectiveness of your live chat program. Maybe the program isn't so good, maybe the service providers are the ones that makes this program look great. Jana - a professional who answers all the enquiries withing a short amount of time whilst being professional and passionate about her job. She provides exceptional service and probably she is already like a role model in her position. Thank you very much again!
5	Tomas Muzik most helpful in finding the necessary information.
5	Very good website, easy to find your perfect flight, good prices and really everything ok.Customer care experience was very good with Johana helping me solving some invoice problems.Thank you skypicker and Johana
5	responded very fast and answered all my question with good explanations!
1	In a booking, they charge my credit card 2x times. The second was coming AFTER they send the ticket and a confirmation email that payment is fully-paid and everything's OK. They even NEVER give any notification to CHARGE YOUR CREDIT CARD 250% ABOVE YOUR CREDIT LIMIT, which is the common business usually reject and auto-cancel the book.
5	Nina- a very nice and helpful lady that gave me an immediate answer regarding my booking. This was my first booking via Skypicker and Nina immediately tracked my booking and solved my issue on the spot. I hope she gets the credit she deserves :) I wish you all the best !
5	Igor, the agent that assisted me was very helpful, nice and knowledgeable person. I am very much pleased. He did his best to assist promptly and efficiently managed to get the information and the reservation done faster than usually it would take. This was my first call to kiwi and I am nicely  impressed. Thank you, Igor very much!!! :)
2	@easyJet  hi am trying to add luggage to my booking with skypicker, they won't reply help me i want to add 60kg please. Before is too late
5	Brilliant customer service! Used the online chat to amend some info, Radim was very friendly and helpful and solved my query instantly. Great job! Thanks again!
3	"BUYER BEWARE .... "",,,but as we at Skypicker know that baggage allowance is different with these two airlines we do not mention Extra Hand luggage, because it may cause a problem as for example you have experienced…."""
5	Skypicker found me cheaper tickets than other comparable websites. Everything is as simple as it could be. I also love the graphical representation of found results in the map. Communication and reminders also went very smooth.
3	heres another tip, don't use these useless skyfuckers, they will fuck your holiday for sure and deny all responsibility for their errors, make you wait a full day for a response and then want more money. Motto is-fuck skyfuckers
5	Thank you Eric for help. He talked nice and helped me very much
5	I was impressed and pleasantly surprised by the patience and understanding they had for me you were remarkable from the availability and quality of service.Team is listening to the customer and very helpful.Beautiful experience i recommend the website <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com>
5	I found a really cheap ticket from Mallorca - brussel- prague - london and back to Mallorca. The service is excellent. Really fast answer! Thank you
5	I contacted the customer service via live chat, and got Miroslava P helping me deal with my problem. She was very helpful and responded very quickly. She helped me to rebook the tickets and sent me the confirmation email straight away. Very much satisfied with the service! Best operator! reviw by John Dodd
5	When I started experiencing problems with specific Indian airlines, a call to this support group was enough to get immediate and accurate support. A special thank you to Serhii Kiian, who looked at my problem as if it was his own, and provided maximum help.
5	Easy-to-use, fast, without any problems
3	Skypicker offers flights for up to 90 percent less with a #cloud -based ticketing portal #IBM <https://t.co/UATtL3D1ba>
5	Eva was prompt to respond to me throughout our chat, and was as efficient and polite as she was a pleasure to work with, not to mention she helped me resolve my issue which was a boned headed move on my part but I was not made to feel a numpty for it... You do indeed rock Eva. Thank you kindly.Lynda.

5	I had a few questions before booking my flights and Ana patiently answered them all and helped me through the process.No problems in communicating with this company at all!
4	Had a little problem with the online check in at skypicker. I used the Live Chat and there was immediatly a guy ( Martin Carter), who helped me very friendly doing the check in. 5 minutes later i got my boarding passes via mail.. Cool! Thx!
5	That's what I posted on the 'Improve Question' and I think it works better here! Hope it's helpful, as you were for me!'I had some questions before to buy the tickets and I talked with one workers of your platform -Irina- and she really helped me a lot. She didn't mind how much time we wasted just to reply everything as good as she was able to.And also, few days ago <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> platoform send me an e-mail to let me know there was a aereal-traffic strike all over the Greek peripheria, which was so nice because I could talk before with the careers which I was flying to the next few days.So, thank you so much!'
5	This is the second time I have had issues with flights that I booked through <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com>. Issues were not related to <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com>. However, the staff at <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> were very efficient and helpful. I am very satisfied with the service and will use their service if an opportunity arises.
5	I had problems with my Booking Reservation, but Archil was very patient and helpful and in a few moments I got my answers and he resolved my problem very quickly. Very pleasent staff generally, several times I bought tickets with SkyPicker, and I never had any inconvenience.
5	My Norwegian flight was delayed for over 3 hours which caused me to miss my next flight, I contacted kiwi customer support and the guy Mario R was really helpful and fast finding me new flights to my final destination. Maybe not the fastest possible route but everything worked out fine.
1	@skypickercom customer service fail = 8 hour delay and all alternatives booked out
5	We were 3 persons having the same route, but we bought the tickets separately. And I liked the fact that they understood it and matched our seats. When possible of course :D Because they are doing the check-in online for their clients (at least at low-cost flights) immediately when it's possible.
1	If you are booking anything do not book with kiwi. Their customer service will not attempt to understand your complaint or accept general feedback and will talk at you about how they think your wrong. Kiwi booked a flight with me for spirit airlines under my phone number and address but with someone else's name. So, the passenger name was mine but the contact NAME only was someone else. This meant that I could verify my address and phone with spirit but I could not verify my name and could not make any changes to my information or add bags. I also didn't know they did this until I got to the airport because Kiwi does not send you any emails that say your contact info is not your own or that you need to make changes on their website. A reasonable and rational person will think if they need to add a bag they should do it with the airlines not with some third party booking company. So I was charged an outrageous fee for my bags because I was unable to add them online with my airlines and my airline couldn't verify who I was when I got there since they wrote someone else's name. I will never use kiwi again. Thanks for not being helpful Barbara.
5	Thanks to people who are involved into this, the one can always find the cheapest price for air tickets and get the proper service, I'm totally satisfied with the service.
5	The company is great. I needed to change my flight and their agent (Veronika) got it touch with me in less than a minute, arranged everything and was super nice. Thank you very much!
5	I sent off an email about a quiry I had the response back was very quick and efficient the correspondence was kept going ontill my issue was solved I would recommend this company to who every has worries about travel issuesThanks agin for all your help
5	Thanks Radek Pospíšil , Travel Consultant, <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> for changing detail of my flight without any fee. Someone stole my ID so I need to change it.
5	Easy booking, best price and messages before the flights. Thank you for taking such good care... Would highly recommend using <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>
4	I want to thank the team of Skypicker for having a very professional handling of my difficult file. We needed to find a solution for a flight that I booked to Zadar which had 2 connecting flights and the departure flight was cancelled. The team offered me several options and also I gave some further input. Together we found the perfect solution. The personnel I had to deal with was very professional and always did a perfect follow-up of my difficult file. Compliments to Khrystyna V., Gabriela H, Mohamed A. and Roumain R
1	They take your Money but they don't give you the ticket and it's completely impossible to get in touch with them.The flight company can't give you the ticket either because kiwi change the email address and payment information. Is this really legal???
5	it was my first time booking with Your Company.Few years earlie I was flying a lot.While booking by Internet there always was some fuss.But I tryed to book a flight to Entebbe throu another Company, andalready paid for my tiket, but the next day they canselled the bookingand returned the money. I was rather upset, but was luky to findyour Company. It turned out to be most efficient.Be as You are.Thanks and best regards,Sergey
2	I've booked a flight last week for tomorrow from Lisbon to Barcelona but by the time I've got the reservation I've noticed that the names were <http://switched.my|switched.my> surname was in my middle name.I asked the agency to change it and they told me to pay €55 which I did.but now TAP is telling me that I'm on waiting list.The call center team tells me that they are handling this subject but do They really need a week to do days? I've paid the tickets and the changing but I don't have anything. I really need your help on this.
5	I was unsure if my booking was all in order. A quick check by your co-operator mr Marius to set uws at ease. We can continue our travel without worries. Thank you for the good service.
5	I had to fly from a big capital to a lonely island in wintertime, and only one low-cost company provided direct flights at the moment, but only twice a week. So I went through many flight research websites, looking for a one-way connecting flight - I would reserve the return direct flight separately. But all they proposed me were 7 hour to overnight, extra expensive journey; I couldn&#39;t believe there wasn&#39;t nothing else. With a little googling, I came to find Skypicker, and there, magic! A connecting flight, with reasonable departing hours, a minimum waiting in between flights, a guarantee to catch the second one, and for a very nice price! So I bought it. The confirmation arrived quickly and I could arrange the rest of the journey right away; I was a little worried because I reserved through a booking website and not directly with the flying company; but everything went so smoothly, it&#39;s now my favourite flight website and I&#39;ll use it for all my future journeys!
5	Adam Jelínek has been extremely helpful in helping me resolve my issues regarding adding my full name to my ticket. I didn't realize that my middle name would be a concern until recently, and Adam is so helpful in helping me resolve this issue.
5	After realising there was an error with a booking I had made, I panicked and contacted Skypicker staff. Michaela O. responded to me and was able to help me fix the problem simply and efficiently. Her response was extremely helpful and friendly! I definitely recommend this booking company.
5	jan Lukasek was very helpful and a quick reply on the live chat
5	Kiwi were super in sorting out another flight option after Ryanair cancelled our flights due to french airtraffic control strike. Very pleased with the service and help assisted to us. Strong recommendation
5	I was impressed by your customer service... Alan was the best!!!
2	<http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> will charge you a large premium (anything from 12 to 20%) for your air tickets.  You can verify this by checking with ticket prices on the same airlines that it will use for your reservation.  If they are booking you on multiple airlines or flights, check first with those airlines separately BEFORE you confirm your booking with <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>.  You will find that if you add up those flights, the final total will be significantly cheaper than <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>. I am sure that <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> profits in this way.  So it is highly misleading when the CEO says that you can save up to 80% when booking on this website! So beware!!
5	Kind and instant response. Great service
5	I got sick and needed to get home one email to skypicker and it was all sorted. No drama. No hassle
5	Have booked through a large number of travel sites and Kiwi has been one of the best. Very friendly and personal service - you can speak to someone very easily. In my recent case I spoke with Mario R, who went the extra mile to provide lots of information and support.Great app too. All-in-all a solid choice for flights!
5	very good service. Agent Alan help me to find full detail regarding my flight. Thank you very much.
5	I just booked a trip to Ibiza from Las Vegas within 24 hours for the best price and the best service ever! I was nervous about the booking with such short notice and I spoke to ALI on live chat and he was an absolute super star!!!! He looked into my reservation and within a few minutes he helped to get my confirmation to me and answer all my questions. Thanks Kiwi & ALI for being so amazing! You need to give this employee of yours some love, he's amazing!
5	Experienced good customer service. Thank you B. Sultani! Greatly recommended
5	it's a really responsible agent, I appreciate so much on what deal with the strike of Athens airport, they help me rebook another flight to ensure I can arrive the destination. I will book the ticket by it in the long run.
5	I talked to Jana Vojtova she was very pleasant and very helpful. She did a great job in helping us out with our issues with our luggages.
5	I want to say thanks Anna for good friendly support and quick reactionI like calendar notifications from Kiwi, good prices, friendly personal page.Thank you!
5	I traveled to Vietnam and Kiwi had by far the best prices for connecting flights I could find. I received booking confirmations without delays and wouldn't hesitate in using it again.
5	Natalie at Skypicker. You're a star. You made my booking experience a pleasure instead of a task. Thank you so much for your personal input.Simon Norton
5	I loved using Kiwi to book my last few flights and have actually searched for options that allowed me to book through the site as the experience is so easy compared to other airlines/agencies.We also had a big problem where the airline had changed our flights to an earlier time at late notice meaning we would miss our connection.A few calls with customer service (in particular Adam Jelínek) and he had arranged and fixed us up with an earlier flight without us having to do anything. Was so pleased and relieved!
5	I thought I’d share how I get cheap flights when I travel. None of it is rocket science, and if you apply a few of these tips, you should be able to save yourself some money the next time you book airfare. So here we go!One of these tips that I would recommend Skypicker services.
5	It's a fantastic company. 24 hour support via chat . I didn't know that i should  supply my Passport information(  48 h before the flights on Ryanair) and i just call for support . I get a answer from a Travel Consultant : Vitalii Nikitin who was very polite and glad to help me . In 2 min. I received on my email the boarding tickets and the problem is solved.    I definitely recommend this company!
4	I am very grateful for a flexible and fast support of Martina Krénova.Having forgotten to book a check-in luggage and realizing it less than 24 hours before my flight, she was extremely helpful. Thanks to her, I can transport all necessary materials to the conference ;) Thanks a lot.
5	Customer service is excellent ! Mr Babak helped me with adding additional luggage to my flight. He was very friendly, helpful and nice. Thank you Babak/ merci. Fantastic!!!
1	"I have booked a flight using Kiwi, and had the worst experience when I tried to change the destination.I used the Help chat, talked to someone called ""Basbora"", I didn't get any clear idea whether I will be refunded or I will be paying for the whole flights again, He then said I shall receive an email, but I never received any.Now I talked again to someone called ""Lukas"" took a hell of a time to respond to anything I say, I didn't have any option except for canceling the whole flight and book it again using anything but Kiwi, I am now waiting for another email to see if I will ever get any of the 1,027 USD I already paid."
5	Great price and service.Had all my requests to travel to Malta sorted out by Eva Sloukova.Thanks for the prompt reply and sorting out the boarding passes.I look forward to using your service again.
5	Thanks(Monika) for a great support there. The live chat support was very helpful.Thanks again for clearing my confusions. :)
5	I'd like to thank kiwi's staff especially Ky, Lucie, Lurii and Abigail  for being  great customer service representatives. I had a small problem with my booking since I've changed the date of the flight, so I had the opportunity to talk to them. Honestly, they are very helpful,  Very patient and detailed. Provided me with loads of information and even links to solve my problem. It is the first time I book on <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> and I will book on no other website from now on. You are GREAT.
5	Very Good Service. Received really fast reply and solution to my issues.
1	other travel agent online always decline transaction when no limit credit card. how come? kiwi charge more than credit card limit.where your secure booking process as your tagline?
5	I was very positively surprised with the ease this was to use. I was connected to live chat with one of the employees Ajit of kiwi and he was very helpful and polite. Also I must say I didn't wait long at all till I got to speak with him. He helped me out to sort my problem within 5 minutes. I would recommend this to for easy online bookings.
5	They respond right away to any phone calls/inquiries, and always do their best to help quickly. I had the pleasure of speaking to Travel Consultant Dorota Žigová who was very helpful.
1	"***I WAS TOLD BY A SUPERVISOR THAT MY VALID PAYMENT METHOD WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED BY THEIR SECURITY TEAM AND I SHOULD USE A DIFFERENT COMPANY***I have attempted to book a flight as a gift twice now. Both times their ""security system"" declined my valid, active card of which I was able to provide all correct and appropriate information for. The reason it declined was for ""suspicious behavior"". There is nothing suspicious about a person trying to purchase a flight for somebody else. When asked to verify more information they merely required the country of purchase, the country of the flight, and my relation to the passenger. While that information may be useful, if this security system is there to ""protect my identity"" they do that by asking who i'm buying the ticket for? I could be purchasing for a homeless man to fly back to Africa but it's MY CARD AND MY INFORMATION. They do not request billing address or any other information, just my relation to the passenger.I can't use my valid card with valid information even providing ample information proving that I am who I am. I am literally just trying to purchase a flight."
5	Due to some technical issue I was only sent 4 of 6 boardingpasses.After calling customerservice, Martin Helísek, promtly send me the missing two.I've dont mind minor issues - these things happens, it's how they are solved that matters, and this was done perfectly and fast - thanks !!
5	Barbara was very helpful on the Live Chat as I tried to update my passenger information. She had an answer for each question and I was good to go by the end of the chat.
4	I had a problem with my tickets ( the airport was close ) and they solve it for me quickly and easy ... thank you very much
5	very professionals... the best...
1	Our first flight was cancelled, kiwi promised to find an alternative but they proposed something only after 7 hours!! And there were many flights available.. at the end we had to make part of our trip by train but they refused to fully rembourse the train tickets ( and they had promised they will). Terrible and arrogant service, never again!!
5	David answered me at the chat. We had a change in our flights, and I asked for a compensation. He solved my questions quickly, so I am very grateful to him. ¡Great service! I will update my review as long as we solve our issue.
5	I booked a ticket and instantly regretted my purchase as I forgot to read up on reviews about the airline until after the book..Already assuming the money was gone I let out a last battle cry in the form of an instant chat message with a CS rep named Yuriy N.Well My boy Yuriy made sure that I didn't get charged and cancelled my order, no fuss, no questions, only the humble cyber-presence of this class-A customer service rep. We should all try to be a little bit more like Yuriy. Thanks bud!
5	With less then 2 weeks before our flight over Vancouver, Toronto, Montreal and back to Denmark we discovered prices were high. We had to pay between 8-10.000 euros on most sites. Because of kiwis interval function for the departure we found flights with our dates for just 1500 Euros, which in the high season was very cheap.Only little remark was that the airlines often asked about our luggage, but we had printed the papers from Kiwi, and then everything got accepted.
5	i put the wrong email so didnt receive the confirmation message. I made a call to the hotline and the consultant named Igor did an excellent job to sort it out for me. I cannot expect more for the service. Great job!
4	This is a great site for searching fares, especially if you're flexible. They contacted each airline and changed the name on the reservations when I messed that up.
1	Just had my return flight cancelled and offered a refund that takes 7-10 days.  Really poor customer service.
5	Filip was awesome, very quick and very helpful.
1	I booked the Flight from Budapest to Barcelona, Flight W62375, 18/10/2016, but I received a e-mail saying that Flight changed for 17/10/2016, changed one day before that I booked, it is impossible. I contacted the kiwi and they told me that I have to pay if I want change for OCT 18 like before. What? I booked for OCT 18, the company change for OCT 17, and I have to pay if I dont agree with this change? ABSURD!! It was not 1 hour or 2 hours, it was ONE DAY change! I need arrive in Barcelona OCT 18, that it was I booked before and I dont have to pay for that because it was not my fault. And I already paid for the Hotel OCT 17 to OCT 18, will the company guarantee this charge?
5	I love skypicker they make me plan my trip nicely
5	It's my first time using skypicker and I will always choose Skypicker at first hand in the future. Excellent service overall but special thanks to Jiří Červenka who professionally helped me when I had questions about my booking, A big Thank you!
5	Thanks to Eugene, my flights were fixed and the process went much more smoothly! You are the man.
4	I inadvertently booked the wrong flight due to customs requirement upon entry into the US. <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> refunded my ticket in no time. They were very helpful, understanding, reactive, and available 24/7.I recommend without hesitation.
5	Both Daniela and Ondra helped me figure out how to check in and receive my boarding passes for an upcoming trip. They were the perfect mix of professional and casual. So far, after booking multiple international flights, I have been nothing but impressed with Skypicker.
1	Ayuda! alguien sabe como cancelar el vuelo antes de que me roben? he estado intentando comunicarme con ellos desde hace dos semanas y no hay respuesta, alguno de ustedes sabe que puedo hacer?
4	Today I had a problem with a double reservation in Ryanair (quite expensive ticket): one via Kiwi and one directly. As I could not solve that problem by myself I called Kiwi in Poland and a nice person named Bartłomiej Kmietek in a short time informed me that one ticket is cancelled without any costs. I am very grateful that help. I also received immediate help from a girl Aleksandra, who helped me to receive a boarding pass, which was missing. So today I could experience that the staff in Kiwi was much more friendly and helpful than in Ryanair.
5	very helpful, solved my problem in a few minutes, thanks :)
5	Thank you Anna! Great service. The live chat makes things so much easier for those without a roaming phone.
4	Dear Youssef,Thank you for your excellent service and I will appreciate your assistance during the conversation in phone
5	Had a problem with passport info in the website , Niel at the customerservice was very helpful and fixed the problem in minutes!
5	My customer representative, Tamara was very helpful and patient while I ordered my flight. I was hesitant to buy my ticket because of issues I've had with ordering online and Tamara suggested that she should wait until my ticket was purchased and confirmed. I had a great experience with her, thank you Tamara!
5	I was not expecting to get such a direct help and actually everything was sorted out! Totally recommend Skypicker : )Have a nice trip everyone!
5	Thanks a lot to Yuriy N. and the Skypicker Team. You manged to change my flight to the perfect remaining alternative in less then 30 minutes in the middle of the night. Nothing more to say, it's not possible to top this.
5	Very quick response to email inquiries including contacting flight operator to change details
3	Only discount you get here is a discount from your bank account and nothing to show for it, they will fuck up your flight for sure Guaranteed stress. Use another booking agent for peace of mind
4	its very difficult to find any e-email address where i can send the receipts of my trip. plain was very late so we missed next flight and we have to spend a night in hotel :(allso, we have to pay cabbin baggages two different times.
1	"It was all because of a flashing low price that Kiwi showed for my upcoming trip that caught my attention. But, there was one caveat. It was a hand bag only flight for an international 14 hr flight! Hmm. I'll just pack less! So I purchased the lucrative flight deal. I also downloaded the Kiwi app, but got no e-ticket until one month after the purchase. Anyhow, I was ready to board. After getting to my native land's airport, I was less than prepared for what was about to ensue. Air Asia told me that my flight to Bali via Kuala Lumpur wasn't connecting. The flights had been booked separately (something a kid would do when younger as he wouldn't know what ""connecting"" flights meant). So what did this mean? I wasn't allowed to board the plane! Because I didn't have the transit visa to transfer between terminals at KUL. Shouldn't Kiwi have given even ONE notification of this during or after booking? This is Kiwis response:""You were flights were indeed booked separately with the airlines as it is one of the ways how to provide cheaper tickets to our customers. We have an unique way how to combine flights which are not connected by the airlines so that we can get you better prices and deals.""Sounds like the most conniving thing ever. It's like buying a car for a great price but then the cost of the hidden repairs supersede the cost of the car! And that's what happened. At the airport, in my utter anxiety to reach my destination on time, I paid more ($600) for a one way ticket to Bali than the ""super unique, magically low(not really that low)"" round trip price I had paid ($440).Secondly, the customer service lady boasted:""We do not hold visa information for each nationality and country combination. So we give a general notification that a transit visa ""maybe"" needed. We are not responsible for obtaining any visas.""Wow! So you have this wonderfully unique, magical way of getting us the low prices, but you fail to factor in the cost of the transit visa (or the cost of buying another ticket in this case) in the ticket you offer? You claim to be so irresponsible that you choose disconnected flights (when connected flights are offered by those airlines!) and leave the unknown expenses to the customer? Your highly unique software makes fantastic combinations of flights but can't do the same for visas? In my 7 page E-ticket, there's only one small measly line on the last page, in the passport/visa/health section stating, ""You might need visa for your journey.""It doesn't say which leg of the flight, which destination, which airline has its flights separated, nothing. I obviously had the visa for my final destination, but isn't it Kiwi's responsibility to provide adequate information about the flights being separate and a transit visa being required? I know corporations don't really care about customers. This is a perfect example of a careless, callous company who simply cares about their bottom line at the end of the day. How annoying would it be to deal with transit visas at all of our flight connections in the future?! Well, to this booking agency, it's a way to cash in."

5	I'd like to thank Peter and especially Zuzana for the kind and prompt support. Cheers:)))
5	I just spoke to eric. I am leaving really soon and he helped me out and made my vacation much easier. Im not usually a review-kind a guy, but If you need help ask for Eric.Thank you Kiwi and Eric for making my trip easier and Better !!!!
5	Viktor helped me today with several questions. He was very patient, helpful and thorough!
4	grazie Daniele per il  preciso e puntuale aiuto!ho trovato le risposta che cercavo...........
5	Thank you very much for your work!I had some problems with my ticket to Cyprus before I found your site. Then I found the appropriate time for me and the best price for the ticket on your site, I bought it for 3 days until my departure. Thank you very much!
5	Irina, thanks for good coperation! :-)
5	About 12 hours before my flight, I was having some troubles with my baggage and wanted to purchase extra weight. I was quickly helped by Daniel on kiwi's online chat (24/7!!), who was incredibly helpful. Even with the short notice, he was able to solve my problem. Thanks Daniel!
5	Booked a family trip in summer through SkyPicker but later a situation came up and had to reschedule the departure/return dates of the flight.We booked cheap airline tickets so I was mentally prepared for the harsh terms and  fees, that is, if we are even lucky enough to reschedule. Re-fund and cancellation were out of the question.Used SkyPicker's website to manage the schedule change and the charge was of course extremely high (more than directly buying a new set of tickets). Asked customer service to see if there is anything they can do, and to my surprise, they actually did help me contact the airline and came back with a much lowered fee!My claim was initially handled by Jana Turčanová, who did not dismiss my claim, checked my reschedule record and thought the fees were indeed too high. She asked me to provide more details about the scheduled change;The claim was further completed by Kristina Blahová getting back to us with the successfully  lowered fee. I have to say the level of helpfulness was unexpected and satisfying. Thank you both for making our trip doable.
5	Let me say first off that being stuck in Kathmandu while in a dire situation is not cool! After making a mistake on my initial booking and a bit of a debarkle following shortly after, the staff at <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> we able to come through with some light. The flights were changed and everything came right.It shouldn't go without saying that without Dorota and Anton, the last piece of the puzzle wouldn't have been found, Dorota was quick to rectify some issues that remained with precision and professionalism, going above and beyond to bring both customer satisfaction and results with impressive timing. Thank you Dorota and thank you Anton for your phone expertise with getting everything sorted!
3	I sent you a refund application through your website a week ago, and I'm still waiting your response.If I can't get a refund or change my schedule, I have to rearrange my hotel appointment. My trip is coming. Please let me know what's going on!
5	I have really good experience with Kiwi, great, cheap and super fast booking! Since I had problems with communication with Cebu Pacific airlines after my flight, Kiwi helped me very quickly to solve it. Customer service agents are always super nice. Thanks god they are here!
5	Thank you Tomas Jurik for your detailed and quick handling of my issue. <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> should be proud of its employees :)
5	Was having some issues with boarding passes for a flight my sister and I were taking. Youssef was extremely helpful, understanding, and got everything taken care of for us. Thank you again!!

1	"IT MAY SEEM LIKE A DISCOUNT BOOKING AGENT, BUT YOU WILL PAY MORE IN THE LONG RUN DUE TO <http://KIWI.COM|KIWI.COM>'S INCOMPETENCE:<http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> is a website which purports to book flights for consumers, which means that they are, by the law, ""agents."" They claim to have customer support, which I'm sure works well for the majority of flights, where customers need no support. But, if you happen to be in the minority of flights, where you need customer support, GOOD LUCK WITH <http://KIWI.COM|KIWI.COM>. THEIR AGENTS ARE RUDE, SLOPPY AND UNHELPFUL.If you happen to become ill, prior to your flight, the airline is generally more than willing to provide a refund or exchange (in part to protect the rest of the passengers from catching your illness). This was my case. Through <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>, I was asked to provide a copy of my medical certificate, which I promptly did. <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> indicated that the airline was satisfied with the quality of the certificate and would process the refund WITHIN 30 BUSINESS DAYS AND THEN I WOULD HAVE TO WAIT AN ADDITIONAL 10 BUSINESS DAYS FOR <http://KIWI.COM|KIWI.COM> TO PROCESS THE REFUND ON THEIR END. I waited and waited and heard nothing. Finally, I contacted <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> and their rude customer service agents told me that the airline did not like the quality of my medical certificate, BUT THAT <http://KIWI.COM|KIWI.COM> COULD OFFER NO FURTHER DETAILS ABOUT ADDITIONAL DOCUMENTATION I NEED TO PROVIDE IN ORDER TO SATISFY THE AIRLINE. THE INCOMPETENT ""CUSTOMER SERVICE"" REPRESENTATIVE TOLD ME <http://KIWI.COM|KIWI.COM> HAS NO DUTY TO PROVIDE THIS INFORMATION AND THAT I SHOULD CALL THE AIRLINE. I called the airline, which told me that they are only able to provide this information to <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>, and will do so, only upon <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>'s request. JUST A PIECE OF ADVICE TO <http://KIWI.COM|KIWI.COM>, BEING A BOOKING AGENT MEANS YOU DO HAVE A LEGAL DUTY TO HELP YOUR CUSTOMER BY ACTING AS AN AGENT AND PROVIDING RELEVANT INFORMATION TO YOUR CUSTOMERS, FROM THE AIRLINE.Unfortunately, for <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>, this may have been their unlucky transaction. I happen to be a lawyer and I am currently considering taking this action to court, if I do not receive a refund within the next two weeks. BASED UPON THE SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF SIMILAR NEGATIVE EXPERIENCES ABOUT <http://KIWI.COM|KIWI.COM> AND THEIR PREDECESSOR <http://SKYPICKER.COM|SKYPICKER.COM>, I AM CONSIDERING FILING THIS AS A CLASS ACTION LAW SUIT.<http://KIWI.COM|KIWI.COM> STOP RIPPING CUSTOMERS OFF THROUGH UNACCEPTABLE, INATTENTIVE AND UNRESPONSIVE ""CUSTOMER SERVICE."" YOU ARE AGENTS BY THE LAW AND YOU HAVE THE LEGAL DUTY TO ACT ACCORDINGLY.* On a side note, I also suspect many of the positive reviews above and below are fraudulent and posted by agents or independent contractors of <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> *"
2	RT @JornBuhring: A startup that finds discount flight tickets 'hidden' on airline websites just launched in the US: I just book... https://…
1	I used thier company in two flights one was to Indonesia with an extra bag someone in the office forgot to mention about it that i had to pay for an extra bag by cash... Second flight from Manila to Seoul and then from Seoul to Tokyo first flight was delayed so we didint manage to catch the flight. I phoned them up for help and they said they would get us the very next flight available, we just thought that was it. Then, 2:30AM Korean time on the airport they sent me email saying that they unfortunately cannot book the said flight but they will investigate to refund €350 once its been approved by their financial department which means that i have to pay my pocket money by cash to get a ticket few hours before the flight?! I mean seriously is there any one with brain airport now is dead quiet and i have to buy ticket on my own never used them they will just leave u on the airport and then financi department will 'investigate' to give u some refund ridiculous! Totally rip off!!!
5	I love skypicker. It has made my life easier by making it simple to find cheap tickets, especially when you are flexible with dates. Found great flights at good price that other websites did not offer!
5	I booked ticket 36h before flight and was worried about my mother who needed wheelchair. Special request like need to be made at least 72h before flight. I contacted <http://KIWI.COM|KIWI.COM> assistance and they arrange everything, made sure to inform me all the time about situation. I was pleasantly surprise with care and professionalism. I never heard of them before but I will surely use them again!

5	I had a problem with my online reservation, and I tried the chat online help.  I talked with an operator, Jan Lukasek, who immediately solved the problem. It is not such usual to be so satisfied about this kind of online services.
5	I called the Helpdesk for further info concerning my baggage, upon making it to the operator, who was very kind and polite, I got my answer right away and my request was solved within few minutes after calling.Great service, thank you Ondra P. and looking forward to future flights with <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com>.
5	James helped me check in online in about 5 minutes and he made it easier than I could have imagined! Thanks James and Skypicker!

4	I had trouble getting my boarding passes for a flight this afternoon, but Dorota was very helpful in sorting it out :) She was quick to respond and put my mind at ease (and also very funny!) Thank you Dorota!

5	Great experience! Just called the hotline as we needed help checking in. We only had to wait for a few seconds before the call was answered and we were assisted in the most professional and helpful way by a kind and very service minded operator named James.
5	Just discovered super cheap last minute booking flight #free app! Download #SkyPicker and check out awesome prices! <https://t.co/4g1SRmBSWP>
5	Thank you for your help Ivana V and for your quick response on the live chat :)
5	Excellent service. I had a problem with a wrong date of birth which was quickly solved (for free) by Klara at Kiwi.They also automatically took care of check in and emailed boarding passes to me.
5	As a nascent service, I was encouraged by their guarantee which proved to be beneficial  on one of my trips booked through them.  Because of a delayed flight, they were able to arrange an alternate flight itinerary AND cover my hotel expenses for my overnight stay.  The customer service rep was very helpful and informative, especially during a stressful experience with the airlines.
5	Alex was the guy helping me in my suffering. He did so with clear instructions and answers and within 5 minutes helped with all my questions and problems. Amazing service!
5	ERIC GAVE US THE BEST SERVICE WE EVER HAD A) BY PHONEB) e-SERVICES
5	My daughter flew from Portugal to Corsica.  There were a few issues with the trip, biggest one that they got stuck at Geneva Airport as the flight to Corsica was cancelled due to bad weather. As a mother I panicked and worried and stressed, but the Skypicker staff was so friendly and understanding.  I thank every one at Skypicker who attended to my queries, and for their help and support.  They have gone the extra mile to ensure my daughter arrived safely in Corsica.  I will definately make use of their service again.
5	I had good experience with skypicker. I have to thank Anna for good assistance and friendliness.
4	I was unsure wether to use Kiwi, as there are many companies that fail to deliver. Based on Trustpilot reviews I booked and paid for the flights, got the boarding passes and had no problems.
1	I was booking flight from Kayak and it is like worst experience of my life that flight got booked by Kiwi and we were not allowed in flight as they were asking for credit card number where as we did't have kiwi credit card number. If we are booking ticket from our credit card then why same information was not provided to airlines. My family were not able to travel due to this crap and i would recommend people to not to use Kiwi crap service at all. Even to reach out to customer service you need to sit on phone for an hour or so to connect. Its totally a crap and not sure i would get refund also.Hope i will get some response here.
5	As a lifelong traveler I have come across few travel sites that have the excellent customer service, low prices and flight options that Kiwi provides. The first flight I ever booked with them required many changes due to flights delays. The customer service team provided excellent, quick and responsive help. Theydid everything they could to make sure I got to my friend's wedding in Luxembourg on time!  Thank you Kiwi.
5	I made error on my booking and didn't notice till hours before flight. Contacted customer service and they swiftly amended both of my flights and then contacted back to see if I was well. Would recommend.....
5	I booked 4 flights for 2 journeys in 1 easy transaction through sky picker. Quick and convenient. They even sent my Ryanair boarding pass a few days before I was due to fly. Would definitely use this service again.
5	A big thanks goes out to Igor in the skypicker team!!!. Igor phoned me back to advise on an issue regarding flight tickets and passport change inquiry, and he was very helpful in putting me and my partners mind at ease. My partner has recently changed her passport which means she will have a new passport number. We were worried that the two airlines which we will be flying home with would not be able to change the document (passport number) without having to charge us for changes to the original tickets and details. However, Igor contacted both airlines and they will do it free of charge once my partner gets her new passport next week. Thanks again Igor! (Steve & Helen)
5	I was having issues putting in my passport information and Naomi helped me with everything I needed and had my boarding passes sent to my email! Thanks!
5	Today i needed some help for checking online my flight, an Juan Costa was an excellent help. I couldnt do it without him. Thank you
5	I was completely lost with that online booking thing, but thanks to Eric and the great service he gave me, i was able to find my way and im finally ready to fly !! keep upo the good work.best, Kevin H
5	To be honest I was a bit skeptical about booking with Kiwi because I read some reviews online but it turns out they were actually really efficient at changing my connecting flight despite it being from two different airlines. I was very pleased and Lucie G helped me all the way.
5	Yet to make the journey but, so far, very pleased with Skypicker Service.In addition to competitive pricing, Customer Service agents have responded quickly and efficiently to additional requests.Also like the interface on their site so, assuming everything goes as planned as far as their role is concerned, I'll certainly come back to use Skypicker again.
5	Thanks for help, u are seriosly and amazing company, i will be for ever your customer.
5	Thank you Emre Tam for a wonderful customer service experience :) not many companies will reply within half an hour on a saturday but you did it!
5	Quickly find cheapest option to travel to countries, I've never been.Very understandable visualization on maps.
5	Just booked a flight just now, waiting for it to process, hope I wont get any of those complaints :) 60 mins processing? really?!
5	Extremely fast customer service. Took care of my issues immediately.
5	Had a urgent question and was quite stressed out about the booking I had made(missed a middle name from passport when booking a flight ticket). Got an answer very fast and the consultant that helped me, Karen Abrahamyan, was very nice and had fixed everything in only 1 day! Very happy with this company, and the tickets.were cheap to definitely going to buy my next trip here again!
4	It would be great if it possible all flight could change or Refund.
5	My problem was sorted in very few minutes by Miroslava, Thank you very much.
5	Today, I have experienced an amazing customer support service! Special thanks you Clariss who was very kind and helped me to change my flights in a short time!
5	Everything is taken care for you, from the minute you start looking for flights. I had one small query and very quickly Danial H had looked in to it and totally put my mind at ease. Such great customer service and a total pleasure to deal with.
5	I received perfect customer service, special thanks to Jonathan who supported me.
5	I had so many questions just a night before flying and therefore turned on the live chat for skypicker. Was greeted within a second by Erin A. All my queries were answered patiently and clearly. Thank you Erin for the help!
5	I would like to thank evryone in skypicker team they were a great help for us and hopefully our flight will be good as your service...thank you once again
5	I fly with them often and there were issues with a flight due to ATCA strikes, they informed me immediately and gave me instructions on what to do. The airline was unable to help and actually rather terrible but skypicker got in contact with me and then with them to promptly find me a flight/refund and covered the price difference. Truly amazing and helpful, thank you!
4	i had a problem with my visa and needed to change my flights and mr.zwdnak b have been a great help and waiting for my changed flights to be send to me via email . thanks skypicker
5	Really great support! And the best prices. Thank you very much!
5	Very good experience using LiveChat online supportI couldn't insert my passport details to make the online checkin because of an issue with the link in the email.Michaela O., via the live chat helped me fixing the issue very fastThanksFrancesco
1	"it's is very unpleasant service.I booked the website. but i had to cancel the flight. so i asked this situation. they said, they can't refund but change destination, passenger or date. so the next day, i requested to change destination. they said ""NO"" and then they said, you can change the passenger and date. the next day, i request to change the passenger and date again, they also said, ""NO""i can't refund and can't change anything. i just waste my time and my money.and it is very late respond.i am really disappointed and confused this situation."
1	These guys are trash. Took my money then cancelled my flight and now i wait for a refund??? Why would you sell tickets if theirs no seats?
5	Perfect service, great approach! I am definitely coming back:-)
5	Emre Tam is a very nice skypicker agent. I received good advice and it was very helpfull. Continue like this with your work !But I am not very happy because i could nt get my boarding pass for a flight with wizzair, because of a technical problem (the airport is elligible for web check in), so I am a little bit stressed for the flight.
4	I've booked through Skypicker a number of times and I've never come across any problems. Your customer service is brilliant and I always feel satisfied with any queries I've had to ask. I will definitely be using you again for future flights and have recommended you to friends. Keep up the great work and thank you.
5	The <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> travel consultant (Mila Udod) was able to make sure that my email query was addressed in its entirety in a very timely fashion, and that i was then clearly informed and able to take the appropriate actions to make my travel experience effortless on my end.Thank you =]Ben
5	I got an excellent customer care service with Serhii Kiian. He was very helpful and polite.
5	Thanks David
1	The WORST travel company I have ever dealt with. Please read:Hi,This is actually the most incompetent service I have ever received in my life, and I genuinely don't mean to be rude, but I am sorry, I am honestly embarrassed for you and the joke of the company you work for.Let me tell you why.After you guys did a horrible job with resolving my original conflict (you're a travel agency, how can you not fix the simplest of issues with a flight itinerary?), you offer me completely ridiculous options to compensate, all completely nonsense. You don't even make a special exception considering the situation, basically guaranteeing i will never use your service again and will be happy to spread the word.I don't want to waste even more of my time ranting, so let me get to the grandest point here. YOU are suggesting I pay your company €144 to change a flight which cost me €94, when the actual flight only costs €40. I am sorry, but you need be no math genius to realize how idiotic that option is, you must think I am an actual moron. THIS is your solution? This is a JOKE. Let's just show you how the math works here:Original Flight Investment: €94New Flight: €40Cost To Change: €144Option 1: Inconveniently change and pay extra fees through a so-called travel agency€94 + €144 = €238 Option 2: Forget about a moronic travel company that has zero basic math skills and lose my original investment and rebook on my own€94 + €40 = €134Do you see, now that I have literally spelled it out for you, how ridiculously stupid this suggestion is? I am not one to put people down but you must be embarrassed, how could you not be?I want this email to be forwarded to the manager of your company and I want it dealt with directly. I also want to be put in touch with the complaints department today. Otherwise, what amount can I have as a refund from this horrible experience? I would also like to know this today. Can I personally say thank you for the absolutely horrible and inconvenient experience, your incompetence in the company has caused me wasted time, stress, inconvenience. I hope your company learns from this experience, as you won't be a company for very long if you treat your customers this way. It is shameful.
5	The service offered to me was excellent, and I would always use Skypickers for booking flights in the future.  When I needed assistance to re-book the flights I was shown great patience and tolerance and it was very much appreciated.Regards.William.
5	I had a question regarding group seating and baggage requirements. Eric helped me greatly, he was very friendly, profesional and answered all my questions.Thanks a lot, The Díaz family
5	I would like to say a HUGE thank you to Samael. I contacted by instant messaging when i found out i would have an issue with my flights due to personal reasons. I felt uncomfortable about the issue but they showed they cared and strived to help me. Although i still do not know the outcome of my flights, i know that Samael has done the best for me. Thank you so much to Samael.
2	When looking to book a flight, I went onto the site of the Airflight company AIGLE AZUR and was directly driven to the Skypicker's reservation site.I didn't know this company, but fair enough, it was directed from the airline.The price given by Skypicker was surprising me since it was almost 35% cheaper than the other sites selling on line.I noted that they were asking for passport numbers of each passenger and mine which are usualy not asked for...I received later an email stating that the price was wrong and they were asking for an additional 30% and if I refused, I will be refunded on my credit card.As a matter of fact, for security reason I used a secured one-shot used card number that is given from my bank and I cannot not give my bank account number since they have my passport number...After phoning them, the person kindly concluded that I have no other option than to pay the additional amount !!I have to conclude that this company cannot be trusted and is using border edge ethical way to do business.At the end, I used another site and hope I will be refunded..I strongly recommend people buying from skypicker to double check everything before to tick .. to win in reality peanuts.
4	"Everything went very fine, from the booking to the check-in which I had to do at the airport.I must say, at first I was a little scared about the e-ticket because the idea of not having the chance to make an online check-in made the whole thing sound a bit ""scary"" to me.Everything went perfect with no hassle. Thank you!!Alessandro"
5	Eric was excellent and a great help with answering our queries. He put our minds at ease and made everything so easy. I would highly recommend Kiwi. Thanks Eric.
4	efficient chat, helpful and kind agent, Lucie Polivkova. Could have wished for one thing, which would be the last star: That it was easier to rebook tickets.
5	There was an error with entering my Full name upon booking with <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com>. The site wouldn't allow me to enter my first name + middle names due to the limitations in character input. Kiwi fixed this for me and made my day by covering for this problem. Now I have a peace of mind that my flight is confirmed and there will be no problem with boarding on the day. Excellent staff and great work taking care of consumers
4	Discount airfare site Skypicker offers travelers new ways to find cheap flights <https://t.co/uDlr8GB6cy>
4	In spite of problems I am satisfied, customer service helped me every time I needed. Nevertheless, every time I had to contact them, it was Kiwi's mistake (troubles with online check-in).
5	I was kind of nervous because I couldnt get my boarding pass, i called and i can say that i have had the most helpfull service, and i want to thank to Babak Sultani, he is great, i hope all the workers were like him!!!!
1	Please return the money to my account for canceled reservation!!!Reservation was canceled because the airline company has changed the price. I did not accept the new price and the order was canceled via your email form. You inform me that the money should be returned to the account within 10 days. The order is from August 31, 2016. The amount is not back yet althoug I sent you email reminder. If you need more details, please send me message. Linda Kovarova.
5	There is an urgent need to be in Kiev as quickly as possible. I was looking for a company that will help me do this very quickly, at the lowest price without sacrificing quality of service.I drew attention to the company <http://SkyPicker.com|SkyPicker.com> and I was not mistaken in the choice. Taking off in the morning, with two changes, in seven hours I was already in Kiev, where I met my sister.Thank you for the good work!
5	Thank you very much for all your help Natalya Petrishina. I had trouble with receiving my boarding pass and the problem solved asap, while using the online customer chat. She explained me the reason of delay and she was waiting until I could confirmed that I received all the documents needed.
1	I booked two flights with company and was told in less than 24 hours that my card couldn't be verified (although the card is mine, and in my name) and the flights were cancelled on me.  I perceive something else is going on with how they process orders.  I've never heard of a company denying payment, and I believe that if I make a report the the right trade commission, they could be investigated further.
4	Emra Tam is a clever man in that team he has solved my problem easily.Thanks a lot EMRE TAM....
1	I had to pay £75 extra at the airport as Sky Picker had not checked me in for my flights from Edinburgh to Barcelona. They are very difficult to get in contact with unless you go on Facebook to hunt them down. Not happy about having to pay twice for flights and baggage. This company needs to consider if it can seriously compete as it's communications were disorganised and misleading for me as a customer.
5	Thank you very much to Igor M. who answered all our questions promptly and efficiently through the Live Chat!
1	"Hi all, as stated in title, please don't book your next flight on Skypicker even though it is really, really cheap. Because if anything happen to you, they will not take any responsibilities, even if clearly it's their fault. And the remedy it takes in order to continue your trip, very likely will cost you more than original ticket price.Please, google keywords like ""is Skypicker reliable/legit""""Skypicker complaints"" before you finish the booking, you will find thousands of complaints about their broken service, on TripAdvisor, on Trustpilot, on Reddit. But this did not happen on other agency like Momondo or Skyscanner.I booked a flight during Easter and due to their system bug, I didn't receive the passport info request mail, and their webpage failed to show online check-in option as well, so I have to pay at the airport in order to check in, and it is quite expensive. After the vacation I called them, unfortunately, after dozens of correspondences, all I got is ""this problem is caused by your fault and ignorance"", sadly.Probably they will reply this review by some bureaucratic tones and plausible excuses like ""we have investigated your case again and based on the record in the system it's not our fault."" Well, based on the evidence that in my hand it says another way around.Again, for your joyful vacation/trip's sake, do not book on Skypicker."
5	This is the first time, I am travelling International and the level of service they provided was excellent. Be it in providing cheap flights, providing the flexibility to pay in home currency and the the patience to answer all the queries.
5	what a great service i got on the that, mayyas was able to assist me with my spanish boyfriends booking, he was a bit nervous to get stranded in madrid, but we got it all sorted,thank you
5	I would like to thank Kiwi for an incredibly kind service. I was stressed out because of tickets' confirnmation problems yesterday, but with help of very kind and gentle Tomas L. all problems were solved immediately. I had a really good experience. And next time if I face any type of problems like this I would like to recieve the exact service I got from Tomas. He is a good example!No words to say how much I appreciate what you are doing every day for your customers. Thank you!
5	Servis of this company is good experience!I No endles battle with answere machines or computers,Humen beeng you can deal with! Ineeded help with confirmation e-mail for my booking(wich I cocked up by misstiping my e-mail adres).Mario R was very quick and efectiv to sort things out for me over the chat,and,everithing was finished within 3 minuts.Helpfull,quick and efficient...Thanks Mario...
5	Vally helped me a lot, the day right before my flight. I thought it will take a lot of time to get answer for my questions but in real it only took a few minutes. thanks again, vally.
5	I have made a booking and I wanted to change, because of my business staff. There were 4 flights in my booking. Ms Teona was very willing to help me. She listened to me carefully and she contacted 3 times all the 3 flight companies to rearrange my travel. She called me furthermore more than 4 times to inform me about the going of my apply and so I had personally nothing to do. I had left all to her.I would recommend <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> and Ms Teona to all interested, because of the very kind and more than professional service.

5	I used to use skyscanner, but never again, This a great site, and the help ans support is top class. The flights are so much cheaper here, and the ability is a lot better. I woulnt go anywhere else to search,I was spending about 130euro on flights, where as the same route cost 270euros on skyscanner!I just want to mention tarama, great help over at the customer service center
5	The super fast chat with Michal helped me so much in checking in online. Thank you Michal for your support! Life is easier with this kind of chat platforms.
1	We bought five plane tickets on June 18th for a plane going from Osaka to Gimhe on September 18th. There are those among us who are unwell and while they wanted to go for the happiness of their families, we deemed the trip to be too difficult due to health issues so we tried to cancel the plane tickets and requested a refund from Peach Airlines. However, the refund was first denied because the plane is one that returns from overseas and not from Korea but then the airline seemed to be willing to supply the refund after hearing of our circumstances. However, they did not give the refund because we made the purchase through kiwi instead of making a direct purchase and they told us to contact kiwi. They avoided our requests saying that they are a third party. We never imagined that using an agent to reserve the tickets would prevent us from receiving a refund. 5 tickets amount to approximately 1.3 million won. Must we lose 1.3 million won because we used an agent? If we knew that could happen, we would not have used this site. Please do not avoid responsibility and tell us what to do. Please help us receive a refund. Help us so that we may use kiwi again.
5	The solution offered to my problem was great.
5	I had my request settled very fast and easily. I wish to thank you and Mr Martin Ch. for this B.redardsKonstantinos Chrysomallidis
4	Booked tickets quickly and easily. Had some trouble checking in but Henry Garagyozyan was on hand to help me out and resolved everything very painlessly. All good.
5	Just made my first booking with <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> I was using them more like search engine, as the system is very good and user friendly. Got in touch with representative in a minute via online chat. So no problems too.What is stopping me from using it in future? After I purchase my journeys I received an E-ticket. And from my understanding this E-ticket is to stick it in to your ...... As you cant get on plane with it. So the real ticket ( boarding pass ) will come within 24h ( in my case ) or as I been told it depends on airline companies ( so possibility for longer waiting time ) . I was flying with budged airline company called Ryanair. If I was buying my ticket on official website I will get my ticket ( boarding pass ) after I enter my passport details and no waiting. So thanks to Kiwi costumer service Alina, they managed to do it ASAP so I got it in like 5min. I am lastminute traveler, and using kiwi for finding best prices to travel. Its just this unknown time of waiting for boarding pass is kinda a step back from using Kiwi to buy them. If I buy a ticket in evening for a flight next day morning I want to have a good sleep knowing im ready, and leaving minimum chances for error. Im still rate company with 5star, its very good if you plan your journey more in advance, and hoping they will have some changes in future to get us ( lastminute travelers ) on board too.
5	I'm flying from Copenhagen to Timisoara next week and I had to check in online as I'm flying with Ryanair. However, I misplaced one digit from my ID number and submitted it wrong. I called customer service immediatelly and was connected to Angelika, who helped me out. She said it wasn't a problem to fix the number and promised it would be done within two hours' time at most, but she would try to be quicker. During the whole conversation she spoke excellent English and was very helpful and kind, you could tell by her voice she was smiling. She had this cheerful tone that is very rare in customer service anywhere these days.I called her at around 15:00, by the time I checked my e-mail at home a couple of minutes ago (20:00), I saw she had sent me an e-mail with my fixed bookings at 17:03 - kudos for being so precise!I will definitely use <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> again - I'm very satisfied and your customer service was top-notch.

5	Thank you so much for checking all my flights for me and going above and beyond to help me fix any issues I might have not forseen. You're a star! :)
5	Great costumer service. Easy to get in contact with an agent. I was lucky to get in contact with Tamara, she answered all my questions and gave me the information I needed.Cheers!
5	First time and unintentially I entered the system. Time was running out and I had not made any reservation for flight at middle of the midnight. Finally I found the sky picker and made an reservation for early flight in the morning. I am thankful to sky picker.
1	"DO NOT USE .. disgusting!  i bought 2 airline tickets, they immediately took my money.  they were unable to honour the fare at the price at time of my booking and tried to make me pay a ridiculous amount to cover the ""new fare"" price.i even suggested a change in date to work in within my budget but even this seemed too difficult.now i have to wait 10 days for my refund.  i have used many 3rd party sites to book flights and this has NEVER happened to me before.goodbye skypicker."
5	I needed to book very important flight for my business partner within less than 18 hours. The reservation was quick and easy, but I was very nervous about delayed booking confirmation. Luckily I got connected to a guy named Viktor from customer service, who quickly understood my situation and swiftly proceeded the booking for me, as it has been the very last seat in the plane. Truly saved my life.
5	Great service! Buying is easy and convenient, cheaper tickets. Support responded very quickly (I wrote in an online chat).
5	Thank you selorm.Correspondence is very good.I can't speak English but selorm is kindly correspondence.If you can not speak English,no problem!Thank you very much!
4	I called Kiwi because while changing a flight i ran into a glitch where I couldn't confirm the flight change. I called Eric who was extremely helpful - he confirmed he would be able to confirmThe flight manually from their end and that it would be a 0$ flight change fee as stated on the flight change page. A few hours later I got an email explaining that the flight change should not have been $0, that it was a glitch. I called back and explained that Eric had confirmed it would be no charge. Kiwi Was honest about the mistake and owned it, and I was not charged anything to change the flight. Eric was true to his word and the communication and accountability at Kiwi was superbly demonstrated. I am a happy customer and have respect for a company that assesses individual situations to see what actually happened before just jumping to conclusions. Kiwi and Eric thank you for taking the time and care to assess my situation.

5	Great customer service from Eric Ropars.
1	I had bought a ticket from Denpasar to Guangzhou with a stop in Surabaya and Kuala Lumpur on the way. I had my one flight from Denpasar to Surabaya cancelled with 2 weeks notice, so I had to buy a new ticket - theferore wasting money. They offered me a flight the day before to Surabaya, which would have resultet in me having to stay a night there waiting for the next flight, which I did not want. They also offered me money for a hotel (up to 50 EUR) in Denpasar on the 2 of May..., and not in Surabaya, which would have been where I would have had to stay for the night...All a very confusing experience, and a big waste of money from my side.
5	I came across kiwi online and i found out kiwi was a good place to book a light. I had challenges though, missed my flight, asked for refund, was mad at kiwi as half of the fee was made available for refund. But i met an amazing kiwi agent named Maria who is kinda new but she's exceptionally good and nice, she's customer oriented, attended to me in a welcoming manner, so empathetic and tried to explain to me how a refund process is done, she cleared all the biased mind i got about kiwi cos i like kiwi. I enjoyed my time with her while she attended to my request. Despite the challenge i faced initially, i still booked another flight with them and it was awesome. If I'm traveling again, i will still choose kiwi.
5	Oga was great!! Helped me allot when I had a problem with my ticket.  Thanks
5	This is my review of assistance by very helpful agent Tomáš Mužík. As this is my first time making use of <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> online service, Tomáš was extremely patient and sorted out my problems efficiently and relayed my fears about online booking with a new service provider. Thanks Tomáš for making my online reservation a smooth and enjoyable customer experience.
5	I had forgotten to add my middle name onto my booking for an international flight and wrote <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> about. In just a glimps I got an email from Jolana / <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com>, about her contacting the airlines and having my middle name added!! Since I get very frustrated online with researching or whatelse also.. the www. can often be a big pain! I would have probably destroyed my computer through frustration on getting it solved.. So thank you very much Jolana.!
5	I talked to a girl  Named lenka she was kind professional and very nice she helped me to checked in. I was late to give my passport number so she helped me thank you very much again Lenka.
4	Trés bon service, les consultants ils répond au demandes assez vite que possible. Je vous remercie, Ondra P pour votre aide avec mon e-ticket
4	Thanks to Miss Sasha Lukianenko for her immediate response to an issue I faced with changing my booking the day before the flight!
5	ordered a one way ticket from Praia via Lisbon to Copenhagen and requested a window seat, two days later i get a mail telling me i have got windowseat on first row. amazing and smooth
5	Skypicker is probably one of the best sites I have used to purchase tickets flying to the Caribbean. Great prices and quick responses with reservations. I really recommend them for their ticket prices!!!!
5	Like the title says they offer pretty good rates, & good online tech support too. Alice W. was very informative and helpful!
5	Quick and professional customer support team. Thanks to Eleonora, Veronika, Bartolomiej and David.
5	I contacted the company using their online chat about an error about the nationality showing up in my ticket, and they contacted the all the airlines for me within an hour, and free of charge! Their Travel Consultant, Patrik Pivoda, helped my out during this process and was very kind and quick in his response. I highly recommend this service! Their customer service is excellent and their fares are very competive.

5	"@skypickercom ""Convenience"" is not the problem. Re-checking my bags cost me not 25, not 50, but 75 more dollars in bag fees. #NotInformed"
5	Pretty good service, and they've got cheap flights that may be hard to find on your own. 24/7 online customer support. I spoke with Lucia today, and she was really helpful and informed me about potential visa issues that may occur. Anyway, I'm really looking forward to this trip!
5	Best customer support in the whole wide world....Gracias Jonathan por tu tiempo y atencion....Good up the good work Skypicker
5	Miroslava P is very available and nice and helpful, we helped us to solve our problem right away
5	Loved this service! Easy to use, tickets and boarding passes were sent to email timely, and the costumer service is brilliant! I asked for invoices and they were given to me very briefly!
3	Your reply indicates yet again your complete INCOMPETENCE.  The airline in question DO allow golf clubs to be added.  You issued various e tickets and in requesting the addition of the golf bags you've obviously only quoted one e ticket no. to the airline.  I have no receipt as I did it on line direct with the airline.  Look at my booking and you will see I paid the airline direct 225SAR.  Send me a refund please.
5	The agent (Elsa C.) was very kind and helpful, she was able to solve the problem quick and with little details since I couldn't find my confirmation number. Very effective and very satisfied!
5	Babak is very kind and helpful.
5	I love how on the ball this company is. I needed to request my golf clubs to be sent with me to a location and back which involved 5 flights and they got back to me by phone to ask me about them. Their customer relations are also always impeccable!
5	Best customers service l of my life and special thanks to anastasia and sabina thanks girls
4	I attempted to book a particular flight on line. After many hours grappling with computers  things didn't work out.  I spoke to Jana Zdechovanova.  She listened, understood the problems and said.  'I will do my best to sort this out.' She did exactly that.  Thank you.I might add that it was hard to get to the point where i could actually speak to someone...'contact us '  wasn't as easy as I would have wished.
5	Everything as ordered. Very cool searching enigine and flight combinations - I will use it furthermore!Thanks for enabling us a great experience in Iceland!
5	Skypicker customer service is awesome. I think the best employee of month is Phana)) Thank you for your easy and fast service to all of us
5	Very helpful and kind attention. Problem solved !
5	I called Skypicker because there was a problem with my boarding pass for a flight I am going to take (it did not get sent in time, they probably forgot to attach it to the email, as I had the other boarding pass attached to the email I received [ I have a flight stop ] ). The conclusion is Mr Luis Silva was very kind and solved the problem within minutes ! Everybody is alright now, happy new year !
2	Site is not working in Chrome mobile browser, had to use Safari instead. Reservation itself was smooth, payment and communication aswell. Now comes the bad part. Skypicker for some reason does checkin for you without even asking you, which is the stupidest thing I experienced in a long time. First of all, you cant check in yourself and manage your seating, not that big deal though. Second reason is that in case you are transfering to connecting flyight, you are not able to send your luggage all the way to the final destination, even though the flights are operated by the same airline, causing you to leave transit area, pick up the luggage and go send it again to the checkin area, spending hour or more for no reason. In case less then two and half hours in between my flights, I woudnt have made it. Site has potential, although in the current state I definitelly do not recommend.
5	very helpful and the person who spoke whit me was able to answer all my questions and fixed my problem
5	So I messed up my booking. Booked the wrong dates for departure and did as any young travel would do, panic. I promptly phoned kiwi and they promised to get back to me with in 4 hours. After 3 hours I got a little edgy as you would after hearing so many horrible sortries of people being screwed over by travel companies. I opened up the chat and began speaking to Patrik. He instantly put me at ease and told me everything that was going on. There had been technical difficulties reaching Ryanair and so they hadn't been able to contact them. After answering a few questions and providing great answers to do with the grace system and moving dates. He promised to phone me back in an hour to confirm how best to move the flight. Patrik called me back latter and we made the change in 5 miniutes. Very well done thankyou.
5	The service at Kiwi is great! They already helped me when I had some problems with my e-mail and today Sara J did a great job with my passport change! We've booked 4 tickets with Kiwi and Sara contacted all the different airlines to figured out if we had to pay for the change. Everything was fixed within 5 minutes, and received later on an email that we didn't had to pay. Thanks a lot!
5	Professional support give by Ira. I am happy to discover kiwi. com . Simple the BestThe staffe Ira was fantastic prompt and abble to resolve my issue.thanks a lot
1	******FRAUDULENT COMPANY*******DO NOT BOOK FLIGHTS THROUGH SKYPICKER! Don't let that poorly designed bird let you think this is a friendly, trustworthy company. It's shady and they will steal your money. Everyone I know who has booked through Buttpicker has been ripped off. SCAM. SCAM. SCAM.
1	Is very good nd Tatiana k is kid person thanks a lot Tatiana k
4	I have booked an international flight, they gave me complete information, prompt assitance both by phone and email, a smooth and easy booking process.
4	Skypicker was easy to use and the cheapest site to book my flights from Hong Kong to Sydney. They did all the check ins for me too, making it easy for me too.The only point of improvement would be receiving the itinerary earlier than the day of the flight.
5	My flight was delayed and I was not going to take my conection flight, so I had to buy another flight as I needed to arrive that day home. I booked my flight with another company and they pay back my money of this second flight I bought. Customer service was very efficient and helpful.
5	Really friendly and helpful customer services adviser on the phone. He did a great job in helping me book a seat on the plane. A pleasure to deal with!
5	I didn't receive my Board Pass. I had written to agent (Puput) on online chat. He had checked me booking number and sent for me my Board Pass one more time. It have taken near 2 minutes. Very quick service!I will continue to use KIWI service.Thank you KIWI and thank you Puput!
5	I am completely satisfied with the service of Leonardo. What a professional customer service very helpful! . Awesome company!
5	Thank you customer service for helping me out with my enquiry about how to add checked baggage.. Really appreciated.. thanks again..Ora..
5	Had a quick and efficient chat with Anastassia, who was able to answer all my questions and resolved the issues I'd had.  Quick and easy website for bookings and good customer service.
5	Thanks for helping me manage my reservation, Yuriy N!
5	I had a great experience. Was hesitant to book through them since it was an unknown site to me, but every interaction I had was prompt and very helpful. I had to change some details on my booking, and customer service not only responded quickly to my request but also wrote periodic updates to let me know the status. I'll definitely use them again, as I spend about half of what I would have from other travel sites.
5	Booking was easy and the chat contact (Sanja) answered all my questions. Vacation will be in a few weeks, I hope all goes fine.
5	It's my first time using Skypicker so a bit doubtful of its efficiency at whether its a legit travel agent even.I have queries with my travel and the customer agent Enri was so efficient in the service he provided. I don't have much time organising as my work is so demanding so it was really helpful to have this kind of support. Thank you.
5	It's so easy to book your flight and navigate threw the optionsDefiantly recommended :)
1	I flew with Vietjet Air, My flight got a time change. Vietjet sended Kiwi a notification about the time change but Kiwi didnt notified us with any information. This happened 2 out of 3 flights and Kiwi didnt let us know which made us almost missed out connection flight, we luckily made it with some miracle with 10 min. Contacted Kiwi and they gave us a compensation for a meal of 10 dollar after been chatting with them for 1 whole hour and made some phonecalls (phone calls in vietnam/abroad costs alot) First and Last time I flew with Kiwi. Im actually very angry and irritated at kiwi how they handled everything. Sure they have sometimes  good prices, but if you need in help of assistent, you wont get any! The kiwi guarantee is all poor and doesnt help you anything. Pay a little more and you get much better customer service and help. Stop waste your time and money on kiwi. I wasted alot of money and time for calling around and chatting, just to get some real information. Unprofssional!!
1	I have just been through a very unsatisfactory experience with Skypicker.  We booked a flight from JFK to Milan and within hours started to get phone calls and emails saying they needed our passport numbers and expiration dates, telling us that  the booking could not be completed without them.  We have traveled a great deal and never have we been asked to supply this information and we were not going to give this private information out over the phone or email, so became suspicious of the whole transaction.  It sounded to us like a scam and we lost trust in the organization.I understand after the fact that this information was needed to facilitate online checkin for one of the airlines we would be flying and if the phone and email communications had asked to go the the Skypicker website, access our booking, click on the Manage Your Booking tab and enter the passport information there we would have understood.After telling us that the booking could not be completed without the passport information as soon as we talked about canceling the transaction the booking was very quickly completed.We will not be using the services of Skypicker now or ever again.
5	Jakub helped me with late online check in through the chat. Extremely helpful person! Will use <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> again.
5	I contacted a live chat support, and was communicating with Katerina, she solved my problem and answered all my questions :) I would highly recommend the company because of the quality of additional services and also by simple booking process.
1	DO NOT BOOK THROUGH SKYPICKERS!!I don't even know where to start... Skypickers have a guarantee on their website that they will re-route you AT NOT COST where there is a flight cancellation. The day before I was to leave to Bali my flight was cancelled. This was my experience with skypickers: Call 1: he didn't believe that my flight was cancelled despite my insistence and referring him to the website where it said cancelled. He said he'll have to call the airline and call back. He didn't call back. Call 2: she said that there is no way to re-book and she'll have to try to call the airline for a refund and would call back. I said the flights were really expensive now and she should really read her policy. She didn't call back. Call 3: they said they can re book and that I needed not worry and that they will send through some options. They still insisted that I'll have to be charged the difference. Call 4: they send through options overnight and I replied with a preferred. They said they will send the itinerary within 20 mins. No itinerary sent. Call 5: they said they were working on the itinerary but would have to change some flights. It was now about 2 hours before I had to leave for the airport. (By the way they had finally accepted they had to pay for the change after I had to copy the terms and conditions into an email and send it to them. Call 6: it was now about an hour before I had to leave to the airport and they still hadn't sent the itinerary. Call 7: they told me not to worry even though I said I still hadn't received anything and I had to just go to the airport. I went to the airport and there was no record of any booking .Call 8: When I finally got to the airport they said they had to change my second leg flight from a one hour direct to a 5 hour indirect. And that I needed not worry because the 'booking team' were finalising. At the same time, the airline was telling me that they'd have to close the flight soon and i'd miss it. I was very worried. The airline recommended I go to the travel agent in the airport to book a flight myself. I went to get a quote and called back to see if Skypickers could cover it. Call 9: Skypickers said that I really should just keep calm and that I will be on the flight soon. It then occurred to me that they hadn't considered the time difference between Czech Republic and here. When I told them that the flight was closed they didn't believe me. They said that they would call back in 5 with an update on the ticket. Call 10: not return call, I phoned again just when the airline said they had recieved a booking. It was 15 mins after the flight had officially closed. I had to sprint through the terminal and just made it. I heard from the travel agent that Garuda are nice in leaving flights open, many would simply close it. NEVER BOOKING WITH THEM AGAIN. Improvements: - there is no way to speak to the same operator. You have to re-explain the situation every time. - they don't respond to emails. - the Australian number on their website didn't connect, I had to call the Czech one through skype. - I feel so rude saying this (especially as I've tried to learn Czech before) but the language of some of the assistants really wasn't up to scratch. I had to re-explain so many times. - the assistants had no knowledge of the terms and conditions. - many empty promises, mainly 'I will call you back'. I had the distinct impression that many couldn't solve the problem so tried to get me off the phone asap.
5	Had to cancel my reservation, and Kiwi did everything that they could to make sure that I got reimbursed. Serhii Kiian took care of my reservation with prompt, courteous customer service.
5	We had some issues with check-in, and called <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> for help. We reached Mariya Potello, and she was beyond helpful! She checked us in, at no additional cost, and send our boarding passes directly to us by mail.Thank You!
5	I used the website 2 times to book a flight. It works very well in terms of search, currency, languages, and information is clear.Sometimes even If we dont know where to go, the possibility of choosing anywhere at anytime is very interesting.The invoice was sent automatically and the confirmation took around 2 hours. I received Boarding Pass one week before my trips, they made check-in for me.It was great service. I totally recommend.
5	Oga was very very helpful, made my day 100% better!!Complications with calling since i'm in spain right now and cant call the number, oga helped me update and put in my passport info and emailed me all my necessary information!I am so relieved and satisifed, amazing team!
5	Thank you so much for your time and help. Very accomodating customer service, from chat room to support e-mail.Thank you Mohammed, Lorena, Lucie and AnastasiiaNow I know where to book everytime I travel.
5	Thanks to customer dpt for changing my name for free :)
5	Was a huge fan of @skypickercom until today. They show cheap prices but this is an illusion when checkin out... <https://t.co/UyTvrgbjI3>
1	I booked a flight for 200$ on kiwi's website, and got a confirmation email right away saying that my ticket will be issued in the next 4 hours. shortly after I got an email from kiwi saying I need to call to confirm my payment for security reasons. So I called and gave them all the details they asked for in order to process my payment. The woman on the phone told me the security office will open in a few hours and they can issue my ticket then. The next morning I still never received my ticket so I called again and this time the woman said the security office only opens the next day so now I need to wait another day in order to get  my ticket! The next day I got an email saying the price of the ticket has increased by $60+!!! What a bunch of scammers!!!! STAY AWAY!
4	I had some difficulties with the website and its lack of transparancy when it came to booking allocated seating.  Kristina Blahova at the online help centre went out of her way to get me the information I needed.She was exceptionally helpful - an excellent representative for <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>
5	Skypickers platform provides an easy search and booking process for flights from and to several locations. I found their price comparism to be very helpful and money-saving. Their Check-in service (if available from airline) and deliverance of boarding passes and other information was very convenient and worked well. It has become my favourite flight searching service!
5	It was my first time to book a flight on <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> so I was quite worried about the procedure and not so sure whether my reservation was done correctly. The instant chat was so useful and most of all, the fast and kind reply from Dominika(I'm sorry if I spelled wrong your name...) helped me a lot. Now I feel relieved with my reservation thanks to your service.
4	Overall skypicker did a good job communicating. When I first booked I did not have passport details for my companion. They sent emails asking me to update the details with a link. The link did not work so I disregarded them figuring I could just provide details at the airport. However, afraid of possibly being charged for having to provide details with the airline at the airport, I decided to email skypicker about 12 hours before my flight. Martin Carter promptly provided assistance within an hour of receiving my email. I appreciate his support and the personal aspect. However, I hope in the future skypicker can resolve the issue with the link that did not allow me to update passenger details.
5	Kristina Blahová helped me a lot today.I had some problemes to fullfill the missing information because i wasn't able to do anything. So i used the chat service and told Kristina my problem. She was so kind and answered my question with patience (yes i was so nervous and i am sure my english was a disaster haha)I gave her all the information she needed an she did the online check in.Thank you so much again :) You helped me a lot!
5	I talked with Romana!!! She was so polite and helpful!Thank you for excellent service! :)
4	I booked my flights from Hong Kong to the Philippines + domestic flights within the Philippines through Skypicker and was absolutely satisfied with the outcome.My journey went well without any obstacles. So I can recommend Skypicker. However I had grown quite skeptical first because I read so many negative reviews on the company's service in advance.To avoid wrong expectations: I think it is important to understand that Skypicker might not be able to forsee all the complications that could arise with getting to connecting flights.If you want to fly with such cheap tariffs as offered by Skypicker - then it is important to do your own research at home: From where does the connecting flight depart? How far away are the different terminals from each other? What is the traffic situation in the worst case going to be like?Even with the best preparation there still remains a certain risk - for example in case of flight rescheduling. You have to be willing to take this risk even if it might mean you end up purchasing a new ticket.At all times I kept these things at the back of my head and thus was able to appreciate the service that Skypicker could offer me - and got lucky paying a lot less than I normally would have.
5	great attention of Noah from the skypicker team, like always, a very good and fast job, thanks !!
1	Tried booking a ticket for my friend and I today 5 TIMES, filling out all the info and everything, in the end we couldn't do anything for 3 hours and we called the customer service team 4 times each and they were SUPER unhelpful. First they told me to download Google Chrome, then they told me that they do not have a supervisor that I can talk to (after the 3rd time I called) then they told me that it's probably my bank, it wasn't, we tried 2 different banks and 3 different cards. Now I found another affordable flight for this weekend but I am scared to book it (if I even am able to) because of all the bad reviews, I dont want to lose my money. I dont know what to say...
5	Great customer service at the live chat. I spoke to Michal who was really helpful. Good experience.
5	I had a bunch of questions and used <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com>'s online chat support feature.  Alan was super helpful!  Haven't flown with them yet but I'm looking forward to it.
4	-Book flights: Quick and easy-Had a doubt with the invoice: Chat customer service agent Tomáš Mužík was really helpful and replied to my messages quickly.So far first experience with this service and seems great.
5	Servizio veloce e impeccabile, un ringraziamento a Leo e Michele, che si sono occupati della mia richiesta portandola a termine con chiarezza e competenza.
3	@skypickercom  is it possible for a weblink to your livechat
5	Great service! Really fast response! Thanks Archie!
5	I had a flight booked to Malaga and it's taking off in two days, I tried adding my passport details to the system for an online check-in but it seemed to face a problem, so I called Customer Support and Barbara answered the phone.from the start I was welcomed by a very pleasant character, she asked me for some details in order to find my booking, and she just solved everything within a 4 min phone call!!!! I won't say that I travel all the time, but I do book several flights within the year, this has been the best experience in a while now and Barbara made it very easy!!Even her wishes to have a great time in Spain at the end was one of the details that make a difference!!!Thank you again Barbara for your help today!!!!
5	For some reason my fly for 31 January from Bucharest to milano and milano to Lisbon i didn't get eny confirmation nr and was no possible to do the check in..i got in contact on chat with agent Tamara..she was a big help for me..very prompt .in a few minutes she sort out everything..thank u very much Tamara ..keep going with the good work..
1	I asked for 40 kilos added for the trip Mel-Kul-Han. And after 1 week, skypicker gave me 120 kilos added for the route Mel-Kul but only 20 kilos for Kul-Han. Such a ridiculous thing!
5	I had some issues with boarding passes but the online assistant Saskia really helped me and cleared the situation. Thanks
5	Had a problem to change nationality and that was quicky managed by them. No stress needed! Defenitly Will use with this company again!
5	It all started when I realized I had put the wrong date for my return trip from Sweden to Malta. And of course I saw this after I paid the whole trip and got the confirmation to my e-mail.. I went to shock, thought that this will end up me buying a whole new ticket for the return trip. Then I saw that skypicker has a live chat. I contacted them and got great service from the staff, especially Olga. She took my problem on her plate and promised to get back to me when she knew more. A couple of hours later I received an e-mail, where I was offered new flights for the date I was planning in the beginning. At an very small extra cost of 9 euros. Yeah, thats nothing, even less so when you realize that I had put the return date to september 30th, and I was supposed to but it to april 30th. And it's april 6th now, so less than 4 weeks ahead. I could not be more happier with the service, the live chat and the staff. They solved the problem in no time and basically my mistake cost me nothing. Also a special thanks to Martin Carter Smehlik, with whom I had very pleasant e-mail conversation about this case and who made sure everything worked out fine in the end. Thanks guys, you made more than my day! :)
1	Im still stucked in África My flight was for february 8And i go to the airport as usual 2 hours before my flightTunis to charles de gaulle And they tell me that my flight was registered for the 7 so they didnt let me boardMy printed ticket says for the 8 of february  i lost my flight  kiwi didnt respond so i  lost my connection Charles de Gulle LAX  they. Affected me so much i had this trip planned since 2months agoIm stucked in África with no money because they stole my wallet and iPhone Worst company ever if i could i would sue them I dony know how i Will go back yo América they still want to charge me for changing my ticket
5	My flight was cancelled and I needed to change my flight. Via chat with Neil on Kiwi website I was able to solve this issue within a few minutes! Great service and I surely recommend it.
5	Not only did Marketa provide friendly and professional service, but she helped solve a unique problem in an efficient manner! I would definitely use Skypicker again!
5	I had a problem with my online check in and Yulia helped me out by giving me specific directions on how to solve the matter.She was very polite and helpful.Thank you Yulia.
5	Great customer service! Had an issue with my online check in but special agent Issis (via online chat) was all over it :)
5	Thanks a lot to Kira K., who helped us to change the flight data for non-refundable tikets! We had only a few hours to do this, but she was so quick in calls between us and airline that together we made it!
5	Great service - professional, quick, and not just a template that goes out to everyone with a query but very much personalised emails dealing with the issue. Thanks to Miquel and the rest of the Kiwi team!
4	It is a company to trust it once and then for ever!
2	Booked a flight to Cuba, after 12 hours got notification it has been refunded due technical reason, spoken with 3 different agent (everybody very good, only positive note). Each of agent provide a different reason: 1st you did not put your passport number and it might be the reason of the delay for the operation. 2nd technical issue with air company, 3rd and last the price of the flight it is not the same as the air company provided (400 euro against 900 euro). <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> got my money so i should be offered to another flight or another option, they just gave me back the money without a good explanation. I chosen the option: bank transfer in 3-5 days, and i paid with my local currency. of course i have been refunded with Euro ( i will lose a lot of money with exchange rate) and with the option 10 days.At the end of the story i lost money,time and the company did not offer a solution. Only customer care was fine.Never again with your company
5	The staff was very helpful as I was dealing with some minor but important complications. Specifically, Olga, Kristina and Petra were efficient and helpful. This is also true of the other staff that handled this reservation.
5	very helpful and excellent communication :)
5	Just had a live chat from Radek. The response was fast. Thanks.
1	My rights as a customer should be protected since there is no logical reason one should have to travel up country when one is going down and there were direct flights available
5	I spoke to Erik today and he was very helpful in explaining me various services offered by <http://Kiwi.Com|Kiwi.Com>. I had some issues with baggage booking for my flight in India and he got all the information for me. It was my very first experience of  using this web site and I must say it wa the most pleasant one especially people like Erik are there.
5	My birthday and passport expiration date was corrected immediately. Andrii G. handled it well. Thanks Skypicker for your fast approach and easy access to customer service. Two thumbs up.
4	yesterday  booked an e-ticket and after paying realized  had misunderstood the contact section.  Thanks to your website I was able to contact the service line and Bogden there was extremely helpful in amending my ticket and expeditating it to me.   I look forward to my trip nbow.
5	They have a nicely designed website where all the information for the booking is clearly visible. They followed up my booking to ensure I didn't fall into any of Ryanairs extra fees traps.
1	This is by far the worse way to purchase a flight. I purchased a return flight for them coming home from Cabo. They way they presented the ticket was as if it was a connecting flight. I didn't find out it was two separate flights until I tried to pay for a checked bag. They told me I would have to pay for 1 checked bag two times. I was so upset. Not to mention when you email them they take almost 2-3 days to respond to you. They told me to print my boarding passes early but they never sent them early for me to print. It was just to much of a hassle. They were not accommodating in any type of way at all. Every chance I get I will tell people if they see them as where the deal for a flight is being purchased through DONT BUY IT! Beware and read between the lines. I will never purchase anything from them again
3	For those who are not in the 1K club... <https://t.co/hW3Y6sl4Cr>
2	I booked flights in the morning shortly before 9am (exactly one day prior to departure). I got my booking number shortly after with a notification that I will receive confirmation with E-tickets within 4 hours. After 4-5hours, I received a message that there are some technical problems and it would take longer.After sending emails later around 5pm (8 hours later), I never received any answers. I figured that there is an online chat available which I used to contact an Agent. The Agent was nice and helpful. However, after waiting for 11hours I got a message saying that my booking will not go through and my flights got cancelled! Isn't that great to receive such message 12 hours before your actual flight?!If at least I would have known that the booking won't go through, they could have let me know during the day so I would manage to book another flight in the morning- now it is too late!
5	She answered all my questions and was very kind.
5	I'd recommend KIWI to everyone, Excellent service, fast reply. I had a great experience with them today with Radek P. , he helped me in a very organized way. He provided me with accurate and detailed options in a short time.I really appreciate his help.Thanks Kiwi, and Thanks Radek!
1	NEVER ever book through SkyPicker, as they are very capable of spoiling your holidays and make you lose money, ONLY because of their money-driven and unethical practices.Below is WHY. I booked a multi-city trip in Europe through SkyPicker which included three different airlines. 1. The E-ticket received quoted PNRs - when I try to retrieve bookings from respective airlines, they say either the email address or the PNR is not valid. For my Visa applications, I needed ticket from airlines directly, which I could not obtain from the airlines websites, due to unethical practices at Skypicker.This has already resulted in loss of 150 GBPS already and our Visas got rejected once.  Also, the process is still on so am still not sure about the fate of my trip and how much more money will I lose more, because of wrong information provided b y SkyPicker2. When tried contacting SkyPicker on phone, they didn't seem to help at all. They kept  saying that  they will arrange an email from airline in 1 day (even when I was at visa center and needed it immediately) - today it is the 3rd day but no signs of any email, so obviously they are not bothered.3. When I emailed them with my requests and gravity of the situation, they seem to have taken it for fun. Later they reply with screenshots of my booking. For heaven's sake, who in this professional world, provides screenshots - is that even legally accepted by Consulates?4. When I try and email them again, I have had no response for the 3rd day now when I need it by tomorrow.5. Apparently in my case, different journeys on the same ticket were booked with different contact details and not with my email and contact addresses. Some places they used their emails like 'booking at skypicker dot com' and at some places they used their employees personal details. When I try to use them on airlines Website, they do not take into consideration and say the bookings are invalid.6. This will also mean, I would not be able to Online Check-in for these journeys and the airlines would not accept my booking details provided by SkyPicker.7. Also, The e-ticket i received from SkyPicker said 7 Kgs/person which is a plain LIE as these airlines allowed 10, 10 and 8 Kgs respectively. So the individual airlines would allow you a more weight, but SkyPicker think you shouldn't carry them, why on earth?NEVER book through SkyPicker. Once they have had the money, they are not bothered to serve you.Skypicker - as a start-up you could have tried to be a less disappointing for people who have paid for and used your services. Thank you.
5	I made mistake by entering wrong name for ticket reservation. The travel consultant from <http://Skypicker.com|Skypicker.com> had arranged the correction with three airlines promptly and free of charge. To sum up I think I got a good deal with Skypicker and had great support from their team.
5	Thanks for your perfect cooperation, swift solution and amazing guarantee of my connecting flights, that would (without  your help) cost me thousands of USD. You´ve saved my holiday.
5	Great Customer service by Elena and Yuriy N. Asked for an update in Birth date (reflected wrongly) and its handed promptly. Will review more after my trip :)
5	Just received a perfect service from Eva Sloukova in the chat support. Than really made my day:) Thanks a lot Eva:)

4	Hope, that also Norwegian's checking time shold be 24 h.
1	Booked a ticket that requires you to pay for your baggage. Kiwi's fee for baggage is $10 more so I waited to pay for it until after I purchased thinking I could purchase directly through the airline. Now I can't do that, and after the purchase, Kiwi charges $50. To speak to a customer service representative at Kiwi on the phone is not an option. They don't answer the call center line (I've been on hold two separate times for 45 minutes without reaching anyone), and their online chat service just says review the FAQ page. No one can help you if you book through Kiwi so if you do so make sure you purchase everything you need up front, otherwise the cheap fees aren't worth the headache.
1	Had an awful experience with Kiwi. They made an error with the date of our return flight and then refused to take responsibility for it or truly assist in fixing the error. They left us high and dry and told us we had to deal with it. Communication and customer service was awful and they were slow to process things. Very unreliable. Still waiting for an offer of compensation for all the fees and charges it took us to correct their mistake!

5	I was wondering if the tickets i booked is confirmed? and the payment was already deducted from my credit card, since then i got to talk online with this staff : Sofia K.she was very helpful and nice, thank you very much.
5	No hassle: one search, one payment, 8 tickets, automatic check-in. Will use the service again!
5	Really good CS, no waiting time and precise answers
5	I had a problem with the refund.She helped me.Thank you very very much, Youlim Son.Thank you for your kindness :)
5	Id like to congratulate to Mr. Oliver Dlouhy for having such great members in his team!Tomas Krivanek, Martin Mikeš, Martin Lauer and Veronika Smidova are true professionals!They helped me alot by solving all of my problems in a moment!Such exceptional work guys!
1	I accidentally made a booking with wrong date.. within 5 minutes I realised and contacted customer services to cancel was told they would contact the airlines.. 24hrs later apparently they have not been able to contact easy jet and fly be .. sorry do not believe this puts me out of cancellation time.  I know it's my fault the mistake but if you expect me to believe that anything was actioned I'm sorry I can contact either of those company's so why can't you ??
3	@skypickercom Can we get that infographics even smaller?
5	I had an instant message conversation with Anna T. who was very courteous and helpful with information. She made the airline change a wrong surname for free.All in all though, it was a very good conversation.
5	Really good prices. Easy but powerful UI. Recommending everyone I know.
5	Wonderful service in locating my booking and changing flight details with no hassle whatsoever.
5	Very good experience! One of my flights was cancelled so I contacted the live chat and got to write with an agent called Viktor - he was very helpfull and positive and booked me a new flight in no time! My warmest recommendations!
5	I just spoke to Josef because I hadn't received my booking confirmation and he was super helpful and really pleasant to talk to!
5	best online airfare booking process I have ever done
5	My first time booking tickets on skypicker,and not be the last time, sanja was very helpful today,thanks!
5	"Had an excellent chat with ""Neil"" from Kiwi(dot)com.  Very helpful, very friendly, and very quick.  It's my first time using this company for booking and so far I'm impressed."
5	I still have to fly so I might change my review but for now, the booking process was perfect and the customer support is one of the best I had online. Thank you again for your first class answers
5	Thank goodness they had an online chat service. Martin Carter helped me with entering my passport information and checked in, basically saving my life

5	The waiting time was a little bit too long, but the customer service by Dariia Shokha was perfect. She understood my request and helped me in what I wanted to know. Thank you.
5	I want to give Roman a big hug! I really appreciate what he and his team did for my wife, her sister and my young kids, they were on there way back from Thailand the original flight was cancelled Roman took care of us during this extreamly stressful situation. I was in Canada, Vancouver. He would call me to update me on the progress and what was being done. He was easy to talk too, he was calm and understanding, he would always call me when he said he would. It was probably the best counter service in my life. They went above and beyond and did their best in spite of a really difficult situation, Roman and your team, thank you from the bottom of my heart! I know you have a difficult job, but I appreciate how well you do it. I will not forget!
5	Reply was fast, information was accurate and helpful. I felt reassured and safe. Thank you
5	Thanks to Eric who helped me to change a mistake in my ticket. He did it fast and he was patient to my requirements.Now ready to go!Thanks Eric

5	Amazing customer support. I had a lot of trouble with flights in the Philippines and the help I received via the Life Chat was very timely, very competent and very friendly.
5	I had the best experience with Alice W. She was so helpful and easy to chat with. My questions were all answered and she updated a mistake i made while booking. I'm grateful for her help and amazed at how great the customer service was for a booking company. I highly recommend Kiwi and their services and extremely satisfied with my experience.
3	Thank you Neil for having solved my problem of my email to correction. Thank you very much.

5	Fast and easy help filling in my boking information for traveling to London and Fuerteventura. Chatted with excellent and helpful Lucie F.Christine Falk
1	I made a booking for the wrong date online. Called Kiwi customer service right away. However, I was told that despite calling right away, the booking could not be cancelled free of charge. However, within 24 hours it could be amended free of charge, only paying a potential flight ticket price difference. I then asked to book the originally desired flight 4 days later. I was sent a link to pay an additional 109,- euro first and promised the booking would be made right away after receiving the money. I did pay by credit card immediately.  However, after not receiving a confirmation email or anything back by the next morning, after calling again, I was told the booking had not been made so far yet despite having received the money - and the desired (and additionally paid for) flight was no longer available. I was offered an alternative another day later for just 76,- euro more (instead of the paid extra 109,- euro) and was promised a guaranteed refund of 33,- Euro, to which I agreed. Yet, once again, no booking by Kiwi was made by the next morning.After calling and chatting again with customer service over and over again for literally hours, I was eventually sent a confirmation for the flight - no word about a refund anymore. However, more than two weeks later, the promised refund has not been paid. I have tried everything: write emails, ask for call backs, chat. Kiwi is silent and will not get back to me. They are just keeping the balance I was told I would receice back. So instead of paying 76,- euro for the flight I originally wanted, I ended up paying 195,- euro (one way / in Europe). Seems like a nice way to make money. This amateur and criminal service is scandalous. I have never experienced that a company just doesn't keep to what they say they will do - and just not get back to me despite asking over email, chat, phone. Stay away from this company. Booking a regular flight might work. But if you need to get a hold of their customer service and any changes need to be made, DO NOT wire any money before receiving a confirmation. Otherwise, you are not only likely to loose money, yet you will never hear back from Kiwi again. Ever. I'm considering to file a lawsuit now if I don't hear back by next week after numerous further contact attempts from my side.
1	"Hi all, please don't book your next flight on Skypicker even though it is really, really cheap. Because if anything happen to you, they will not take any responsibilities, even if clearly it's their fault. And the remedy it takes in order to continue your trip, very likely will cost you more than original ticket price.      Please, google keywords like ""is Skypicker reliable/legit""""Skypicker complaints"" before you finish the booking, you will find thousands of complaints about their broken service, on TripAdvisor, on Trustpilot, on Reddit. But this did not happen on other agency like Momondo or Skyscanner.      I booked a flight during Easter and due to their system bug, I didn't receive the passport info request mail, and their webpage failed to show online check-in option as well, so I have to pay at the airport in order to check in, and it is quite expensive. After the vacation I called them, unfortunately, after dozens of correspondences, all I got is ""this problem is caused by your fault and ignorance"", sadly.        Probably they will reply this review by some bureaucratic tones and plausible excuses like ""we have investigated your case again and based on the record in the system it's not our fault."" Well, based on the evidence that in my hand it says another way around.        Again, for your joyful vacation/trip's sake, do not book on Skypicker."
5	I asked for help in the chat,, and Tomas U helped me a lot and i´ve got anser and help very fast, GOOD SERVICE
5	All of my flight experiences with you have been amazing! I no longer use any other websites to book my flights. Thank you for keeping the prices low and my flight experiences awesome.
5	Was a little nervous, because it  was my first booking. Puput's help was great! Thanx
1	Terrible service, False reassurances while stranded sleepless at the airport. Unable to book me on any alternative flight after 8 hours. Constantly told it will be finalised but in the end a 2 hour stopover = 2400 out of pocket. Never again
5	Well, there are information that need to be filled in manage booking section but i cannot find those fields where  I can input those and here is customer service agent named Miroslav helped me with my concerns. This is my first time to book a flight through your agency so an assistance like this is very convinient and helpful to newbie customers like me.
5	I put into the reservation field for check-in accidently a wrong number. I used the online support function and although it was midnight, Elena Sh. answered my question immediately.
5	I had the pleasure of working with a lovely young woman named Dorota, who was extremely friendly and helped me find the perfect flight after my original flight was delayed. Great experience, thanks for the help, Dorota!
5	Leonardo in particular and the company in general have been very helpful in dealing with our flights
3	@skypickercom tickets cost 606+ 2900+ 8hours stranded at KL =3500.
5	We forgot to enter passport details and Kiwi Support Team was very friendly and helpfull. They answered all our question and made sure that we got tickets before finish the call.
5	Fast and professional...
1	Inbooked dates from lima to bogota on the 4th of feb and filled in aly personally details went to the check screen amd my dates had changed. I changed them back to what i wanted and made sure 100% they were correct. I hit buy to tickets. I printed them off tryed to check my luggage in and your plane is not today mr hitchins i was turned away at midnight iContacted kiwi and was told it was my fault and that i was stranded at the air port having to pay for my nights in colombia i havent made nor would they change my flights Hands down the most useless company i will never use them again and would beg any one not to either as they have they habe flipped my trip on its head
1	@skypickercom false reassurances. Told not to book another flight. 8 hour delay stranded at the airport = all flights booked out
5	I really like the way to book the flights easily. Everything was OK, I prefer online checkIn that I could do. Everything for people without previous experiences with booking, good emailing etc.
5	First time user but will be back
5	So this is the first time we are using <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>. It always is a bit complicated to get everything out right away, so we had quite some questions and Radek, a brilliant guy from Czeck Republic really helped us out a lot! Thankkks once again!
4	I missed out regading non luggage policy but the support manage to save the day. Mr. Varvara. RThank you
5	KIWI CHAT HELPI simply needed to add boarding credentials in order to ensure an early check-in for my flight. Little did I know the 72 hour window before my flight had run out.  Hence, the page option for entering my information was closed but, Lukas provided excellent customer service through 'chat help'.  Made me feel secure in knowing it is was safe to share my credential.  Thank you for all of your help and information. I would only come back for people like Lukas whom provide fast professional service.
5	Thank you very much Clara very kind person ..
5	I needed help checking in for my flights this weekend and Yurii was a great help. He answered all my questions quickly and efficiently. Thanks Yurri!!!!!!!! Thanks Alan!!!!! @emily

5	Really good experience with Kiwi.!  Needed flight options quickly and without fuss , kiwi delivered just what I needed.  I will use for every flight I take now and will recommend to my Company, Freinds and family.
5	I just had a great chat with Eleonora at Skypicker. I had entered wrong passport information for my daughter. I used the chat and Eleonora helped me in a very friendly way to change the information. It is always great to experience good and friendly service when I do errors - like here! Problem solved!
5	Thanks Irina Selezneva for your help in our flight refound, and your understanding along all the conversation :)
4	The chat is very easy and you get quick respons. They really want you to be pleased
4	I need to request the support from kiwi comgreat answer, quickly and precise for their operator, mr Alan WhitfieldI resolve my problems in 2 minutes, really helpful im so grateful
5	My first booking experience with Kiwi. After booking, I wanted to make changes to my reservation because I was missing some info abou the passport ID when I made it, and Ali was very helpful, and changed it for me.
5	I was worried in the beginning because my flight combined Wizz Air, and Ryanair, two low-cost airlines that don't cooperate. But I was surprised at how well this worked out. Skypicker even checks you in, and sends you your boarding cards! Great Service, Would use again!
5	the customer service online chat support staff is good. Jonathan :+1::skin-tone-5:
5	Thank you very much to Lois Sylvia . I bought by mistake for the wrong date and  this problem was solve within 1 hour . I am very happy with the company ...will do business again for sure ...
5	Alexandra Y was extremely helpful in fixing some issues with my passport info. She even called me back a few minutes after just to double check all my information was right as she had found a few more discrepancies. You guys have a great customer representative in your hands and you should be delighted to have her in your Kiwi team. Give her a raise!
5	best agent ever. after no sleep, tons of snow and cancellations of flights it was a pleasure to speak with Tom who was super helpful, found alternatives to get me home and he was a friendly real person. plus the company did a good job in taking responsibility for problems of no ones fault. thank you!
4	I have found Kiwi one of the most easiest and pleasant agencies. I have to praise Eric from customer services in particular for his professionalism and bubblyness. He made dealing with my query so easy and straightforward.Thank you Eric!
4	It's my first time buying tickets with <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>, so when there wasn't any confirmation of my flight I got a little nervous. It's a good thing Kiwi also sends SMS with a booking number: when I reached a help agent, he could  feasily fix my problem with the number he got. It turned out I misprinted my email adress. Big thanks to Patrick for being helpful and attentive and for figuring my mistake out pretty quick!
4	I have had a good information throw Katerina G, that resolved very well all my questions
5	Booking process is simple and the options are great. Prices in your local currency helps a lot. Recommended!
5	I never do reviews, but I do use them to make sound decisions. There is no better way to get advise than from someone who has used a product or service in which you are interested in.I can sincerely say Eric at <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> went over and above in answering every question I gave him, I'm very thankful that I landed him on the help line. I'm basing my review of 5 stars on his knowledge, personality, transparency and understanding of my situation.the prices were great from <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> on my flight to Larnaca, but the assistance i received was uncanny.Erick, I hope you find yourself in seeing this review; thank you!Cheers from Canada,M
5	Very helpful customer service. Everything as expected
5	Very good service! Agent Bek gave us quick help :D
5	Natalya, was a very helpfully and kind I a costumer service  .
5	Had a problem with my passport and they helped me right away.
5	Hello!I would love to share my experience with SKYPICKER, specially to Katerina who has done her best to help me with the on line chat.First i found a great deal from Milan to Gran Canaria, and after a week i decided to add a suitcase buit i was worried for the extra amount i needed to pay, i contact someone on line and a lovely staff call Katerina did her best to help me and at the end i had all sorted spending half of what i would have paid at the airport. Katerina has been really profetional and kind to send me all documents in few hours.I think from now one i will be buying all my tickets in the futur with this company and will also recomend to family and friends.Thank you Katerina!Kind regardsShana
5	Ms Angelika helped a lot, gave sufficient explanations. Very good contact
4	good servie with very cheap prices for flight. they are making a connection flight from 2 seprate low-cost flight  and the prices are low.
5	I was having some problems with checking in online because I had forgotten to fill them in myself. Even though it was my mistake, the live chat agent, Jan, was extremely helpful and did her job quickly and efficiently. She was very polite and it really made me feel less troubled by my problems.Although <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> provides solutions for cheap flights, I felt like I had first class customer service. This really made my day!
5	thank you for solving my problem immediately, I had very nice and helpful person to talk to...

5	I had a problem in my reservation due to the fact that my passport number was no t there and the link to update it had expired. Assistant Katerina on live chat was extremely efficient in solving this issue that would put me in a queue for the check in and possibly paying extra fees. It was the first time i needed costumer support and im very impressed
5	Very easy to Book the best Flyer to your destination.
4	Greg helped me with my seat on a plane.Thank you Greg.
4	Though long transfer waiting, it was a cheap and good solution for my last minute booking. I reccomend this to others!
5	Prompt reply from Martin Carter.  Very efficient with answers and excellent follow up. Thank you
5	I’m a frequent plane passenger and I had many occasions when I was confused by the reservation and purchase process. With Skypicker, the experience was smooth and it came somewhat natural. I bot three tickets for me and to colleagues for a business trip but realized only afterword’s that I need three invoices instead of one. Greg from the costumer care service proved to be of real help, he engaged in solving this issue, was responsive and uncared my matter to the point. With certainty, i”l become a stable client.
5	perfect customer service in live chat
5	Very well served, I got good and nice staff, very good company, thanks Zdenka B
5	I was helped nicely by Jonathan Ronald Muller Eghan when I had some questions about the flight to Budapest I am going to!
5	Thanks Martin Carter for fast comunication. When I flew with Czech Airlines from Copenhagen, they wanted extra money for luggage (which I had paid). When i came back he help me with everything and I got my money back.I used this page 4 times and every time without problem - international and local flights.
5	A very good experience. Elshames Elghawi  was a really helpful and nice with my questions and helping me check in.
5	Excellent service and the live chat agent was really helpful. Thumbs up
1	The customer service does not even deserve that name!worst ever!we are currently waiting to be rebooked since our flight was cancelled.which in itself can happen... But i expect solutins as a customer.have been waiting for 8,5hours!!!now and had to call several times and still no result.our initial flight was supposed to leave in 8hours.... Need to be on time due to a connecting flight.Its nearly midnight and we are really pissed off!!never again!!!
5	Everything was perfect, thank you, I recomend skypicker 100%
5	I am really thank with Dominika, the girl who help me with my problem, she literally made my day by fixing my issue. Thank you very much, i will keep booking with you.
4	RT @hairproduction1: Looking for cheap flights? Site offers new way to find discounted fares <https://t.co/NDLmetZlCc>
1	You cannot cancel your flight, and if you want to reschedule fee will be actually more expensive than buying new tickets all alone. Never use this service, don't support people making money out of nothing.
5	Special thanks to Valery G. from Chat Service for quick help with additional insurance for my next trip
5	Thank you to Jan for great help me.
5	Easy to use. great customer service and even better savings! Thanks for a great flight?
4	"My boyfriend and I booked our flights from Romania to Portugal through Skypicker. The price was the best on the market considering we booked 2 months before our trip. We had 1 stop on the way and few days before departure we received a phone call from Skypicker telling us that one flight operator canceled the flight for our way back home. In 2 days we received several options to change our flight and Skypicker provided an ""on the spot"" update for each availablity of flights. The customer service was very involved to solve our issue.I would recommend Skypicker because they can handle the hard work if the flight operator decides to cancel one of the flights few days before your trip and also for the affordable prices :-)"
5	I´d like to give special thanks to Mr. Peter Barsony a Mrs. Lucie Bresova who saved us from difficult situation when we missed a flight at the airport in Palma de Mallorca. The communication was excellent, they quickly find for us another best sollution (new flight), and saved us time and money as well. Thank you so much!
5	This is the second time I am using Skypicker and I fint it very convenient! Cheap and easy.. Had some questions about online check-in, and Tomas Krivanek was very helpful over the online chat. He checked me in so I didn't have to do anything else than provide him with the details he needed. Will definitely use Skypicker again, and recommend it to my friends.
3	Hidden cheap flights indeed, quote you a cheap price and then fuck it up so you pay twice and then they blame you for it . Their English is appalling and all the good reviews they get are what they post themselves
5	Excellent customer services! Easy, quickly, thank you very much !!!!
5	It is not my first experience I used <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>. I started to communicate with the company on pre-booking level. The agent from live-chat advised me in different kind of question: which airline is better to travel with, what are the luggage restrictions, check-in times etc. In general, it was easy to reach them and get an answer. Many thanks to Mr. Michal H. with a resolving of my concerns, I had a great trip to Estonia without any stress.Keep doing your job well, guys! Hope to travel with you again in the closest time.
5	I had to get in contact with the customer service, due to a typing mistake that i did when I was registering my travel documents on my boarding pass. I did not wait in line for more than 10 seconds before i reached one of the agents called Ila. She immediately took action and contacted the flight company, who corrected the mistake. 20 minutes later she got back to me and told me that everything was fine and that the mistake was corrected.What a great service.Thanks to Ila and Kiwi!
5	Thank you Kira for helping. You give fast information and good service 10/10 perfect!!
5	First time user of <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>, and it's been a terrific experience so far. Easy navigation on the website, very user-friendly. When I had a couple questions concerning a possible flight change and seat assignments, I took to their 24/7 online chat to get some quick answers. Jan and Mohammed were extremely helpful in getting me the info I was looking for and were a pleasure talking with. These two deserve a raise! 10/10 from my end.
5	Very responsive, good arrangement and coordinaton!
5	Hello, I had good service attention of Juan Costa, he could solve all my doubts. Nice to have people to help in real time about the booking flights.
5	Mr. Viktor really helped me in the briefing
4	Very helpful in making booking and make life much easier. Special thanks to Ms. Yulia Y for her great help. I would recommend it to my family & friends.
5	thanks james for helping me with the luggage inquiry !
2	"""A startup that finds discount flight tickets 'hidden' on airline websites just launched in the US"" <https://t.co/Cq6UNfDycp>"
5	i'm very pleased with the help they provided me, it was fast and efficient.
5	In fact, this is an excellent location and offers a very upscale its employees and people services people are very professional in dealing also want to thank Alsid.jonathan who continue with me quickly solve the problem.
4	I've used Skypicker a couple of times and have had no problem.  Today, I noticed that I reserved my flight from the wrong airport and gave Skypicker a call.  My analyst, Anna Alaxinova, was great!  She answered my question, checked me in for my flight and even contacted the airline to verify the fee to pay for my checked baggage.  She was even able to call be on Skype! Ha...I've never had that service before.  My experience with Anna was a 5; I give Skypicker a 4 because I was unable to find the add checked baggage info when I originally booked the flight.
5	"I often pay full price from the airline companies to avoid ""bargain"" deals on websites like Expedia, <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>, Travelocity etc. The main reason being that I can't stand the customer service hurdles you deal with after you book. You may save X amount of cash but if you make a mistake, it's a hassle to fix anything at these large corporations. With <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>, however, I was very surprised at how kind and ""human"" customer service was. When I called the support line to change a ticket, I wasn't put on hold for 20 minutes but spoke to a polite, calm agent who let me know they'll change the ticket and get back to me. Sure, it took several hours for my agents to sort out the best deals but somehow this felt reassuring - I could tell that I had a real person fixing my very real booking problems.<http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> is as good as the big guys but takes care of you like a small, personal agency. You won me over! Thank you Olesya, Petra & Alina!"
5	Thank you, Karen, for checking me in on a Saturday morning! Have an excellent weekend.
5	Easy and smooth reservation. Everything went fine. I was travelling with hand luggage only, so, in a specific flight, I received a boarding pass by email (Norwegian company), and didn´t need to make the check in. Other flights I needed, but showing the passport was enough.
1	We have booked a flight from Bristol - Croatia, Pula with a lay over in Rome.We arrive in Rome to be told that the connecting flight to Pula, Rome and the airport informs us that this flight does not exist?! Vueling had stopped the Rome-Pula route prior to us even booking the flights with you!Now our selves we have managed to get another flight to Split 5 hours away from where we are staying and the flight is also delayed by 6hours!!!We have called your customer service and they said they would call back with a solution and they still haven't!!Worst company ever
5	I wanted to book a flight on <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> and your awesome agent, Mr Radim was very helpful. lets emphasize that Your web-site has some great , features, for example how to search flight via radius search, which is very useful.Good job company & blondie
5	I would like to thank both Pavel Fridich and Sanja Denkovic for his and her help and assistance. The courier changed my flight itinerary to my destination, and both took out time in order for me to find the best solution and deal on what I wanted. Thank you for you're help, I'll be sure to use Skypicker again in my future travels.I would highly recommend Skypicker to others, I have booked with them several times in the past and never had any issues. They are quick and efficient with the information and service they provide to the customer, they make sure it's informative as possible so the customer is kept up to date with what is happening.Once again a big thank you to the Skypicker team.
5	I had written wrong email on my booking sent a email to them and they changed it in matter of minutes!Great service!
5	Morning,Had an issue with being unable to enter details of travel id. and subsequently no receipt of boarding pass.  Marius sorted us out efficiently and now we are ready to fly.Thanks Marius
5	I wasn't able to get on my flight because a visa wasn't release on time, so i asked help at the live chat on <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> and Stan, the member of staff who helped me with my problem, was very helpful and we went through the whole procedure together. Very impressed!
1	"Made one mistake when booking the flight a few hours ago (because of their poor ""review your flight"" system) and after a long wait I have been told to change my error it will cost me the same amount of money as the flight. Insulting. Flight was only booked recently and is not for several months. Do not use this company. They do not care. I have also checked on the website of the actual airline and their flights are cheaper. I wish I had never come across this website."
1	Our trip started very badly, as for bad weather conditions our flight Doha Kuala lumpur was diverted to Singapore, stayed in Singapore 4 hours  and flew back to Kuala Lumpur as the weather conditions had bettered.
5	I had a problem with my flight but Jana took care of it immediately . i am really grateful !!!
5	My boyfriend and I just spent over an hour speaking to Kristyna N. on instant message. She was extremely helpful and patient, as we were asking many questions, and was always able to answer them for us. She also helped us arrange seats for our upcoming flights so we were sitting next to each other. Overall, we were thoroughly impressed with her and the help she gave, as well as her friendliness. Would definitely recommend this company to anyone, if all the employees are as good as Kristyna!
5	Very good services. I have added a checked baggage by the chat of skypicker.Serious, patient, and very Quick. I recommand this companyThank you ^^
5	I forgot to add all my data into <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> platform, and I was in the airport without boarding pass.Serhiy from <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> solved everything in 10 minutes, without stress and worries.THX!
5	I've had some trouble to understand what was the document number and i made a mistake, Erin A. helps me to figure it out with efficiency and he called the airline companies to repair the mistake. Before, I wanted to add a registered luggage and there was a mistake on the website with the price and Anastasia F. corrected the mistake and checked the price to correct it and give me the right one. Pauline
5	Lukas Janecka helped me enter my travel document information after I was unable to do so on the website and got a mail saying I was too late already. Quick and clear instructions  made the experience easier than expected.Good service 5/5
5	Keep calm and go to fly with Skypicker!
4	I was booking the China Airlines + WestJet flight from New Delhi to Saskatoon and was very unsure about the baggage allowance. Elsa C. not only helped me with sorting this out but did so in a very professional and prompt manner. She shared the airline baggage information links and also pointed me to the baggage button that I could use on Kiwi.Great service , excellent first impression of Kiwi.
4	Really easy and customer-friendly site to book flights. Especially handy that they also show you flights that leave from airports in the neighborhood so you can definitely find the cheapest flight.After my booking, I had some questions and was surprised with the friendliness of my contact person through the chat, Tomas Jurk. He helped me out and answered all my questions in a timely, professional manner. Cannot wait to actually leave on my trip now :) !
5	When I booked another flight with Kiwi recently I made a mistake. I chose the wrong airport, but I noticed that only after I had cleared my payment. When I realized my mistake I called Kiwi on the phone to tell them about the problem. The person on the phone, Mr. Serhii Kiian was very friendly and helpful. Hel helped me cancel my booking and getting back my money.Thank you! I will use Kiwi again in the future.Stefan

5	I must say that I faced some problems with typing in my ID details into the system which were important for the online boarding. But after contacting the KIWI customer support, I got a reply and help for my problem which saved me a lot of money. Even got a response on a Sunday instantly. Special thanks to VeronikaB. and Dmitry M.
5	I didnt expect such an execellent service from an online agent! Eric and David P were extremely helpfull and kind. They showed full understanding to the dificult situation that I got into, and they guided me through till I found an alternative flight. Really appreciated their efforts and willingness to help.

5	Eric very nice man,fast and good help me
4	"The status of flights was not reflected in the ""manage my booking"" and there was no email informing the cancellation of one of my flights. The hotline of them was held for ages. However, the customer service representative I had on their online live chat, Nina Kasapwas, very helpful and provided all information I needed to know. Really thankful to her assistance:) So just find a wifi hotspot and go on with live chat. They can help!"
5	We had Cebu Pacific change flight times which would have caused us to miss an international interconnecting flight. <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> staff negotiated with the airline (who for no reason rescheduled the flight) and had us re-booked on a flight which suited our schedule. As a long time traveler and my first time using <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> I am very impressed with the level of customer service and professionalism. Thank you.
4	Needed some help with my booking and she fixed it up for me straight away! Thanks Aura! :)

5	I had some online check-in problem, but I got quickly help from Alex at the livechat, only 5-10 minutes. Very fast and kind help.
5	We booked a trip to Austria with Skypicker.  Everything went smoothly with the booking and flight, and contacting their customer service got us quick answers to our questions.
5	These people are awe . Quality service and agent Petr  was helpful and so kind and friendly.. I like them ..
5	A massive thank you to David.. he solved my issue in a very short time. I was very annoyed as i couldn't view the confirmation email which proved i booked some tickets. My email address, the one  I used for the booking wasn't working anymore so I asked him to change it for me so I could add my passport info and receive my boarding pass. Thank you very much again David.
5	24/7 staff was very fast, accurate and friendly. Thank you very much.
5	Thank you for helping me with the seat allocation for my flight! Viktor was the best support that I could find!Best Regards and a Happy New Year!Robert
5	Had a few questions regarding a flight coming up, used the Live chat and got very quick and useful information from Michaela O. She was great, thanks
4	Great service.
1	We purchase tickets to KL from Singapore. When we were at the check-in point, the airline staff member asked us to show our credit card. The details the airline had were completely different to our credit card's which sounds extremely dodgy. After verifying all our details, the airline realised that the ticket was purchased with a different credit card we don't recognise. Maybe some else's credit card. Kiwi however deducted the entire amount of the tickets from our bank account and we were not able to go back home. We had to buy new tickets for the double price, which is a disgrace because we lost the money of the original purchase made through Kiwi. The airline said that there is a lot of fraud going on with this web and several intermediaries in internet. I need my money back!!!
5	Lucie O'Bryan was the absolute BEEESSSS KNEESSSS!!! She was so helpful and she made sure I understand everything. She truly went over and beyond!
4	Thank you Kristina B. for your help and personal stance. The chat was very good and helpful.
5	There was a minor missunderstanding with our id's so i live chated with Yulia ,a very kind and professional agentand she resolved the issue.thank you very much Yulia for your help.
5	Customer service solved my problems in professional manner. Thank you, 5 stars!
5	I needed help on my baggage check in. I wasn't able to call but I jumped online and did the live chat with Ksenia B., who was great help! It was a fast and painless process.
4	My flight was from Phoenix, Az. to Boston, Ma. and the agent that helped me was Abigail, really nice service.
5	Simple and easy to use. No problems! Would use again.
5	I made a booking here for my parents, and i made a contact with them when my i couldnt reach my parents to know if they manage to take the next flight. And ms. Nina Turkian helped me to make sure that my parents checked in on the next flight by calling the airlines. I was relieved when she confirmed that everything was alright and they were checked in. It was a great service that i experienced at all.
5	I was amazed by the great support I got from Greg, It was the first time I used skypicker and I was amazed at such a fast and easy to handle service. Great success for your company and God bless you all.
5	Travelling with a disabled passenger I have been one of the awkward customers requesting additional required services of which Kiwi will make no money from. Despite this they have been a great help over both email and chat, providing everything requested and showing a very human side of customer service. Everything seems much nicer and simpler to sort when every response you get doesn't feel like a generic copy &  paste answer. Thank you Kiwi.
5	Thank for the great work Kiwi team!Service works great!And for the support team, inc. Babak, special thanks! They always know how to keep our nerves in calm!:)
1	"because the wrong terminal  information they gave,i missed my flight, after 3 hr i claim my probelm, they still didn't  arrange me any flight, I made 3 times over-sea call back, just get response ""they are in process"", for anyone who have business trip or important appointment, strongly recommand you to rethink about it"
3	I bet I can tell you why. Because you dont admit to your mistakes and fuck people around until the last minute causing much stress and then at the last minute deny responsibility and expect you to pay again. You have the cheek to expect that the customer will book with you again after your fuckups . Fuck you Skyfucker
5	Greg from customer service was extremely helpful and quick in aiding me to change my passport information.
5	Great price and fast customer service with Eugene through their online chat system made my travel bookings easy and there is a high chance I will use them whenever I travel again.
1	Flight to Milan cancelled, tried to claim through website and a message pops up saying claim through airline. Did so within 6 days of the flight being cancelled. .. Ryanair did their part and refunded the money back to kiwi.. which we never received until I had to chase them for my money.. they finally refunded but only for part of the flight.. This was a return connecting flight. After a few emails back and forth some which were rude... I decided to call them yesterday. . Told I should have claimed within 14 days with them or the airline. . But I repeated to them that I claimed within 6 days to airline.. They should pay all my money back including the return and connecting flight. . Got fed up asked to speak to manager.. was told manager is not available and he will call me back after an hour.. I agreed.. waited and no phone call.. how frustrating. . So its been 24h ours and still no phone call or email from them or the manager which I requested..I find this unprofessional  and rude... DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY. . If your flight is cancelled you will NOT get all your money back..
5	At first when I stumbled on Skypicker I instantaneously got amazed about the purity and easiness of the interface, this fresh feeling got me in and finally booked a ticket for my flight Korea-to-France. I want to recommend this website to everyone planning to and searching for an easy fly. Skypicker you rock !
4	Awesome website with great prices. I have used other flight booking website in the past but Kiwi is my new favorite. Their prices beat all the other guys, especially when I was in a bind and had too book a flight on one day notice. The live chat customer service could be improved but overall I'm very satisfied with there service.
5	I just spoke with a customer service representative named Alikhan Ramazanov. He was able to answer my questions quickly and provided great support when I was having trouble accessing my booking. Thanks Ali!
5	I had some questions regarding a booking for my familie, and even if it was quite far away from know, Lucie Polívková was able to answer my questions in a very friendly way, it was just great, thanks Lucie.
5	Tatyana K, Thanks a lot for your help! You were quick and clear, and reassuring... I appreciate that a lot when it comes to customer service. Good job!!!
4	Everything was easy, well documented, clear and worked for me.All three flights were on time, the booking system was clear.All good!
4	I would like to say a great thanks to Filip! You have been very kind, patient and useful!
5	I had a great experience working with skypicker, their systems is perfect, their employees working in customer support are more than pleased to help you 24/7. I will recommend skypicker to everyone!
5	Thanks to Francesco for the quick answer and the kindness
5	Best search engine I ever found which save me a lot of hastle. Eeasy to use with 24/7 custommer care.Did Use live chat where were very nice and helpful representative.I am not using anything else since.
3	RT @SoftLayer: Learn how @skypickercom offers tickets for flights up to 90% less with the help of a cloud-based ticketing portal. ≡ https:/…
5	Everything was just like they said it would be. Absolutely everything. We are amazed that we had no problems at all concerning the time and the checking process, especially because we had to change 4 flights in a row. We recommend Skypicker for finding the best option for your trip. Absolutely.
5	Excellent. Easy to contact, fast and efficient.
1	Not recommend at all I will go back to #kayak or #edreams where I get a friendly customer service .
5	Ewerything was perfect.Thank's Angelica and Karolina Regards.
5	thanks for nice friendly customer service, special thanks for kiwi team member ( Varvara ) A+++++++++++++
5	merci a alexandra, qui a ete tres comprehensive, tres chaleureuse et tres professionnelle, et a eris, brice, pour leur amabilité. tres bon service client. tres agreable... a l ecoute... de tres belles personnes....
4	I am very pleased with the service of travel consultants, there were several that helped me - Kateryna S., Ondra Pohl, Petra Havranova, Olga, Barbora Rejzkova. They almost immediately responded with details that I was trying to get. The only thing that keeps from giving 5 stars is that I was told I would be contacted once the travel consultant gets information from the airline regarding the baggage and I never was. I had to contact them again and ask again. But we're people, not machines, everyone can forget. Overall I am very satisfied with this service and would recommend to other people.
5	Eric from the customer service was great, I made a mistake on my reservation and he worked on it till it fixed. He called me back to ensure that every thing is good and the reservation was correct.
5	I used the live chat to check in for my flight and it was very fast and efficient. Henry did an excellent job at answering my question and he was very friendly. Great service!
5	Mrs. Nina is really good CS she helpfull and fast reposnd and very patient
5	To be short. I was in a difficult situation - had to find a flight with 2 changes for cheap price and not too lengthy waiting in airports between my flights... That was done by Skypicker! I am satisfied with their services and would recommend it to my friends.
5	It is really grateful wen you found people who work hard to get better solutions for your flight problems. Thanks to the whole team specially Sarka and Alexandra.Amazing job,thank you very much for the support
5	<https://t.co/EJRnCIT3TR>I have just used Skypicker for flight booking and it is the BEST...no doubt the best. Use Skypicker as its the best
1	Kiwi is clearly a cancellation trap company that makes a great deal of its money betting that customers will run into a problem, and be unable to cancel flights even for legitimate reasons. I have poor eyesight, and made a date error while urgently buying tickets, as the company's interface is confusing and allows easy errors. While there are laws in the US and other countries FORBIDDING companies from not refunding tickets within a 24 period, Kiwi expunged this ethical rule and denies refunds. They told me they would get back to me, and after three days I have yet to hear back. As I travel every week for business, I have used other 3rd party companies like kayak and others to buy tickets, and have always been successful in quick refunds. Kiwi, which recently changed names perhaps to evade the terrible reviews of its previous name, is exceptional in its predatory business practices.
5	had a live chat with Neil and he was very helpful updating out passport info for our upcoming flight. Much easier to work with than other major booking websites
4	I booked a round trip to Florida with <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>.  Outward journey was fine.   Return journey turned nightmarish,  with first flight from Fort Lauderdale to New York JFK cancelled due to bad weather,  then the replacement flight (organised by JetBlue Airline, , not Kiwi) further delayed, so I missed my flight from JFK back to London, late at night.  <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> found me a replacement flight,  at no extra cost,  for the next morning,  and got me the e-tickets to my phone in very good time.   They provided a very good service in an emergency - thank you very much.
5	I was looking for better route with affordable value and after few days search on all other platform, I found skypicker offered the suitable, affordable n convinient route for my traveling. The confirmation n ticket was send to us on time as mention. Awesome!
5	I want to thank the employee Skypicker - Tomáš Mužík (Travel Consultant) for the help with the meals on Board Pegasus and detailed elucidation of the emerged dock in her schedule! I even called from abroad to clarify all the circumstances and the maximum help! They employ English-speaking representative. All my questions received an answer that completely satisfied and would recommend Tomáš Mužík and buy tickets at Skypicker!
5	He was straightforward about what he and the company can do - which I appreciated.
5	I was anxious as I had not received a confirmation email! After a short and helpful conversation with Vika, everything is all cleared. silly mean had entered the wrong email address! Vika was so nice and got it cleared up with me on the phone so now I am all set to go abroad!
5	I'd like to thank Patrik for the awesome assistance provided when I needed help with my booking. That was really helpful and he promptly helped me to clarify all my issues. I definetly recommend the service.
4	My opinion us about the Chat -Costumer Service. I was assisted by Ali, who help me to solve my questions about my reservation and to find the information that I was looking for,The service was fast and his communication was clear.Many Thanks
5	Why I think it is the best company for searching and buying airplane tickets: I am from a city with a small airport and this airport is not searchable via other similar services, but it is always there for the search via <http://skypicker.com|skypicker.com>. I can fly to my own city and I am happy :). So all perfect with Skypicker. Improvement could only be achieved in case of the airplane companies - for example to improve the noise in airplanes or air pressure in the planes having some impact upon ear pressure.
5	Very responsive to the messages! I needed to buy an extra luggage a day before the departure and they helped me immediately. Overall, I am very satisfied.
5	@skypickercom 1. They say I have 0 checked baggages -> Upon incessant inquiries I'm informed that I have one bag unto 15Kgs free. (2/3)
5	Jakub was very nice to help mee, i hope i will met him online next time i get problems
5	Very good service, thanks to Seth Alex Boahene
5	I had a problem with email password reset notification. I  contact with support agent - Miquel.I havent aceess to my profile(I forgotten my passsword), but I can't restore pass, so Miquel helped me with my tckets, filled some required information, and send tickets on my emal. Thanks for it, it was very useful for me.
5	Kudos to the thoughtfulness, professionalism and kindness shown by all the staff in general, and Tomaš Jurik in particular that on the occasion of the aid applied for interpretation problems on baggage policy has proved very knowledgable and helpful.
5	I had few questions about my flight and check in because of myself, So I deciede to write on Live chat for support. I wrote this time with Enri A. and I want to tell thanks for your kindness and help. I wish to all companies and services be like SkyPicker and like Enri A.Its not my first time when I am booking my flights with you and for sure I will continue with you and using your service. Congrats and thank you.Wish you all the best.
4	So far so good. I quickly received my booking confirmation and my eTickets, and Yuriy N. was helpful during our chat. My flight is a couple of months out, so here's hoping that nothing goes wrong and I don't get into one of the situations the bad reviews mention. I'm rooting for you SkyPicker!
4	Booked our flights home with Kiwi! Everything was fast and easy with them. We needed to pay for our seat selection but the offer had expired, Anastassia was awesome and helped us to get our seats and book them!
4	Eric, the person I had on the phone was very kind and helpful.Thanks
1	Today, January 7th, 2017, I accidentally booked a flight for March 12th 2017 when I needed it for Feb 16th, 2017 from Bali to Chiang Mai. Minutes later I realized my mistake and called <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> right away but no answer and was on hold for over 15 minutes before I got frustrated and decided to use their live chat instead. Huri was my representative. After I explained to her the mistake I made and asked her kindly to change my flights, she said she couldn't unless I paid a fee. The fee itself was just as much if not more than the original flight I booked. Keep in mind. I needed the dates changed but I wanted the exact same flight that was being offered on both those dates. Bali - Boarding at 11:55 am, layover in bangkok and off to Chiang Mai and landing for 8:10 PM. In the end, they were extremely unhelpful and uncompassionate and couldn't do anything for me unless I paid them the same amount for my original flight. I don't understand why they couldn't do anything especially because I contacted them MINUTES after I booked and the flight was well in advance. I'm NEVER booking with <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> again.
5	Everything was great!
5	THE BEST COMPANY OF THE UNIVERSE!!!THANKS TO MAX!!
5	This morning ai contacted the assistance to obtain some information concerning my flight, and with great pleasure I received the support of Mr Tomas, who helped me greatly. If all other agents are like him I have no doubt I will book again a flight with them
5	Third time booking through Skypicker, first time I've had any trouble. My AirAsia flight was 1hr 25 minutes late and made me mis my connecting Scoot flight. AirAsia was no help at all blaming me for not allowing enough time between flights and refusing to do anything, not even a food voucher!So i contacted Skypicker through the live online chat and was instantly helped out and after only about an hour was offered a new flight home.Cheers to Martin and Henry for getting on my case so quickly.Thanks for the support.Bobby
5	Best customer service, got back to me straight away and helped with all my questions! Highly recommend!
5	Contacted the support team via online chat to assist me with an online check in. The support I received from an agent called Tamara was very quick and helpful. Tamara helped make the whole process quick and stress free. Thank you!
4	The best in it's area with a nice customer service, never had a problem
5	Skypicker and in particular the agent, Nataly, were extremely helpful  in accommodating last minute changes to multiple tickets.  The responsiveness and efficiency of all the agents was commendable and a huge relief while traveling abroad.  A great experience all around! :-)
4	Thank you to the wonderful staff of Sky picker, whom managed to help me through a long process of confirmation status for e-tickets. A special thanks to Bek and Sam (: (: (: (: (:
5	I originally booked my trip with Skypicker and when the name changed I got nervous, but they were the same friendly and helpful staff.  I called several times to add a name, select seats and add baggage... I was always helped quickly and the problem was resolved within a short time...don't hesitate to book with Kiwi...
5	They  are absoulely great.  The price is  the lowest. The change price  best ever.  The  fastness.  The only thing i regret  is that I  have not found this service earlier.   Just  Go only for them  and delete all other different  services phone applications.  I am so  happy with them that  i commit to spend  some one hour a week  to  recommend  Skypicker to  everyone.Thank you Marcin L.
3	Your company is a scam!!!
5	KIWIs personnel is great! Fantastic help was provided for an issue that they were not obliged to take care of. I would like to thank Juan Costa, who helped me with my wife's problem. Kiwi's response as company was great: regardless terms/conditions they really help,... as humans ... not like answering machines! Many thanks to all!
5	Jan Lukasek is very helpful and i appreciate to her.Thanks.
5	I spotted an error that was made on my part after booking.Upon contacting online support, Thomas quickly and efficiently made necessary changes. I'm looking forward to my flight and booking again! Thanks so much!
5	A quick response .Thomas was a very efficient agent . Thank you !
5	This is my first time using SkyPicker and it was a wonderful experience. Everything is clear in the web page. When you are selecting your flights all the terms and conditions are clearly marked and explained.The process is very clear and easy, the web page is clear and friendly, and the customer support is the best!! You have a 24/7 customer support and you can contact them in many different ways. They are nice, helpful, polite, friendly and really professional.I loved this experience and I recommend it for sure!!
5	Skypicker provides great and professional services. I bought a ticket and had a slight problem with check-in. Thankfully, the help provided by one of the consultants Eva, was very useful and fast. Cheers!
1	First and last time I have/will use this company skypicker.The worst company I have ever dealt with.Made mistakes left right and centre, no apologies, no help, and a rip off.Used my flight out but had to book new flight for nearly 100 pounds as they made a mistake on my return journey and wasn't willing to assist me.Customer service team probably don't even know what day of the week it is.If carlsberg tried to create the worst company in the world. Pretty sure this would be it.Stay well clear.People that have left good reviews obviously got lucky. But 1 mistake by skypicker, then say goodbye to your hard earned money.
5	Jan J was very helpful helping me out with a mistake I had made when booking. A very good example of customer service. Thanks Jan
5	Extremely helpful staff. Gio responded within minutes and my queries were answered without any stress. Thank you very much, other agencies should follow Kiwi example.
1	The worst experience ever! I booked with Skypicker to travel from Singapore on 28th Jan. The airline changed the flight to 27th and I accepted the change. However on the 26th I discovered that Skypicker were still telling me I Was booked for 28th.I still had to travel to SIngapore so I emailed only to get a reply saying they would respond within 48 hours. That was too late so I spoke to an agent via live chat who after several hours still insisted I was booked on 28th on a flight that did not exist. I even checked with the airline directly and they confirmed no flight at 20.00 on the 28th, After several hours with the online agent Lusine G trying to get this sorted I got another email confirming booking on the 28th.By this time I was scared. I was travelling on my own an no idea if I was going to get home.I didnt have access to a phone but managed finally to call via Skype. I told the young man I had an email confirming my booking on a non-existent flight. Another hour later I received an email saying I was travelling on the 27th.This totally wrecked the last days of my holiday - and dealing with staff who didnt give a toss was really scary!And..... my so called cheap flight ended up costing me $200 more than I expected!
5	I have called many times and everyone I spoke with was very professional and helped me with all issues. This is the first time I have had such an experience with a booking site. I highly recommend using them.
1	While traveling around India, I booked a flight from Amritsar to Mumbai got the booking confirmation, but not the email and when i called the next day they said that they cancelled my booking and that they didn't contact me because my Indian phone number didn't have the country code.  And that's it, I got stuck in Amritsar and had to deal with my hotels bookings and my planing last Minuit, the costumer service was not good at all. Still enjoyed my time in India :)
5	I booked a journey for the wrong date by mistake, and the employees at Kiwi were very helpful in helping me out of the sad situation. I thought it would be a problem, but a few hours later Kiwi was able to give a full refund of the ticket. That is service! Thanks to Pavel Burian, Monika Grabovska and Christina Zhurina.
5	I needed help in order to change my small cabin bag to a large one and a kind man, Eric helped me a lot this morning.I asked for help from the helpdesk of this company already 3 times, and they were always kind and helpful. Thank you!
5	I book tickets with Skypicker from Edinburgh to Majorca via London on beginning of September but we travel on middle of October. Very cheap £120 return ticket. We flight with Ryanair, Skypicker made our online check in and send us boarding passes. We didn't have any problems at all! I will use it again!

1	I have used many different online agents, and I haven't so far had any issues with the bookings or tickets. I have always received an e-ticket after 2-5 minutes.Yesterday I tried Skypicker for the first time - I mean, they looked like a good site.I got an email saying they need 240min to get me an e-ticket - are they doing this manually? Why isn't this working automatically as all the other agents?After an hour they get back to me and ask for more money - I smelled something fishy here and was considering getting the tickets from another more reliable online agent. However, I didn't want to wait up to 10 days to get a refund, so I payed the extra money.One hour later I get another email saying the flight didn't have any available seats. I did a search on other agents, and they are offering the same seat on the same airline for almost the same price. I once again searched on Skypicker and they are still offering this flight. What is this?I wrote on Facebook to ask about this and was told that they are not eligible to sell these other ticket fares and will remove this from their website. What's funny is that they are still (today) offering this flight - now for a much lower price. What are they really doing here? Why are they asking for more money (which I payed), if they are not eligible to sell these tickets?
5	Helle everyone, I am very satisfied with fast resolving of my problem. Dorota Zigova was very kind and polite. Thanks for eveything.
5	Perfect service from beginning to end, only bad service from the flying companies
5	Eric Ropars was very helpful with answering our question and took the time to explain step by step on what we need to do. this was our first time booking flights on line my daughter will be so happy that all of us could make it to her wedding. thank you so much Eric.
1	"One more episode... Yesterday i booked some flights for my family. Payment was done, but then afterwards i received the information that the Reservation couldn'tr be done, and that the reimbursement could take up to 10 days. How is this possible? How can you accept a payment without assuring a reservation before? Is that even legal?Now i have to wait for the money to come back (hopefully) in order to make another booking, and meanwhile the prices are rising, obviously.Misters, what is your legal address? I'd like to start an official complain. And please avoid the Copy/Paste that i've seen already: ""we are sorry to hear that you have been dissatisfied bla bla bla"", i don't care what you think. Please act."
1	"Booked one flight with KIWI, they duplicated the charge after claiming it had been refunded or voided ( it wasnt), refused to admit the mistake, refused to acknowledge my bank statement print screens showing the charge. They then charged me another £227 for another flight I didn't purchase and refused to acknowledge this as well. Customer service agents had no idea what was going on, had no links with the finance department Finance responded to disputes with automated emails. They made two errors in two bookings - a 100% record of incompetence. I was promised call backs which never came, spent hours on the phones, sent email after email.The best KIWI could do was say is take it up with your bank. Finally two months later, after raising two disputes with my banks fraud team on both my debit and credit card did I receive my refunds for the two mistakes KIWI made (over £400) through my bank, this had nothing to do with KIWI.Today I receive an email form Kiwi saying, oh Mr Fox turns out you were correct, we blame technical issues, heres a 25 euro voucher towards booking another flight with our ramshackle defrauding company. Its not a mistake, its just plain theft.""I am writing to you regarding your reservation 1179908. Please let me apologize for the delay in communication with you and for the situation that happened.I would like to inform you that after several detailed checks on your situation, we found out that, unfortunately, due to technical issues, you were charged twice, indeed. Please accept our apologies for that. One of the payments has been already refunded, could you please check with your bank if you have already received it? In case of any problems, let us know and we will be happy to help.We understand that the situation might have been stressful and frustrating, therefore, we would like to offer you 30 EUR voucher that you can use for your future purchases of flights with Kiwi"". You must be having a laugh."
1	"WARNING !This company is not seroius reliable.We have just booked two flights from Portugal to Malta.Paid the money...and after a short time Skypicker cancelled thewhole booking...in sniper style.We called them in ??? via telephone...they played the game""oh,sorry...we cannot understand..""We do NOT know,to whom we have spoken...or where is the""headquarter""...very spooky.WE WILL NEVER USE THIS COMPANY.Take care-there are much better companies on the market.."

5	I was on hold for quite some time but I finally got a hold of a representative and she was lovely. Lucie O'Bryan was very helpful, kind, and efficient. She contacted Spirit airlines for me and fixed a mistake that I made on a birth date.
5	Lorena Gallo was very helpful.  She quickly answered my questions and was able to set my mother up with wheelchair assistance.Thank you for your friendly and efficient service!

5	Tereza and Barbora went out of their way to ensure that my Mum and her friend got good seats on all flights booked via <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com>.   Having used many online services over the years, I was very surprised st the level of detail and attention to good service given by Kiwi staff. Tereza and Barbora were amazing and I'm very glad to give this 5 star review to <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com>

3	@skypickercom the customer care number for India does not work! I had to call the US customer care #
1	Very good product, but very poor customer service. I recommend you to use it just and only as a search engine and you will do better by booking directly with the airlines.I got promised to get a tax fees and airport fees refund when I was trying to cancel my itinerary, however after the flight left I was informed that even this won't be possible. I would take the flight if you don't promise me a partial refund!
5	Me gustaria dar las gracias particularmente a Juan Costa, me atendio perfectamente y con mucho tacto a traves del telefono, lo considero un gran profesional...te doy Juan Costa mil gracias por tu ayuda telefonica, me dejaste mucho mas tranquilo por telefono y has sido super rapido solventandome las dudas...gracias de nuevo.
5	I've just booked my flight with @SkyPickerCOM. Find some great deals too at <http://t.co/2eZewyqPfI>
3	Online check-in was readily arranged by Skypicker but unfortunately I have run into a problem with my cabin baggage when I changed flight in Birmingham coming from Dublin and going to Budapest. The size parameters of cabin baggage were different for the first (Ryanair) and the second (Wizzair) airline and because the check-in was done not by me, I have noticed this issue only when boarding to Wizzair. Consequently I had to pay an unpleasantly high on-site fee for the oversize bag.
2	Learn how Skypicker provides ticket buyers flights for up to 90 percent less with the help of a cloud-based ticketin…<https://t.co/YJfdvDAtlL>
1	Today noon my husband booked a ticket for next day travel to Mexico. Shortly after I was informed not to travel by my doctor due to a long awaited two appointment at the hospital was made possible. When we reached out to Skypicker customer service with my problem there were strict policies which didnt make it possible for us to get any help. No refund, no change of date, no help at least. We of course understand the policies in the booking, but would at least expect to get more help and support in a messy situation as we faced. We tried several times to get help from the customer service but showed indifference in our case. With No refound and any chance in my reservation , they just screw me over and sadly just lost my money, the money for my booking was a waste and now i can't be able to buy my ticket again or my money back.
4	When a flight got delayed I missed my connecting flight leaving me stranded in an airport. I used the chat function which was not helpful as they told me to connect with the airline. Which was closed when I got to the counter and the airport encouraged me to call in the morning, I had no idea what to do. I got a place to stay for the night, booked a different flight and set up a Skype account to make calls. In the morning I saw I had recived and email giving me flight options based on the chat I had had earlier. I called the company and Simon was very helpful in getting things figured out. I definitely recommend calling as they are more promt and can give you time lines on information and support. Although it started off rocky, they have done everything to try and support me and I am very appreciative. I recommend them and would book with them again. Thank you.
5	I purchased tickets on the kiwi website, but I didn't see there was an error with the name. I asked online consultant about the issue and Tomas Jurik helped me a lot. Thank you very much, Tomas! Wish you all the best! :)
5	The 72h deadline for the check in is very early and impractical. But luckily if you miss it the <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> customer service is very helpful. In my case Mohammed did the check in for me after that deadline and saved me from having to pay the airport check in fee.Thanks a lot!
5	Thank you very much for your wonderful assistance that I received from Leonardo and Marius, they are professional guys, I really thank you kiwi company for your way to care about you clients. my best
5	It's been an absolute pleasure dealing with you guys! The people behind the phones are really helpful and patient. Looking forward to our long ongoing relationship. 5*
5	I spoke with Martin Carter today and he was very helpful. He patiently answered all my questions (and there were many). The live chat feature was very easy to use. I would definitely use Skypicker again. Thank you
5	A shout out to Sasha for the excellent customer service rendered in confirming my flight details. Thank you for the help offered.
2	As a seasoned traveler I would rate Sky picker totally useless and incompetent.  Will NEVER use them again. Total mix up with booking flight tickets Johannesburg to George.  Unable to deal with the simplest request.  Took 1 week and 8 e-mails to add 1 golf bag to luggage.  Then they only managed to put it on the return flight and said I would have to do the outward flight at the airport.  Every time I contacted them I got a different person (and in a different country.) Not one was fluent in English. Could not respond to their erroneous emails as their email addresses did not accept incoming mail.  So how do you get in touch and sort matter out.  I phoned but despite promises they failed to return my call or sort matter out.  Eventually I contacted Airline myself and sorted matter out in 5 minutes.   Total INCOMPETENCE goes no where in describing their abysmal service. I still have to reclaim the cost of adding the golf bag with the Airline which they failed to do and for which they charged me.I  I just don't know whether I can go through the next 5? or 6? or even15??? emails it may take to secure the refund. Use this agent if you don't mind their incompetence.
1	Do not book ticket through <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> from India to USA. You might get ticket for a cheaper price but they will give you connect flights that will kill you through out the journey. They will book you a domestic flight separately that will not include luggage. They will allow you only 15 kgs and only 1 bag for check in. So you have to pay extra for the first domestic flight. A lot of Rs. in India. And connect flights suck. My initial flight time was 24 hrs now it became 40 hrs. If at all you book make sure your ticket is same for though all the connections. Good luck!!
5	Booking process was very easy, I received all necessary travel information on time and was happy with my itinerary as I didn't have to visit separate airline websites to book.
5	First time user. Simple interface and booking process, great price on route I couldn't find elsewhere. Definitely a great option if you're looking to find a route which may save you money.
3	@skypickercom hey thank u so much for ur help- I know my ticket is non refundable but please process my air tax and any other charges- thanx
4	I book with them în june 2016, but unfortunately I lost my email.Later în August I find where i made the pay and after a phone call they help me to recover my booking. Easy process with profesionals.Yes like Simon H who help me today with my check in , because i forget to send my passport details în time and possible to pay for check in at the airport.Thank You <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> thank You Simon H.
4	I booked tickets for my flight with skypicker. Very good services, did all quickly and correctly. They even checked-in (it was a surprise for me). The only thing I should use once their live-chat to remember them about my another flight's check-in...But the rest is VERY ok.
5	I had a problem with my boarding pass, but the Adam at the customer service was very helpfull and sorted my problem.

5	I am very happy with the quickness of response from the online chat and really glad the agent could immediately change one of the passenger's name (that I have written incorrectly, by accident). The change was quickly made at no cost.Thank you very much.Mariana
5	I had been running into persistent difficulty while trying to enter and save my travel document details and check in online. I was extremely satisfied by the live support I got from Jana, who was pleasant, very efficient and able to resolve my problem in minutes. She followed up by providing me with useful information in relation to checking in on my return flight - something valuable to a non-frequent flyer like myself. Not only that, she added a nice personal touch of recommending a local Slovakian dish to explore on my travels. Couldn't have asked for more from a support agent. Well done Kiwi with the choice of staff!
4	I would use your service any time and it is well recommended
5	I highly recommend this website for booking flights across the globe. I had an exceptional agent by the name of Tomas Jurik, who helped me with all of my inquires. The response to my questions were precise and prompt, and I am speechless at how quick and effective my needs were met by this booking agency. Thank you!
4	I had some problems with downloading all our boarding passes - I went on the chat, and Dorata solved the problem. Great service. The homepage is not in the “high end” – a bit boring, but it works.

1	"Do not buy from that company. You will pay and two hours later, you will get this email:""During the process of your booking we have encountered the following concern: There is a technical issue in the carrier's reservation system preventing us from finishing the booking. As a result of the above we will be refunding to you in full the cost of the initial booking.""And they will say that you refund will arrive in ten days.I was also supposed to get a 10$ voucher by clicking on a link on a page advertising their new app but never get anything!"

This is one of the best things I like so far about Skypicker. I've never experienced any difficulties and this is also why it's always my go-to online ticket booking site whenever I travel. Keep it up! Thank you very much! :)"
4	I called with an issue with my boarding pass and the agent Youssef Souini was very helpful and understanding. Our conversation was friendly, straight to the point and quick. Only issue was I was on hold for like 10 minutes before a rep answered my call. Kiwi, you guys should be a little faster. Great job hiring Youssef though.
1	I booked my shanghai to sg flight through skypicker, for my family of four. They got us seats which are 19 rows apart! How do I care my young children? Called them to solve the problem but was told to purchas quiet seat which cost me at euro150 for putting my family together.
5	The online chat is probably the best customer support idea! No need to waste your money on calls to foreign countries. The staff is very helpful and answered fast all my questions!
5	Well, I just want to thank travel consultant Tamara K, for quick reaction and super-helpfulness! She helped me to update my personal data (which was wrong and that was my fault) in tickets really fast. She was really nice and polite. Thank you!

5	My boarding pass wasn't sent to me so I used your online chat service. I spoke to Monika who was very helpful, friendly and sorted the issue for us straight away.
5	I just hung up the phone with Pedro, a representative of Kiwi who answered my call and I wish every service person could give the kind of attention and patience that he did! He calmed down my worries and made me feel welcome to ask any questions.Everything he explained was clear, simple and he made sure I understood everything and made sure I had no additional questions.He even went ahead and helped me pre-book my boarding information without me asking!Great service all around.#EachOneTeachOne - Pay it forward and teach others by leading by example to make a better world :)

I didn't think I would get home after missing my connection due to the strikes, but they were able to put me on another flight later that day at no cost despite being a budget airline (Ryanair). Really glad I booked through sky picker especially when comparing stories to others who are still stuck in the departure location because of the strikes and having to eat up hefty rebooking and lodging fees.
4	I had some problem with my check-in, because i didn't know, that i can only give my document details 48 hours before the flight. I think, thats a bit misunderstanding, because I'm used to check in in the last 48 hours and not before. I then tried the chat for help and Daria helped me really really quick and uncomplicated and after 5 minutes i had my tickets. Great service!!
5	I had a problem obtaining my boarding passeswhile been abroad.I sent an rmail to them & they reply fast & profesionally.In less than 20 mins I had them in my email ready for printing.They were really helpfull
5	I haven't yet boarded the plane that I booked on <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com>, but contacting the customer service for getting some information confirmed is an easy and quick undertaking and the staff is very helpful (thank you Bubak). Now I hope that the journey goes as uncomplicated as this.
5	I had some questions about the weight of the luggage, Anna was answering my question and sending me the new information immediately, but the most important is that she was very gentile, It was a very good experience with the chat on line and in general I am very happy with the service. I had a chat yesterday too, but I dont remember the name of the person, I have to say that the service was very good too.
5	Just had a talk with Pavel from Customer Service regarding a glitch in the system concerning luggage bookings. He was very friendly and really looked into my problem. I know now what has happened and that everything will be fine. I have only rarely had the occasion to be treated this nice from a customer service agent. Perfect communication, keep it up!
5	Effective and fast
5	You guys offered me the BEST option to complete my trip in the cheapest in and most convenient way.
3	Thank you. We will wait for your response.
5	This was my first time when i bought tickets with this website and i know that i will buy again in the future. I speak with  Customer Support and they help me very fast(I need the eTickets).I recommend them  everyone!
5	thanks to kristina blahova for helping me change the email address. not forget to puput anggraini cibro for helping me in my journey with <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com>
5	Thanks very much for Romain on the live chat, who helped me to sort my problem with the check-in. It`s very nice to travel with a company where are people there to help straight when it needed.I`m travelling first time with the Skypicker, and I have a very good experience so far.
1	"I was booking a flight to Bali, Indonesia and the search engine is so poorly designed it automatically corrected to Balikpapan, and I booked $400 USD worth of flights (including extremely expensive checked luggage). The next day I realized the mistake and that I needed to be landing in Denpasar, DPS. When typing in the word ""Bali"" it didn't even suggest Denpasar! I made numerous attempts to chat and phone to fix this problem. The only offer of ""fixing it"" was to add on two more flights, at an additional cost of $400 USD. It would be FAR cheaper to just forget Skypicker and book the correct flights through a better designed site and a company with better service. Lastly on top of this, I talked to Alexandria who was sighing constantly throughout the whole phone conversation. She was extremely unhelpful and kept repeating herself and offering me no solutions. I asked to talk to a manager, which I was told there might get a call back, which I have yet to receive."
5	I would like to take this opportunity to thank Juri Cervenk for his help in sorting out a change over at Milan airport,I boked a connecting flight from Bristol to Malta via <http://Milan.in|Milan.in> errorBeing a disabled person I was somewhat distressed with my error, I was very fortunate to be allocated to your travel consultant, Juri, who dealt with my dilemma very professional and courteous manner, making sure there was assistance available for all flights.Once again, Thank You, Peter davies
5	I've had an issue with my booking so I contacted Customer services and when I talked to Daniel, he made sure to help me with every problem I had. Such good customer service I very much appreciate
5	I ordered several flights. everything works great! including phone support . James from Norway  support, who was excellent professional and helped me solve my check in. Very good! Thank you James!
5	Very helpful and kind support on phone by Saskia!
5	I had to have update on my flight plan, and I got connection with CS, Ms. Julia. Thanks for the great service and quick response of Ms. Julia, i will be enjoying the flight schedule.
5	Werry fast, and good service! Emre T. Was werry polite and help me get my Bording pas right away!
5	We needed a reasonably priced return ticket for the two of us to Budapest, so I took advantage of an offer with and indirect flight on the way back. The price was much lower than with a direct flight, and we don't mind spending a couple of hours in a city we haven't seen before. I quite liked that we did not have to do the online check in either, everything was done for us and the luggage sizes were accurate, no stress about extra charges.
4	Very quick and helpful chat from Lenka and Thomas. Informative and to the  point. I mistyped a letter and they did their best to get it right.
5	I missed the date to do my online check-in for my holiday flights. I contacted the live chat support from kiwi's webpage. They answered very quickly (no more than 15 minutes) and Tamara was the agent that took me. She did a great job by doing all the check-in's with the airlines (since I no longer could do it myself) and sent me the boarding passes to my email. Excellent costumer service, looking forward to book with this company in the future.
5	Muy buena atencion y mucha paciencia por parte de Michaela que ha sido la asistente que me ha ayudado! thankyou very much Michaela it has been a pleasure talking with people who really want to help and they do it! so thankyou very much for all.
5	,  very fast answer and very helpfull Agente: Zdenka B
5	Today, with Michaela, my first experience with Kiwi, and this lady was very very nice... she help me with all of my questions! to use again... Thanks Michaela :)
4	We dein't receive our boarding passes as stated, but after 5 min. chat with  Anna Trush they were in my mailbox :-)Good support
5	Thank you for in time helping
1	communication from Rynair to this brokers was not forwarded. We had to add additional 90 euros as a result
5	I want to thank Martin Carter and so many of them for working on my confusing case. Now i expecting the money back to my account. Thank you guys.
1	Very disappointed with Skypicker. Everything was good up until right after I clicked the pay button. From there everything went downhill. Thought I would be paying for a plane ride home without any hassle or frustration. But I was so wrong. Soon after I purchased the my ticket, I was sent an email saying the purchase is being reviewed. Soon after that, I received a confirmation to my payment along with another email stating they were only able to get me checked luggage for one of my two connecting flights. Instead of not going through with the payment, they indeed go through with it and insist I just pay for the extra luggage at the second airport and send them a receipt later on to get reimbursed. Do they think I'm really going to pay $25 CAD per kilogram for 15 kgs of extra baggage and hope to get reimbursed later? No way. That's $375 CAD down the drain for me. What an awful, awful company that they'd go and do this to a struggling traveler. Luckily, I booked way in advance so I have 1.5 months to sort this out. But really, I shouldn't even have to be sorting anything out. This should have been and could have been avoided from the very start. Shame. Will keep this review at 1 until some light shines upon this dark, twisted company.
1	My husband and I booked a flight from Jakarta / Indonesia to Frankfurt / Germany with transit in Kuala Lumpur and Ho Chi Minh City (CGK-KUL Flight number QZ208, KUL-SGN VN674, SGN-FRA VN31).The airlines were Air Asia and Vietnam Airlines.On our E-tickets Skypicker there was nothing mentioned in the flight informations about the exact terminal we will arrive in Malaysia Kuala Lumpur.At the airport in Jakarta we asked the Junior Manager of Air Asia to which terminal we have to go in Kuala Lumpur for our next flight to Ho Chi Minh City, we have received no information about it, and on our e-tickets there is no terminal specified.He looked in the computer system by saying that we had to change the airport, which is about 44 km further away (none of it was provided to us by Skypicker).In addition, the manager said that there would be no problems for us when our departure terminal would be from any terminal in the same airport terminal, however, he saw in the computer system that our departure terminal was much further away.For the attainment of the terminal, which we needed, he said we would need a visa now! All the informations my husband and I got to know at first at the airport in Jakarta, which is quite too late! Skypicker gives no indication of the departure terminal nor the arrival terminal, and keeps quite about neccessarily informations to the passengers (deliberately?) as in our case, about a 44 km further distant departure terminal.Skypicker did not inform of any additional transfer costs, which the passenger must plan for the journey of 44 km, the passenger will have to accept this surprisingly. Because Skypicker withholds this information, the passenger does not know anything about a transfer within the arrival country. Accordingly the passenger may not require for a visa apply early in order to continue after a stopp the flight route. Because there has not been expressed with a single word that the Terminal has to be changed.Kindly the Air Asia staff helped us a lot, we tried together to achieve Skypicker phone, since the time until departure was very scarce and there was not enough time for a (time-consuming) e-mail traffic. Unfortunately, you could not help us in this situation and discussion on english seemed to be difficult on the airport, because the air port staff in idonesia doesnt speak very well english. We could not take the flight because of withheld information from Skypicker and we were forced to buy new tickets.Because of Skypicker we paid totally 4 ticket prices from Indonesia to Germany (for 2 people).We have a contact of Air Asia and want to inform Air Asia and Vietnam Airlines about our dissatisfaction with Skypicker and on high frequented, famous German Internet forums and communities we urgently warn against Skypicker!! We like our  our entire airfares to be refunded because Skyspicker retains flight relevant data and takes money, for not providing anything in return.Greetings from Cologne/ Germany,Robert Köppen
5	The agent I spoke with was very polite and extremely helpful. I was very pleased how quickly he resolved my issue and checked additional information for my convenience. Amazing customer support!
5	Dear Olga. Thank you for your understanding and patience on my deaf situation, and translator (sign language). Quickly and efficiently. Very professional. Thank you so much for your kind services (help at the last minute in my case). I will give you 5 stars out of 5. Thank you very much and keep up the good work !!! All the best! Nina.
5	At any time, they will do their best to help you. great job and nice team.thank you to Eva and Archil!
1	@skypickercom the worst service I ever had. Please don't make anything with them. They don't Pay the flights and then you lost it.
5	I have been assisted on the live chat by Selorm, was very kind, quick and efficient. I had the answers I needed and even more. I really appreciatre such a good service when you have tickets this cheap. Thanks Kiwi !!!
5	I booked for a flight which was made up of two flights.  This was made clear from the beginning.  Overall, the instructions were thorough.   There was sufficient time between flights  to transfer easily and to have the opportunity to shop and eat.  The price provided not only appropriate flights and scheduling but a real saving over competitors,The two airlines involved and SkyPicker even automatically provided on-line check in servuce.I plan to use SkyPicker again, in the immediate future.
5	Booked multiple flights with skypicker and made it easier than booking separate. Bek in CS helped me added a few of my details and answered straight away, no waiting what so ever, very happy, will use again
1	5 days I am trying to change air ticket. I started to change it 20 days before flight. I chose new ticket with the term in September. Fifth day of when trying to change the map give me an offer for which I should pay extra travel costs of disposal for more than 2 months almost at the level of the existing ticket.The funny thing is they write that they are available 24/7. This page should be avoided.
5	Work at Skypicker! Hundreds of positions available in Prague and Brno, join us in changing the travel industry. <https://t.co/ofaYSGzjRn>
5	Thanks to <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> for professional and patient assist with adding my bike to my flight. Especialy to Dorota Žigová
5	Katerina G. was very willing to help and find the true answers for my questions about transfers at the airport and i send my best wishes to her for her kind efforts.
5	I did not expect so strong security protection from kiwi side, and had  a chance to spend hours on buying 1 ticket, proving I'm not a fraud. but Nina solved all issues in 5 minutes!! She's great! Thank you Nina!
1	I booked from skypicker because it supposed to be very cheap. but at the end it was more expensive than if I booked a direct fly to my destination. all the extra fees such as more luggage (weight) and extra payment in the airport because you need your boarding pass printet out and so on, added up.I had a return trip to my home with 1 transit, and I needed to change the return trip for another date, so what skypicker did, was to only change the last flight to 1 month later. it ment that the first flight to the transit was still on the same date, which I needed to change, but the second flight was rebooked for another date. In other Words I should stay in the transit for 1 month like Tom Hanks. It was not a nice service i got and it did not matter what I said, they only followed the rules like robots. I recommend to use other airservices than skypicker.
4	I just booked two connecting flights and was very upset as my iPad would not take my passport details and was told to use a laptop or PC which I don't have .Elena G came to the rescue and was amazing and took my details and did it for me .She was fantastic,but would be very slow to use Skypicker again as can't enter checkin details with iPad .Love the web site,and travel a lot and everything fantastic so far except iPads not excepted
5	I had a problem with the accepted luggage for two flights, I wrote by chat and Zdenka gave me all the information and an excellent service. I'm very happy with the final solution, i't works very well for me.
5	I would like to publicly thank the agent Igor Guzvinec for its friendly treatment and kindness, there should be more people like him.
5	I made an error when booking a flight for my sister-in-law and when I contacted skypicker, they responded right away and was able to help me fix the error I made quickly. I would recommend using Skypicker and plan on using them in the future again. The representatives that helped me were Enri A. and Magda P. Thanks again for the professionalism.
5	I booked my flights back home from Cambodia to Australia using Skypicker and was really happy. The prices were cheap, the customer service was good, and the e-tickets came through straight away.I did contact them asking them to see if they could relocate my seat to the aisle, or near a toilet facility as I was quite sick (the reason i was going back home). They wanted to charge me over $100 AUD. I obviously didn't pay it, but my seats ended up being on the aisle anyway. Was just a little annoyed by this but by all means this service is really really good and I have recommended it to my friends already.
5	I called with a question and a lady called athina was very helpfull so so much that i had to make sure i come here and write this review ...thats how great she was ..thank you for your customer service...
2	But we have Skiplagged --> A startup that finds discount flight tickets 'hidden' on airline websites launches in US <https://t.co/St5o9QrD18>
5	This was the first time we have used skypicker. We bought tickets from Billund to Vilnius with transfer in Riga. Tickets arrived on time and were as promised. Furthermore, skypicker checked us in. Good communication through-out the process
1	"When I arrived at the airport for my journey back home, I was informed that my flight was delayed by 2 hours. Because I was sure, that I won't be able to get my connecting flight I tried to contact the <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> service team via phone. After spending loads of money and time in their waiting line, I decided to give it another try once I arrived at the intermediate station. Upon arrival I - again - spend numerous minutes on the phone, waiting for someone to reply my call. Here again: no answer. The same with their ""service chat"". After realizing, that there is nobody capable of providing anything stated in their ""guarantee"", I decided to book the cheapest flight (110€) I could find to get back home. When I later contacted the support to get a refund for the expenses of the flight (I did not even expect anything for the 5 hours I spend at the airport, the food I bought or the phone costs), I was told to apply for a refund on their website, which i did. Almost a month later I received an approval for the refund. In that approval I was given the amount (86€) without any further information. This to me is plain unacceptable. One on hand there is a agency promising journeys ""as smooth and comfortable as possible"" and handing out ""guarantees"" and on the other hand there is just no effort to cover all that. I'm done with this agency. When I end up paying more anyway, I can also book a slightly more expensive flight somewhere else."
5	I generally dont book flights myself and i had some issues with the luggages. But the consultant Simon H. was a big help and did all he could to help me. I am very appreciative of his help!
3	@skypickercom a voucher of 150 for 2900 out of pocket?
5	I am very satisfied with the help of Lucie G. She solved my problem very fast!
5	I lost the connection between flights and after a few phone calls I found Ruben ( travel consultant ) .. He was untiring and resolved the situation . Thank you for your service ..
3	I sent a email please check it immediately I want to add my luggage

5	Very helpful chat line agent. Agent helped to make nessacary changes to my flight details quickly and efficiently. One less worry for me!
5	Speed a good booking through Skypicker. Printed Boarding pass saved a lot of time at airport. Everything was all right. We were satisfied.
5	Thank you, Eleonora and Cintia!!!
1	Absolutely dreadful service, mucked around for a week until eventually I couldn't get any refund on the airfares booked! Just taxes. Cost me over $800. They changed their story over and over, no money yet, of course...
5	I have spoken via chat on the site,about my flight, Mrs Olga M. is has been very nice, and she has solved my problem immediately.
5	Very good customers service. They helped me very fast.
5	I would thank Serhiy for her great assistance to solve my issue. I was very stressed and in less than 1 minutes she made my problem dissapear. Thanks again.
5	Was wary to use skypicker cause I've never used any of this sort of website. Their ticket cost WAY less than on the airline's website so I thought of trying it for the first time. Am on my way now - the emails for tickets and check-in information were timely. Thanks!
4	Had some troubles while booking a flight, however contacted agent Enri A. by the webpage chat who solved them all in a while, proactive and professional worker.
5	very good I will recommend others
5	Thank you dear Eric very much for your fast and nice help today :)
5	In overall I am satisfied with the work the customer support staff of the <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> website. Although I had to call more than once to be able to get separate invoices for the two persons I booked the tickets for.Anyway I like to thank for the help of two of your travel consultants,Jana Zdechovanová and Anna  Kayuda.Everything else related to the flights was as booked :).I will recommend this site to others for sure.

5	Great! Very accurate and helpful, thanks Alan! I really apprciate your help and effort
5	Had a couple of questions about my booking and they were answered quickly and efficiently via the live chat options. Thank you, Leah, very much
5	Great prices, easy to use website. Fantastic customer support, Valery did his job perfectly!
5	Service well rendered.Thank you so much Kseniya for your clarification
5	I moved overseas and had lots of questions about baggage weight and baggage fees. I flew through 3 different air carriers to reach my destination and the Kiwi agents told me exactly what would happen at the check in counters with each airline regarding my checked bags. Kiwi was not able add my second overweight bag to my trip and explained to me I needed to pay at the check in counters and then send the receipts for refund payments. Martin Carter was the most recent agent who helped me on their Live Chat feature which I found so helpful throughout my flight process. Since the agents explained what would happen on the trip I had no problems regrading my checked bags because I knew what to tell the employees at the check in counters. I thank you all so much.
4	Had trouble with my check-in, but Joao from the callcenter/support helped me out. Very nice guy! Good service
5	Nice customer support service(live chat). Resolved my case in a matter of minutes.
5	Had some issues with adding baggage to my booking and had immediate assistance on chat from Nina - a great help and booking now all sorted. Thanks Nina!
5	Very professional service before and during our vacation. Always asking if the can do more to help. We will definitely use <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> again.
5	Miss Eva gave me excellent care, alternatives offered me help. Besides offering you use the chat as often as necessary. It is very good and the prices are great reservations.
5	Michal was prompt in chatting and very helpful. Thank you.
5	I misspelled one of the passenger names. I thought I would have to jump through hoops to correct it but I emailed Kiwi's support and Catalina L. changed it for free. This was a multiple flight booking and she changed it for all of them. Very happy with the service.
5	I would recommend skypicker to anyone.
5	Enri A. and Margarita G. gave fantastic service. Not only were they both extremely competent in their job, they went out of their way to make my experience using SkyPicker enjoyable and easy. Thank you guys
1	I have just been through a very unsatisfactory experience with Skypicker.  We booked a flight from JFK to Milan and within hours started to get phone calls and emails saying they needed our passport numbers and expiration dates, staring that the booking could not be completed without them.  We have traveled a great deal and never have we been asked to supply this information and we were not going to give this private information out over the phone or email, so became suspicious of the whole transaction.  It sounded to us like a scam and we lost trust in the organization.I understand after the fact that this information was needed to facilitate online checkin for one of the airlines we would be flying and if the phone and email communications had asked to go the the Skypicker website, access our booking, click on the Manage Your Booking tab and enter the passport information there we would have understood.After telling us that the booking could not be completed without the passport information as soon as we talked about canceling the transaction the booking was very quickly completed.We will not be using the services of Skypicker now or ever again.
4	Process was very straight forward. No problems at all. Only issue I would say is that some of the baggage costs are higher thank would expect.
5	I had an issue with my booking, but the customer service was amazing.Mr. Nizar did a good job thank you
5	I liked the most that they checked in for us and even sent the boarding passes!
5	Very good service, thanks for David :)
4	I used Skypicker to book a flight with Ryanair (actually two, because I had a stop on the way), and it was great not having to deal with the hassle of booking directly on the ryan homepage. Also, when I had a question, the chat worked very well, the response was quick, friendly and service minded. Recommended.
5	Sara was just amazing, helping me in South Africa, to get a eticket to my bf in Thailand, this time of the evening/ we don't get this type of service in South Africa, thanks so much Sara, Europe is the best.You are a million dollarsLisa South Africa
5	It's was the first time I used Skypicker and I will definitely use them again.I forgot to write my daughters middlenames on the e-ticket, and I also wrote my mothers passport number wrong on the e-ticket. I was afraid that it would be a big issue. Skypicker was very helpful to clarify the matter and helped me to correct the mistakes.Thank you for your excellent service.Best regards,Tine Vorting
5	Quick and fabulous service.  Took care of my concern right away!
5	I had a problem with my flight as I need to change the hours of depart. MissMichala Stribrna help me a lot as she search any possibility to help. She is very professional and the thing that its impressed me was that she was speaking to my native language (Greek). This was the first experience that I have away from my Country and it is impressive. Thank you again Michala.Dimitris Ntapantas
5	I booked some flights but did not receive the confirmation email. I contacted Kiwi via the live chat and Patrik help me immediately.Excellent service.
1	"Got stuck in Vietnam after another airline had a delay.  Used skypicker to get a nice flight plan to get back in time for work.3 hours after ordering, they explain to me that ""everything is booked."" Those 3 hrs knocked out other flight options I could have taken.  Now I have an extra stay in a hotel and a missed day of work.  This is after they charged thousands to my credit card.  So I get to make sure that is stopped on to our everything.Just book directly with the airlines.  It's usually just as cheap and they actually have the seats that they will charge your credit card for.Very angry and stuck, don't be like me."
5	Hana has helped me and is very friendly and polite
4	Had a good experience with the customer help chat. Even on a Sunday someone was there which I think is unusual. Seth Alex was really helpful.
5	Needed some help in booking some extra services related to my flight, already booked via Kiwi. Aliaksandra was very fast in explaining me all possible options, in fact she found and offered me some extras that I even not realized they exist and that will make my flight experience nicer. Now I am waiting for my holiday flight in good mood confident that all needed is here. Thanks Aliaksandra!
4	I have reserved my flight with kiwi and I had some problem about my luggage. So I had a chat with Aurelija to solve my poblem. She is very nice and kind. I am not good at English well but she could understand me, I felt her friendly.Thank you so much, Aurelija!
2	A startup that finds discount flight tickets 'hidden' on airline websites just launched in the US <https://t.co/wpLYSvbIBJ>
4	I'm extremely satisfied with the services of the company. Initially, there was a wee delay in the tickets processing,however Ms. Lucie O'Bryan, travel consultant of the customer service department, helped me out with the clumsy situation in a highly efficient way clarifying the problem and offering me an immediate solution. Overall I'm very glad to choose the Blue Air as my new airline and I'm most definitely recommending it to everyone for the future.
5	I would like to thank Dániel who assisted me today in checking me into my flights! Nice service :]
5	Amazing product for finding cheapest flights for any destination! I really like the simple UI and how easy it is to book a flight with them (they do the online check-in for you; you don't have to worry about anything). Also, if you have any problem you can chat with great customer service (Albin really helped me last time). Amazing!
5	I needed a last minute assistance for my trip which seemed impossible to me but I called <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> customer service and I have received such a professional, kind and fast respond from Yulia Y, that I can comfortably travel now. Yulia represented a high level of knowledge, kindness, patience, and an awesome focus on the customer that is really great and a very helpful attitude. I can only thank you for the help and assistance I have received.
5	Kiwi services is absolutely the best carpet cleaning company out there. My carpet has never looked better. I recommend this company to everyone, simply because they do a really great job. The process that they do is surely to have your carpet clean for a long time.
4	i'm giving 4 stars for the above representative who went above and beyond to help me change my flights. she offered to find me a better price and guided me throughout the whole process! i hope all team members are as pleasant as her to deal with.one comment though - whoever looks after the companies inbox probably won't get any stars.. no SLA as to when to expect a response.. and yeah, i'm pretty much still waiting on it.definitely get on the chat if you need help guys!
5	I found the best price for my flight on Skypicker and the procedure was very easy.
5	I booked some flight in September. I realized almost twoMonths later that the airlines that I was suppose to fly with, had terrible comments. I contacted kiwi and within a week they refund me 100% my flights.I could not had them on the phone as I'm travelling and they always helped me via their chat, and got back to me by email as well!Thanks to the kiwi team and everyone that helped me.I will definitely recommend kiwi to my friends!
5	Besides missing a flight,  not reading details but also never aware of that visa is required between the flight transition. Flying from Boston to London and from London to Kiev.  I had great customer service unswearing all my questions and helping with a refund. Both phone and customer service were great. The last person i spoke to was Melica and i appreciate with all the details when i had to fill the refund form. Will keep this company in mind for the future booking flights.
5	Excellent service by most helpful staff.Answered very quickly when asked for invoice changes.Thank you Kiwi
5	Natalya helped me very fast and fixed my problem perfectly.Very nice person and polite.Thank you!
5	Eleonora C. from the Italian Customer Service, was very helpful and very informative. She made sure my booking details were right and she managed to send the boarding pass asap! Congrats!
5	Jan is a good guy! very helpful and competent!
4	Right now we are stuck in London due to weather delay, and dorota has been friendly and expedient in addressing our delay. Very nice in quite a stressful situation!
1	I am completely shocked by the poor level of customer service when it comes to rescheduling a flight. I will definitely not be recommending kiwi to anyone I know or any other traveler I meet along the way in Asia.I contacted this company 5 days before the flight we intended to take with the intention of rescheduling it well before the 48 hour deadline.The problems that I incurred were as followed:-they take a long time to get back to you-they take a long time to answer any questions or concernsIm still out 250$ USD and the time I spent trying to resolve this issue, which apparently, is a complete waste because even if you try and resolve it early it wont do you any good.On a side note, they sent me an email saying Air Asia would not allow such a flight change on the 5th day well past the deadline. Why do you give me an option to reschedule with any flight if you tell me Air Asia will not allow it. Why did you waste my time for 5 days when I couldve tried rescheduling my credit for another flight.DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR YOUR MONEY. DO NOT USE KIWI.
5	I've just booked my flight with @SkyPickerCOM. Find some great deals too at <https://t.co/dqTz0jOV89>
5	"I experienced a cancellation for my (budget) flight from Denpasar-Adelaide due to volcano eruptions. At first, I was worried that Skypicker would not book me a different ticket under the disguise of ""force majeure are exceptions"". However, surprisingly they were able to book me for a completely new flight (non budget even!) within 2 hours. I'm also told that I could claim the accommodation costs and transportation costs incurred. Therefore, the ""Skypicker Guarantee"" truly does speak for itself!I can only hope that my upcoming flight Denpasar-Jakarta will not be delayed, else I'll have to be in contact with Monica Snowden, Leonardo, Sawalani and the lovely team from Skypicker again"
5	i was really impressed regarding the high quality of the helpdesk support. The agent in charge with my issue , Irina, was very helpful and solved my request quicker than i thought it is possibile. She gave me confidence to book other flights.
5	Good Service and fast solution
5	I would like to give many thanks to Tomas - he was simply perfect! He was able to help us with everything very quickly a effectively. I would recommend him and <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> to everyone! Thank you very much!Tereza
5	Was very pleased with the cost of my ticket and the ease of booking. Recommend!
5	Easy to deal with
5	Tomorrow my trip has not been a changeI asked more than onceChange the flight dateThere is no answer to my request
5	Well, all my troubles about not receiving tickets to my mail was solved appropriatelly. Operator (P. Fridrich) was willing to provide me with all necessary informations. Connection of a support was clear, without strange noise etc. After all, as a Slovak, I appreciate support in Czech language.
5	This is my first time booking flights on my own, and even moreso, I have to coordinate flights through various destinations for myself and two other people with different schedules. Michaela O. was very polite and responsive with my questions concerning airports and scheduling. It really helped with my worry over this trip, and if anything else came up I'm not worried over being unable to contact the company at all.Thanks again, Michaela. Cheers!

5	The procedure is in progress but I've received a quick and satisfactory guide useful to solve my quest
4	SkyPicker is an excellent service for booking flights online, with good deals and a straightforward booking process. At first I had an issue with confirmation, but the customer service line was able to help me instantly and resolve the issue. I am very happy with how the process went.
1	I tried to contact <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> multipe times and left my number but never got a call back. They noted my issue over chat but never contacted me back so i had to contact back for status and at the end they failed to fix it.I ordered tickets for me and my girlfriend together buton the way from Oslo to Barcelona via Poland they got us seats in the last row next to toilet.on the way back from Madrid to Oslo via Brussels they got us seats apart from each other. Kiwi started to ask for additional price to fix it and they blamed Ryanair for this but if that is the case then what is the point of using kiwi.
5	Patrik was very helpful to me about my booking. He went out of his way to help me out and keep me updated all the time. Great Service. Need more people like him in this world. Thanks again, Sunny.
5	I had a positive experience and received helpful information through online chat from Jamie.Thank you for your help!
5	Thanks Simon, for your help with my booking, really appreciate your help.
1	Under which circumstances is it appropriate to notify someone that their flight was never booked due to a technical glitch 2 hours before the scheduled departure? My husband was at the airport checking in to his flight when he received a call stating his flight was never actually successfully booked (despite it being paid in full and receiving confirmation 3 weeks prior). No assistance offered to find an alternate flight and the customer service agent was less than helpful. My husband had to frantically search for a new flight (and pay again) that would allow him to make his connecting flight. Completely inexcusable.
2	"Have been battling <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> for 7 days because they charged me twice for one trip! Only customer service is via email, to which they respond with robotic, generic replies or chat, which is the same thing.  I finally spoke to a human today by calling the ""same day travel"" number and spoke to a woman named Issis Cascio who says she will forward my case to a supervisor. This is the first hope I've had in 7 days.I have filed cases with both credit cards and am proceeding to leave negative reviews on every travel site and social media available.  The short version of the story is this: I booked a trip which cost $1004.88. Upon receiving ""confirmation of order"" (not tickets, mind you), I noticed the wrong return date.  Per the directions in the ""Help"" section of the <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> web site, I replied and requested cancellation so I could rebook properly.  <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> replied promptly, offered two choices for refund--back to my credit card which could take 3-5 days or refund to <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> account, which could be used immediately  I chose the latter.  I immediately rebooked tickets which cost $1195.88.  I clicked the button to use the credit of $1004.88, which made the outstanding balance $191 (charge for different return date.) I tried to use same credit card but got error message, so I used a different one for the $191.00.  I then see that both cards were charged full amount.  One, for $1004.88 and one for $1195.88.  I begin contacting <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>. I then begin a series of auto-reply emails that never address the issue and begin with ""this will take 3-5 days to research"" to ""it will take 10-14 days to research."" Fifteen emails later, I call the emergency number, speak to a human, who promises resolution. I truly hope they can get this resolved. This is unconscionable to charge someone over $1000 twice for same trip. I will update if and when this gets resolved."
5	I have bought a flight from Skypicker and some questions came to my mind. The assistant named Valery assisted me with the most clear information. She instantly helped me and I had no problems with anything. I am very greatfull for your such an amazing assistants. Now my holidays are planned perfectly with Valery's help. :)
5	We are group 7 people from Czech Republic and we had 6 flight during 5 days around Europe (Brusel, Dublin, Lisabon, Roma, Bonn, Prag). Reservations, purchase price, check-in, communication = everything was perfect. Thanks for your work, we will sure use your services in the futureThank
4	I got to skypicer by chance as I was looking for cheap flights to get home. They have offer the best combinations (as I had to change a flight) which saved me lots of time. Also, they did the check in for me and just send me the boarding pass.
5	Amazing service, cannot fault it: got a quick response to my query via FB, and the lady on a phone was very helpful. The flight I booked was with 5 stops but Skypicker managed it very well and sent me the confirmation within minutes. Highly recommend them to anyone planning a complicated trip.
5	I reciewed an answer whitin 20 minutes, that's what I Call very good service. Thanks :smiley:
5	"As a frequent traveller of many european airlines, I ""saw it all"" and nothing could surprise me. Skypicker met my high expectations. We had no bad surprises and I absolutely loved that Skypicker made an online check-in on my behalf."
5	I've made a mistake and entered some wrong info, Fahd was nice and helped me to change that info. 5* for Fahd, he was very responsive.
5	Joao was very efficent and pleasant when my flight was delayed by Thai Air. He assured me that the problem would be rectified & called me back as I was roaming and confirmed booking promptly. Ver Good Service Both Personally & Professionally.I will be using you again and recommending you to friends and colleagues.Many Thanks Simon Thomas
5	I had a few issues by not receiving my boarding pass and both Adrian and Samael did their utter most to answer all my questions and provide me with excellent service in a heart beat! Can't recommend them enough!
5	VERY KIND AND HELPFULL WITH GOOD MOOD BY LENKA!
5	Found this company amazing ! Booking was done seamlessly , our check in was done for us and the documentation forwarded to us . When I needed to add a suitcase to the booking , the most patient gentleman called Jura helped me while I changed my mind 3 times about what I wanted and how I wanted it done. He sorted everything out for me in the kindest most efficient way.Would definitely use them again. !Thank you for such a pleasant experience!
5	My original plan was to leave Reykjavik to Geneva, via Barcelona before the new year. But due to 18 hours of delay in my first flight, I was going to miss my second flight from Barcelona to Geneva. I panicked, as I was not ready for this long delay, at this time of the year, when I should be having a wonderful new year's eve at sweet home. The airline provided all the passengers an overnight staying at the nearby hotel, but I couldn't call the airline service for changing my flight schedule. Thanks to <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>, Michal H. and Šárka, I was able to contact airline company, yet to find that they denied to take charge of missing my second flight and another overnight accomodation at thr Barcelona. Michal was a lifesaver for me, as he provided me with new itinerary with no additional cost! Šárka has also helped me a lot to book my new second flight, and I am more than satisfied with the services received from both of them! Kiwi's chat system was very useful for travellers like me who had limited access for calling international call. I would highly recommend <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> for others and for my next trip! Thank you so much for saving my last day of the year with huge smile and comfort in scheduling! You were my last luck in year 2016!
5	I was looking for a flight with Air Asia and had some concerns with the baggage weight. The customer service offered a nice and very quick support chat to help me with my questions. Martin K. was very nice and found the answer to my question. Thanks for the great help. Now I can book my next trip without any concerns.
1	I was led to believe that I was going to have a good experience because of all the good reviews..but this is by far one of the worst companies I have ever used. If I could give them no stars I absolutely would in a heartbeat. They are unorganized and take days in order to respond. They do not listen and when I made a complaint instead of being understanding the representative was rude. Although the mistake (the reason for my calling in the first place) is no one's fault but my mine own, I would have expected  customer service to be understanding with solutions.

5	can´t wait to be on board. thanks for the awesome services skypicker
5	Mr Mario helped me getting the tickets on the proper mail address, since I wrote it badly during booking procedure.... fast and professional, keep up the good job guys!
1	Absolute worst customer service, and very misleading on their website!
5	I would like to thank Mr. Martin Ch. for his great customer service. Wish you all the best!
5	Great value and good booking process.
4	5 stars for NEIL CAMILLERI from Malta . In online chat , he was very courteous , charming and helpful . He gave me the feeling of an exclusive Customer and that my request was taken very seriously . Please honor him why he has earned it.One star deduction due to the telephone contact with someone else before I chose the chat . I had to wait a long time and the agent was not very helpful . I had to coax her all the answers and my request not really seemed to be interested
5	I was surprised that all was working like this. Very fast confirming with all Documents and finally easy to use... very nice experience... welcome to 21th century... (thumbsup)thank you
5	I have of course read some horror stories on flight bookings from Expedia, Bookings and so on, so I was a bit afraid of using <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> having never heard of it. But after, I read that it's a start-up which had been doing well so it diminished my fear a little.Fast-forwarding it to experience, I think it's one of the best I have ever received! After booking, clear details were sent to me, and to enquire on some doubts, the phone was picked up almost instantaneously and I was able to speak to someone and this is a big value add especially for us doing businesses from the other part of the world.We were automatically checked-in for some flights and e-mail reminders were sent at times where we think was most appropriate. This is another part which I liked most.All in all, I am very impressed by <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> and it's service level and I hope the young team can continue to provide us, the consumers, with good service and add value to the tourism industry.I hope the company thrive and as you get bigger, always remember that value-adding to your clients are the most important.Many thanks to the team at <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>, I am very happy with your services!
5	Thank you. Really nice and polite . Clear all
1	So  disappointed....booked a ticket already in Mars from Umea to Ljubljana with a stopover at Arlanda, received e-tickets and confirmation immediately, yesterday they resend the e-tickets.  We left Umea without problem, so the first flight went well but I'm Stockholm we found out that it was not existing any flight to Ljubljana, we were stucked at the airport. SAS in collaboration with Adria helped out with hotel and new tickets, but Skypicker left us behind. Obvious Skypicker had been informed already for more than a week a ago about the cancelled route,  that Adria doesn't have direct flights from Sweden any longer, but Skypicker didn't contacted us. What kind of company is did if you can't trust them ? How could they send us e-tickets of an non existing flight ?
5	I missed a long haul flight and was facing paying for an extortionate ticket for the next flight. Kiwi offer great deals on connecting shorter flights together, allowing me to get home the next day for a reasonable price. I also used the online chat service with a lady called Olga, she was really helpful and kind. This website is outstanding and the customer service is really fantastic.
5	Kiwi helped me a lot, especially Veronika Smidova, who was so helpful regarding my flight reservation and baggage issues. I bought a ticket with baggage, but baggage wasnt added at firts and flighting company wrote me, that I do not have any, but Veronika added baggage for me and saved the trip. Her quick action saved my reservation. Thank you Veronika and <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>!

5	It was helpful to have direct chat with agent Nizar. The agent helped me with changing flights and finding the cheapest option :)
5	Easy booking process, 24/7 customer service who are quick to reply and more than happy to help, especially from Jan Lukasek on the live chat & Cintia Schelbauer via e-mail/phone.Would definitely use again when looking for flights.
5	I had problems to do my check in online and I used the Online Chat where I spoke to Agent Eva and she was very helpftul and attentious. Thank you Eva!
5	I feel so happy of this service. I had a problem with my flight because I wrote wrong my email adress and personal information so I didn´t get email confirmation (I realized the day before of my flight, trying to go back home for Christmas).Lukas was so nice and so kind to me and he did all his best in order to help me that I only can say thank you. The best CIA investigator I have never seen. He could solve the problem after trying hardly for a long time. always believing waht I told, and always making all the efforts necessary for helping. Thank you again Lukas. I told you, and I tell you now again, you have saved my Christmas.
5	Jiri was very helpful and open to any of my questions. Its good to know there are agents like this
5	Support is fast and very responsive.I had few issues with my boarding pass and flight which got resolved quickly.I would like to thank Nino K. for fast response in solving my queries
5	Thank you Simon for great help in changing my flight! Very efficient and polite service.
5	Lukas helped me when i had several questions must say i travel alot and he is def, the best out there
5	My wife had a wrong name on the flight Ticket and <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> helped us All the Way so we diddent have to talk to the Airline
4	"This is the first time i've used Skypicker, and i must say i am not sure how i haven't done it before.The website is incredibly intuitive, and suitable both for leisure traveling (showing you prices at a glance, if you don't have a fixed destination), and business travel, if you want to book something quickly.Some cons for me were the lack of ability to pay with American Express, and a strange flow where i picked a flight that at the checkout said ""the price was increased by the carrier""But above all - I absolutely love the customer service. I made a small mistake in the booking and they were on it within minutes. they contacted both airlines for me and took care of everything. Amazing."
4	I had some questions about the different trip insurance options and confirming the possibility of making my rather short connecting time through Dubai. Jan in the US explained things very nicely and helped me to understand. I look forward to a great trip. Thank you!
4	I booked a ticket from Newcastle UK to PHX AZ, at a significant cost savings.  VItaliy N, was very helpful in answering my questions about adding checked bags, managing passport information.  I would recommend them to anyone traveling short notice on a budget.
3	After problems with getting to the airport with my friend and being told we only have 1 checked bagged and I had to pay the additional fee for the other bag, even though I had proof of purchase they refused to take the bag without further payment. I contacted skypicker and they were very apologetic and have sorted out a refund which should be coming any day now. Yulia K was very helpful is s extremely annoying situation.
2	Dear. SkypickerGuys, I tried to buy ticket from Skypicker today, however...there are too many bad reviews with detailed information how these many people felt scammed.Many bad reviews sound like having problem in refund and wrong flight booking orSkypicker forces people to pay more... well.. this is what I can think of after reading more than half the reviews.I do not think, it is a good decision to buy a ticket from here. Sorry Skypicker, seems like you guys to fix a lot on company management. Hopefully for the next time I need to book a ticket, reviews become much better to convince me using ur website.
5	I am satisfied with skypicker service. I was worrying about luggage then Mr kojo A helped me very well.Thanks for his services.
5	Good experience. Bek was polite and helpful. I'll use the website again :)
5	As I did not receive an e-mail with confirmation of my flights, neither I could log in with my booking number to check my flights there, I used the chat option. Short description of my problem, and Olga from the customer service / helpdesk chat helped quickly solve my problem. Very professional - short and relevant questions and initiative in solving the problem. I got the confirmation by e-mail and also a direct link to a printable version of my flight bookings. And a wish for a wonderful day :)
2	Now I feel terrible bad with Norwegian airline. you arrange for us yesterday in Bangkok over 5hours delayed and that airline did not take responsible to miss the plane from Copenhagen to GenevaSkypicker arrange for us to fly Copenhagen to London ..London -to Geneva but My son could not fly because of he is not allow for transit ..everything .
5	A very good service! Just had a chat with a very helpful woman (yulia) and she helped me with my problem(s). Thank you!
5	Had an excellent experience with the company rep. Tomas L. was very helpful, friendly, and thorough when assisting me on some corrections of my booking. I would use this company again.
3	NOT JUST UNDERRATED BUT UNDERSERVICED AND FUCKT UP
4	Initially confusing booking details regarding checked in baggage and on board transatlantic food services but after talking to Jan she sorted everything out very quickly and put my mind at ease. Great service.
5	After a very stressful day with my flight being cancelled and a lack of communication and extremely poor customer service from Air India, it was refreshing to receive such fantastic customer service provided by Adam Jelinek. He reassured me that Kiwi would take care of arranging alternative flights so I can (hopefully) make it to my brothers wedding! I will definitely be recommending Kiwi to friends and family from now on! A huge thanks to you guys.
5	Thank you for the excellent service and always very helpful during a stressful process and was always quick to reply to any emails or questions I had! I will recommend you to everyone�����
5	I have a spelling error on my brother-in-law's passport Jan is straight on to the airline to rectify the mistake and also to arrange wheel chair access on  the flight for him.Thankyou Jan appreciate your immediate help.

5	Marketa was very pleasant and professional, as well as very obliging in explaining the details of flight booking.
2	"I had a bad experience with this company.I purchased 2 ticket from Milan Bergamo to Keflavik (Iceland).On the way back, the route was Keflavik -> Cologne and Cologne -> Milan Bergamo, the first flight was 2 hours late so we lost the connection for Milan Bergamo.I contacted their customer service immediately and they told me that in 30 minutes I would have been recontacted for alternative flight to Milan Bergamo. After 45 minutes I called the customer service again (since I received no calls) and asked for solutions and I also proposed alternative destinations (Bologna or Verona). The customer service told me to wait.After maybe 20 minutes they finally called me saying no solutions were found and that they offered me a refund (they offered the double of the price paid for the flight Cologne-Milan Bergamo).First, they did not offer me a solution but just a refund. I needed to come home and there was alternatives (train, buses or even flights in fact later I purchased 2 new tickets for the next Ryanair flights departing at 21.40 for 200€), but they did not propose me that alternatives (even if some of them were expensive). I can understand that the price of a flight purchased the same day could be expensive but they could at least advise me. They could warn me about the high price of the next flights available (there were multiple solutions), and so I could arrange by myself, proposing later the possibility of a refund. As Article 4 of their Terms & Conditions states ""In case We are unable to find a reasonable alternative Flight(s) or other means of transportation due to a disproportionate price difference between the potential alternative transportation and the original price for the unused Flights, we may agree with You on Our proportional contribution to the costs associated with a mutually agreed alternative transportation. ""They did NOT propose alternative transportation.Second, they miscalculated the refund since they offered me the double of the price I originally paid for that flight and they said that the price was 41 € (circa), so they offered me 82 € (circa). But that's not correct because I also purchased a checked baggage and on Ryanair flight the price for a checked baggage is 25,50 €. So the correct refund is (41 + 25,50)*2 = 133 €.I will try to avoid this company for my next trips.Maybe they are good on prices but they are bad in customer service.Andrea"

5	I used the live chat option and talked to Mary and Olga C, who were very reactive and promised to help me further.

Thank you for that! :)

5	The customer service is really good and reliable. I would recommend this company to anyone looking for a safe company to buy its plane tickets.
1	Skypicker sent me an email with boarding passes for the hometrip, the day after I left my home country. They had earlier promised it one day before. There was an attatched pdf with boarding passes to print, but we had no printer on the journey. The was no info regarding what to do, if I could not print, so I assumed it could be solved in the airport (Luton, Ryanair), if I arrived early. In the airport there was no possibility to check in online or print the pdf from my phone, and at the Ryanair office, I had to pay 60 GBP to get the four boarding passes printed.I have tried to get some kind of refund from Skypicker, but they politely write to me, that they apologize, but just says that I should print it before I left Denmark. But thats pretty difficult, when they send it the day after.I would expect some kind of refund, plus a promise to send more informative emails to other customers, so they don't get the same experience.Instead I got a lot of sorry's, but they are not recieved in my bank...

1	"In the middle of a booking Skypicker certainly raised the price of the tickets with 70 €.. I instant reseached the tickets on momondo and they still had the initail price... So I restarted the ticket purchase incognito and the price was low again! It seems very strange that Skypicker raise the price on ""locked"" tickets... But this is of course an easy way to trick extra money from the costumers.. SHAME ON YOU!Afterwards the Skypicker rejected my credit card 2 times for no reason and the site went down several times... so I had to type in all information on the additional passenger over and over again. The site is very slow and buggy.."
5	I had clicked a link which showed a 17 hour flight, but after booking it had said 40! I called and spoke with Lucie F. immediately to cancel the booking, she understood my issue immediately and was an excellent communicator. Considering the time of the year, Lucie saved my holiday so I'm very grateful. I rebooked with Kiwi on the desired flight thereafter, mostly because of my experience with your customer service :)
5	The booking was smooth and affordable, and having multiple legs of international travel coordinated under a single booking was extremely helpful. Communication was excellent.
5	I mistakenly put in the wrong email address when booking my flight. Tamara called and left me a voice mail message the same day. I contacted customer service the next day via live chat and got right in touch with Tamara. My problem was resolved immediately. Thanks!
5	When I booked the ticket through Skypicker I had made a spelling mistake in my name. Through the web chat service Skypicker could fix the issue and I highly recommend their service to anyone.  Special thanks to Emre T. who resolved the issue for me.Thanks,Lino
5	Vally was awesome. The speed at which he solved my flight issue was so impressive, really sets the bench mark when it comes to customer service! His colleagues should probably take a leaf out of his book, remarkable!
5	The agent AVID was very helpfull and very polite . thank you
1	I haven't even taken the flight yet so who knows if that will go without hiccup but as of now, by the time one pays for luggage, another luggage charge on the connection, seat allocation, fee to sit both tickets, booked and bought together, next to each other, it really isn't a discounted flight anymore. And the hassle is not worth it. I talked to customer service who said they would e-mail me with links to pay for allocated seating. I didn't get the email. Contacted them again, they said I would get the e-mail within the hour. I received it next day or two days after (not the hugest of deals but still). When I read the seat allocation, it was nothing like what I had explained I wanted which was a window and middle seat together throughout the flight and connection flight. I have finally gotten ahold of another customer service representative who is allocating my seats and sending me an email payment link. The price is different than the first quote I received. That sketches me out. The customer rep ended chat without asking if there was anything I needed. Still haven't gotten the email for a link to pay for allocated seating. Nothing makes me madder than poor customer service and that is exactly what is going on. I will never ever ever book with this company again. I understand discount flights come with less luxury but I'm starting to think it isn't worth it. By the time the charges all add up, I mine as well have bought a regular flight with better amenities and less hassle. I'm hoping the flight goes well,  but I highly doubt it.
5	Lucia (from the live chat) was very helpful! I booked a flight and accidentally made a mistake so I wanted to cancel it, she quickly guided me, hassle-free and now I just have to wait for the refund and I can book another flight with no worries. Thanks for your help, Lucia!
1	I made a booking and accidentially entered the wrong details which i take full responsibility for. However, I saw on the website and terms that you can change details within 48 hours. In order to ensure I was within the 48 hours I contacted them immediately on the morning of Friday 20th January 2017. I am currently in Thailand and asked for them to call me back. The female calller called me back and explained I needed to send photo copies of our passports to an email given. She explained that we needed to wait for 4 hours for kiwi to contact the airlines and get back to us. 4 to 5 hours later no update or information given. We then called later Friday evening and was told we needed to wait till the next day as no confirmation had been given from the airlines. On Saturday 22nd we called in the morning as we still hadn't received any update. We were told by a female caller that one Airline had confirmed however the other had not and we had to wait. She advised us to wait another four hours! We waited for 6 hours and still no update, email or phonecall. We called back Saturday evening and was informed by another female caller that neither airline had confirmed and asked us to send copies of passport again. We declined and explained that this had already been done. She explained she would need to speak with her manager to resolve the issue. She advised us to wait for the next day. It is now Sunday 22nd and in the morning we received a call from a supervisor called Jim Razor who apologised for all the inconvenience and explained that kiwi were still waiting for confirmation from the airlines. He explained that they had contacted the airlines and they had our new details but hadn't confirmed to kiwi. He explained he would contact us and we requested a phone call rather than email. We requested even an update would be nice as we are flying on Wednesday 26th January. He also advised us to contact the airlines! Afterwards I realised this wasn't for us to do, it should be kiwi as they offer the 48 hours change service! We waited for 5 hours for an update but heard nothing. We contacted kiwi again and asked to speak with the supervisor as he advised in the conversation in the morning. We were told that he was busy and he would call us back. Few hours later we heard nothing. We decided then to contact one airline via telephone and they changed the details for us immediately. They explained they had heard nothing from <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> and would send them an email to confirm. After this we found a kiwi chat online service. We spoke with a male member of staff called Marek. We explained the situation and that we wanted to speak with the supervisor. He said this was not possible as the supervisor was busy. We also informed Marek we had contacted one of the airlines ourselves. Marek explained that neither airline company had confirmed yet and he would call us to give us an update either way. During the chat we received an email around 14.55pm with an update! We have not heard anything back and it's now 18.30pm. We then used another online chat with the other airline. They changed our details via the chat. They also explained they had no request from <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> and advised us to contact them. It is now 18.30pm and still not heard anything from the supervisor or the last caller even with an update. Altogether we have spent nearly 100 euros to make the calls to this company. I think it's bad to offer a service and not provide it, this includes the customer having to resolve the problems themselves. It's also unlikely that some compensation will be offered. This is a lengthy complaint I am aware but hopefully highlights the companies lack of communication and reliability. This includes providing awareness to others to prevent them from going through this ridiculous situation.
5	Lucie, just helped me and she was very helpful and made sure all my concerns were answered.
1	If I could give this company 0 stars, I would. Horrible customer service. I have now tried to book a flight for myself and two family members from LA to London and my payment won't go through, for the 22nd time. I've called my bank and they said that the mailing addresses don't match.... ---But nowhere, at any point in time, have I been offered to enter in my postal address details. I have only been asked for passenger names, birthdays, email addresses, phone numbers, credit card numbers, expiry dates, and name as it appears on card. Nowhere, did it ask me for a mailing address or billing address.So, I don't know what you're doing on your end, Kiwi, but fix it FAST!You may have cheap flights, but your customer service is horribly appalling, no one knows what's going on, I've spoken to 3 managers and no one can seem to help me due to 'security issues.' I understand that, but when has a travel company not been able to book over the phone?!?!FIX IT. and FIX IT FAST.I WANT to book a flight with you, but I guess I'm going to have to find another provider to book flights with because your customer service is scary...
5	The user experience for Skypicker is amazing. If you don't have a specific place you'd like to land, or are just looking for the cheapest flight into the country. Skypicker's interface provides a great birds eye view of the geographical map.Pre-reservation service (live chat)I was responded to on the live chat very promptly. The replies are sometimes not instantaneous with a 5-8 minutes wait, but that is all good considering I don't have to pick up to phone to call.Post-reservation serviceAfter making the payment, my ticket was book in the matter of minutes. My itinerary was sent to me and i'm all set to go.
1	THE WORST BOOKING FLIGTH COMPANY EVER! THE WORST EXPERIENCE BUYING FLIGTHS WITH THEM. IT'S HORRIBLE.
1	I was so excited to find these tickets. I had found two tickets from Seville to LA for $918. I booked the tickets and paid for them. As soon as I got the confirmation is stated they were charging me $991 and my flights were leaving Barcelona!!! I called them multiples times where I was told they would call me back within 12hours, but no one actually ever called me. They emailed me and tried to charge me to change my flight even though I send the screenshot of what I was booking. Everyone is so rude and don't understand that they made the mistake!! I was so nice and understanding at the beginning. I travel a lot and am so disappointed about their customer service. I looked up the company afterwards and saw that it used to be called skypicker and was a huge scam! Stay away from them!!!
4	It consists of excellent employees who are kind and helpful. They care about their customers and they work 24 hours in 24 hours. They are fast and efficient. Personally, they worked for me directly, without hesitation, to anything I'd need.  They care about check - in and boarding pass. They send it to you via email. And you are ready for a safe - nice trip! Bon voyage!& Remember: Travel is the only thing you buy that makes you richer!!
4	Wanted an alternate flight and they gave a quick solution. Price was a concern but happy with their help from Waqar. Will use your site for future bookings for sure
5	Was contacted by Pavel Fridrich from Skypicker minutes after sending an email and issue was resolved promptly. Great customer support.
5	I would like to thank Michael Angelo for his kind assistance with getting my problem - cancellation refund - resolved. Michael was very friendly and helpful.Thanks once more!
4	@skypickercom €30 higher than booking direct
1	Recommend all strongly advised to not book tickets from this company because of poor service and because it exposes customers for additional unforeseen expenses!
5	Very good chat support to help you checking in!
5	One of the best travelling websites. Amazing rates and an outstanding customer service. I had a problem with my e-ticket. My last name was spelled twice. I contacted customer services through the chat and LENKA was so helpful. She got my problem fixed with in minutes. I would recommend this website to all my family and friends
3	@hbaskas There's one way to get holiday travel deals all year through: the Skypicker fareseeker. Savings over 50%! <https://t.co/QYnrvEvebG>
5	Followed through with good service, calling back quickly with important information.  Babak was the person helping me.
5	Had a issue which was resolved very swiftly by agent Zuzanna S
1	Left with no money, and travel plans for new years eve. Bought 4 tickets to go from Moscow to Prague on the 30th December, after 10 hours they cancell the order and give options for a refund, which takes from 3 to 10 days! Besides that I have no longer the options that I had when buying these tickets, I am left without money to buy any other tickets now! Why do they charge my card when they have not verified the flights?! So basically I have lost the possibility to travel to Prague, and also have to pay a fine to the hotel that we reserved since we cannot cancel fully. Anybody who wants to to gamble go to a casino instead, the odds are higher than if you buy a flight through <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com>
5	I don't like everything about this site but the help I got from Eric was very good
5	very good service and and so much helpful i like it ;)
5	I am so glad I booked through skypicker. There was a flight delay flying to Kuala Lumpur and missed connecting flight to Phuket. I contacted skypicker and they sorted tickets on the next flight. And no extra charge because of there guarantee. So a big 5 out of 5 for me. Thank you Skypicker you made what could have been a really bad situation a breeze.
5	Amazing! Irina V. Responded within seconds and was able to help change my travel documents and make my trip worry free! Thank you!!
5	I really appreciated the help i got from Bachana Kuprashvili. Thanks alot!
4	Received a really good and prompt service. I give 4 stars because I had some problems while paying online with my bank card, still don't know why.I thank a lot Jan Lukášek because he's been really helpful and kind via chat after my flight has been cancelled.
3	Skypicker Valentine's promo: €10 off coupon for flights! <https://t.co/WU8udWmnkx> #fly4free
4	I am satisfied of the services wich I got from Daniela Demeterova. Thanks Skypicker for god service.
5	Merci beaucoup à Jérome  pour ce super service client !  Je le recommande vivement !
5	first time i use support and i have to say its been great !! quick respond and courtesy !!i want to say spacial thanks to Pavel Fridrich for your help .
5	@kiwicom247 i understand :) what amuses me is that u have a 3rd party who will have to verify my payment but they are not avilable nxt ~17hr
4	And a major thanks goes to Barbora Tomkova who has booked my flights without additional costs. Thank you!
1	Me and my BF had been stuck in the airport in Manila for more than 5 hours! We purchased the ticket coming back home to Hawaii Mar. 22nd, we were not notify and clearly advise on the phone by our customer service to have a Visa with us if we are going to Australia as lay over! I have actually called them 5x to upgrade our luggage, and no one reminded us! What kind of customer service is that?! They basically rob us with our $1,411 plane ticket fare and extra money we paid for luggage upgrade for $450 NOT one Penny is back in our pocket! We understand no refund policy, but at least try to resolve the problem by helping us book into another airlines like Jetstar and Philipines Airlines that does not require AU Visa! Or give our money back even if you have to take 10-20% fee! Please don't book with this company! And if you are the supervisor working for this company at least change your policy! What a robber!!! Shame on you!!! Not a customer service type at all!!! Not recommending it!
4	henry the operetor is great !!!!!!! the best one , he help me in my checkin
5	Excellent and very quick service by Martin Carter. Thank you very much for your all help. Ugur Yilmaz
1	Due to delays from Catania airport in Italy, we missed our connecting flight in London, and therefore Skypicker had to re-book a new flight... Which they did, BUT they did not manage to get us home to Denmark before 35 hours later, and we had to stay 1 night in London and 1 night in Stockholm. It would have been faster to drive or take the train!!Everytime we talked to their support-team about our situation, we got hold of a new person to assist us, who promised to get back to us within an hour. They never did, except 1 out of 6 time... Everytime we had to call them back, and start explaining it all over again to a new support-person. Tiresome!Moreover they did only refund the 2 extra nights in a hotel, and NOT the trainticket from Gatwick to Stansted (had to change airport for our newly booked flight), nor anything for the fact that we had to take 1 extra day off work.We will NEVER chose this agency again and CANNOT recommend anybody to use them. They are not service-minded nor reliable.All in all, a terrible experience.
5	I stumbled across this site when travelling abroad and I have not once looked back. They really strive to make things simple and super user friendly. Now that I am home, I continue to use the site and I'm astonished that they have managed to outdo themselves in terms of customer service. Quick response times, 24/7 agents available to answer any queries and my favourite, they actually follow through with the required actions.I love this site it makes travelling so easy.
5	After the attacks in Brussels the world in Belgium was upside down and nobody knew exactly what to do. There was a lot of misinformation about what was happening and if the flights would be cancelled or not. Also at Skypicker originally  the support desk didn't know exactly what was happening and what should be done. But after some on line chats I got in contact with Eleonora N. and she just helped me extraordinary well. The support was clear, friendly and very helpful. After requesting that the info was transmitted by phone, Eleonora N. kept me informed every time there was a change.Skypicker also provided new tickets without charging me any extra money.They were absolutely friendly and helpful and the next time I must fly I certainly will order again by <http://Skypicker.com|Skypicker.com>!!!Thank you so much for helping me out!!!With kind regards,Vladimir
5	Jana dealt with my enquiry swiftly and followed-up with an email with further instructions. I was calling from the UK and so her speedy actions were much appreciatedThank you Jana!
5	I had to add checked luggage in last minute and Daniele (Levori(?))save me the huge at airport costs! Many thanks!!
5	Great assistance by Natalya
5	i got help from a really nice representative, very patient and kind, named Anna.Thank you!
5	Great agent (Julia) who worked it out very quick, thanks!No more painful and large calls.
3	Im only putting good because its not the best flight as I have so many connections and I cant check in luggage without a very high cost and even if I chose that route I would have to re check at each airport which is pretty lame. But the price was correct ! Also my itinirary schedule changed twice but not drastically so everything is cool !On top of that the 24/hr online help was very good and Marius was super helpful and answered all my questions right away ! =)
5	I'm a lady with a lot of questions and Anastassia ., johana y Radim and another Miss I will love to remember the name where really helpful with me :D excelent service
5	I am writing this review to share with other costumers our experience with Kiwi and the real people that are there to support clients every step of the way. On our way back from our family vacation in Europe, we had the experience of missing our connection in London to LAX because of bad weather. We knew that because Kiwi works with different airlines we would have to purchase a new ticket to cover the leg missed, something that was clear to us initially when we booked our very inexpensive flights with Kiwi. But we were not left up to ourselves to find the tickets for our second leg missed. Sabina from Kiwi called me to my cel phone as soon as we landed to remind us of the Kiwi guarantee, which is that they cover up to double the price of the tickets when a flight is missed in the circumstances that we had. She assured me that she was there to personally assist me in finding the best possible tickets to cover the missed leg, and to find me a hotel if needed. Sabina worked tirelessly with me for several hours until she was able to find a flight that satisfied our needs. She was articulate with her English, was resourceful, polite, patient, supportive, professional, and kind, as she listened to my every question and concern, offering solutions along the way. I felt cared for and supported in the hectic moments when we had not idea how we would get back home and when. She stood by us every step of the way, calling us back and forth several times until all the details were arranged, including tickets home and overnight stay in London. I am happy to say that we were more than satisfied with Kiwi, because they stood by their guarantee, paying double the amount of the initial ticket's price, and promising to reimburse our hotel night stay. If you are considering using Kiwi, just be aware that in order to provide cheap prices they do have to work with and use different airlines for the different legs of the trip, but they will stand by you and support you should you have any problems during your trip. In my case there was always a real person in the other side, and it never took more than 30 seconds to have somebody to talk to when I dialed costumer service whether in the US or in other countries. Thank you Sabina!
4	I flew from Bucharest, Romania to London. I needed a flight at short notice. I tried the usual - ebookers, cheapflights, <http://booking.com|booking.com>, and airline sights themselves, but Skypicker gave me the cheapest option by quite a distance. I was at first shocked at the low cost of the flight and couldn't believe it.The user experience was also good, as I was flying Ryanair and one of the key customer complaints is that if they do not print off a boarding pass before flying, the passengers have ti pay extra - but Skypicker kept telling me I had to do this and sent me the boarding passes, which means they were making the small print in the ticket conditions large, which was most welcome. Also no hidden costs.
5	while searching for calendar implementation, checked out the tickets on #skypicker and available rooms on #airbnb
4	Merry Christmas to whole Skypicker team as well! :)
5	Thanks, Alikhan Ramazanov! Helped out quickly and efficiently––and a wonderful email follow-up!
1	They are thief as when i booked tickets from UAE to Indonesia they book for me 3 tickets from UAE to India and from India to Malaysia then Malaysia to Indonesia and they showed as they are transit (2 stops) but after i reach Airport to check in they requested the visa for India and Malaysia  which of course you don't need if these are stops but the confirmation tickets which i received them after payment they put additional terms and conditions which not appear before booking and they knows we will not focus on this so i talked with their agent Kayak web site in the airport but he said you had been faced fraud as this third company will take your money if you didn't travel but if you travelled the airlines will take your money. i contact the Head office in England, they are all bastards! they are stealing money and they destroy my trip. Please don't deal with them.
1	They did check in before making sure I did not have any additional luggage or carry on. I had to pay 110$ for adding my others luggage AT THE COUNTER which is twice the online price (during check in) since they did it for me!!! I do not recommend this company at all!
3	A multi-destination trip generated by Kiwi caused me to miss the second flight. After providing all evidence to Kiwi's customer service, I never heard back from them. It was only after I got in touch with them on Facebook that I managed to get a refund, but not without a heated argument.Overall, I obtained satisfaction but I would recommend listening to your customers and doing the investigative work before starting to argue against their case.Thank you.
5	Very quick responses and very cooperative, polite and professional, especially from Mohamed Abdelkader. Now I have no worries about my flight!
5	Filled in the wrong information while checking in. Called the number and was helped by Vally. He was very helpful and resolved the issuea in no time.
5	The feedback is so fast when I asked for an itinerary, it is an excellent experience.Dear Linda,thank you for booking with us.The eTicket that I have sent you above is a complete itinerary for the flight. We don’t have any other documents that would serve as an itinerary as this is the only one that we provide to our passengers.Thank you for your comprehension.Best RegardsLydie BuckovaTravel Consultant<http://Skypicker.com|Skypicker.com>
5	I fly a lot, and usually simply book my own flights directly with the airlines. This is the first time I have used a company such as Kiwi and I am extremely pleased with the service. In brief, my flight schedule was changed twice by one of the airlines in a 2-leg journey, but Kiwi made accommodations each time so that my connecting flights still worked out. Thanks especially to Jaroslav for arranging the second change, and so close to the busy holiday period.
5	Their customer support was very good. I had an issue with a delayed check-in, but Tamara solved my issue in just a few minutes and I got my boarding pass on time.
5	Anastasia F helped med out in a proper way, when I couldn't add baggage on webpage
5	Great online assistance! So fast to respond and helpful!
4	First time booking and would use again. Got a very cheap flight. No complaints from me
5	Nothing to complain about, quick booking, good interface, perfect timings with communications.
5	Simon helped me correct the information on my reservation. It was fast and easy!
5	I had some questions of my flight schedule and I used the Chat Box and talked with the Agent Sabi J. He was really helpful and friendly, so I trust in the service. I recommend the use of Chat.
5	I'm so glad that I found Skypicker, it's amazing app for cheapest tickets, thats the easiest way to find tickets to any place I want to go, I'll definitely keep using skypicker
4	The help service to change my booked by DARIA (the service lady ) was very very helpful and quick . I would recommend Skypicker to every one and especially  there help service . My new best friend  now.
3	Firstly, I would like to compliment Mary P, who was the first point of contact via the international phone call that we have made when we missed the connecting flight. It is due to the flight delay from our previous flight from Puerto Princesa to Manila. She has the patience and empathy to empathize with our dire situation we are in. I would also like to thank her for being able to solve the problem at the 3rd phone call and get us onto the earliest next flight from Manila to Singapore. If it weren't for her, we would be stranded in the airport for a longer duration. That being said, we are also very disappointed and appalled at the HORRIBLE experience we had with the 2nd customer service agent (I did not managed to get the name). We made a 2nd call as we did not receive any callback after the 1st phone call. I have to waste another 5-10 min explaining my dire situation to her which I did not receive any empathy and was even rude towards us. It did not help especially when the investigation was not properly investigated as the flight was delayed for more than 2 hrs instead of just 5 min as claimed on the website. I WOULD NOT have made the international calls if it was only a 5 min delay with exorbitant phone bills at the end of the day and receiving such lousy services from the 2nd customer service agent. Please do refer to the original Flight timing for our flight with Cebu Pacific below: 1700 hrs departure from Puerto Princesa, 1850 hrs arrival at Manila.After the delay: 1840 hrs departure from Puerto Princesa, 2030 hrs arrival at ManilaThe connecting flight was at 2100 hrs. Please do note that if we had landed as per the original timing, we would have ample time to catch our flight instead of spending time and money as well as effort to keep explaining to the customer service agents. The 2nd operator i spoke to totally not interested to listen and understand our plight but rather, trying to dismiss us. This is seriously bad customer service. I have already told her that i'm calling via international phone call and it is costly and we are desperate for help. She insisted that we are the one at fault as Cebu Airlines claims to be delayed for 5 mins and we should have landed on 1855 hrs and would still have been able to catch our connecting flight.  Not investigating properly and to pin-point that we are at fault ? Why would we be lying in the first place? After near another 5-10mins trying to resonate with her, she had the audacity to raise her voice, telling me someone will be calling me to follow up on the case. THIS IS DEFINITELY A BIG NO-NO  for a customer service operator. Being a customer service associate myself, I am indeed disappointed and frustrated with such treatment as we should always TRY to understand instead of RAISING our voices.All in all, this whole entire episode has caused me and my friends distress and anxiety not to mention the frustrations we had trying to get back to our country. It had also dampen the mood at the end of the holidays. It was only after Mary P. had called us back and got us on the available earliest flight that the rating was a 3 instead of 1.   Lastly, Please action on the following: 1) Investigate properly with Cebu pacific on the ACTUAL DURATION OF DELAY and an apology from the 2nd phone call operator. I believe we are not the only passengers ON THE SAME FLIGHT. 2) Explain why I have to repeat my situation 3 times when it should have been recorded on the 1st phone call. 3) Reimburse my phone bill for the international calls made. If you are not able to refund me, please do escalate to higher management. I will continue to pursue the matter until the refund is given.  I expect a full refund of my phone bill and a satisfactory answer. Thank you. RegardsNicholas Tay Zhi Yuan Lim Ming Shiang Lim Ming Swin
1	@skypickercom 150 euro = worthless. A voucher for a service I will never use again???
5	Great customer's  services !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4	"This is a positive review of <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>. I booked my flight with them and saved about 25% off the next lowest cost flight. I thought it was worth it! Just gotta be sure to read the fine print if you're using this service (must re-check bags at connections; must order any ""extras"" if you need them - i.e., cabin baggage, checked-baggage, meals, etc..). Also, I'd recommend a minimum layover of 2.5 hours so that you can re-check bags. Couldn't get into my Manage My Bookings page, so I called one of the Customer Reps and she answered my inquiry promptly and politely. I'd recommend. Thanks!"
5	Gabi was really hepful and clear supporting me in finding the answer to my question.
5	Fantastic, excellent and quick service from mr. Patrik Bivoda! So helpful and understanding! He made it possible to change my schedule so I can see my daughter in London a whole day, instead of a few hours:-)
1	Just paid for tickets, but received email without reservation or ticket number, WTF?! First time I see flights confirmation without reservation number.
5	Tamara really help me so much!!!
5	Lukas and Stan were awesome.  Thanks so much!!
5	Tres bon site pour trouver des billets d'avion pas chers.Je recommande vivement.

5	Thank you Ondra Pohl, I got my boarding pass in few seconds in my email and just to make sure that I got it I got a second email
2	Monika, please help. Adding baggage has never been so difficult. I want to add 10kg more for checked baggage from Tokyo - Taipei via Scoot Airlines. You told me that we already have 20 kg bags included for both of us. So we want to add 10kg more for both. Your colleagues sent me a link for payment of upgrading to 25kg? No, I already had 20kg and now I want to add 10kg more. just as simple as that.
4	It's nothing fancy or beyond expectations, but it's cheap and gets the job done painlessly.
4	thank you very much Aura! you did a very good job. thanks for all the info and your kindness.
4	Overall a good service- only problem I had was not getting my return boarding passes sent to me at same time as outward passes, which meant I had to find a printer while I was away.  Not the end of the world but would have preferred all tickets in hand before I left.
5	Skypicker has done well for my family, my uncle just past away and we flew my dad over the following day with 4 different flights and all at low cost. I am happy with the customer service when I needed an enquory about my booking with karen. Thank you. I'll be happy to book a flight in the future with Skypicker.
5	I am thankful that Serhiy resolved my problem. She is patient assisted me coz i am really stresstfull right now at KLIa2 airport coz ive missed my flight last night. Keep it up Serhiy! I believe on you and thanks for the discount ticket. I am hoping sometimes you can give a little advice about transit visa. I think this is always a problem if recheck-in luggage. Again, thanks to Serhiy. Thank you for the free 30 kg check-in luggage. Happy Chinese New Year Everyone!!! Hoping to buy ticket again on your website in the future! ^_^
5	Zuzana S. was just the best help i could get! Really friendly and solved my problem immeadiatelly! Thanks again
5	A bit thanks to Jane S. for quickly and kindly changing my tickets, since I booked the right dates, but wrong monts.
5	Good company, nice website, good customer service, and good feedback!
5	They quickly resolved my request for transferring my checked baggage allowance to my partner and also proactively looked into getting me a refund for my flight, which I hadn't expected I could get.
5	No problems traveling.  Great customer service from Tereza afterwards.
5	My return flight , booked through Skypicker, was only slightly more expensive than one way previously. I did have a long stop over but this was the only negative. I had to add luggage to my flight and this was dealt with cheerfully and efficiently. Moreover I got to speak to an actual person quickly ( that makes a change !)
5	Markéta saved my day, I was quite worried when I called that I had missed something I my booking but she really felt eager to help and still managed to keep me hopeful with constant feedback about what the systems where telling her in (this fells strange to write) fun way. Kind of like a journey towards me getting a hold of my missed booking number. The phone call was way to fun to be a normal customer service call from my end.Thanks Markéta! To both you and Kiwi, have a fantastic day!
5	I booked a flight with <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> a couple months ago from Uganda, Africa, to Los Angeles, California. When it came to departure day I found put that my first flight had been canceled and rescheduled by the airline company. They assured me all other connecting flights would be sorted out. So on the rescheduled day I flew my first flight to Dubai. On arrival I discovered that airlines don't have agreements with eachother and I had lost all connecting flights to the states. I was sent all over the Dubai airport and spent 4 hours trying to plea my case to the two different airline compsnies. Neither would help me and insisted I had to rebook on my own. I had to buy a country simcard and borrow a strangers phone. When I finally reached <http://Kiwi.Com|Kiwi.Com> in Washington DC, over the phone I was a complete wreck! Adam J answered the phone and he was kind and comforting. He assured me that he would get me home. My only regret is that I didn't call customer service earlier. Adam put me on hold and when he got back on the line he had rebooked me on an ever better flight then the original. I wasn't at fault and he was understanding. I reached Los Angeles 4 hours earlier then my first scheduled flight and I was very pleased. I want to personally thank Adam J and Jana S for helping me reach home when I thought I was stuck! My parents are also very appreciative. Thank you for your kind service!
5	Had to leave on the 23rd of Dec 2016 and book at the last minute due to a family emergency. The support provided by Aliaksandra and the booking team was exemplary to say the least. They confirmed my tickets within an hour and helped alleviate the tension of knowing that I will arrive on time to meet my family obligations.
4	I had to change my flights and I luckily got Michal on the LiveChat. He was so easy to chat with, was extremely kind, considerate, calm, and helpful. He explained everything clearly, he double checked things for me, he tried to get be the best deal possible, and he was so nice and personable throughout the whole process. I was very scared, confused, and stressed at the beginning and he made this processes go by smoothly and stress-free. He was the best customer service I have ever had! Thank you so much!
5	Easy and efficience to modify seat or get extra information, Youssef provides to me a very good service, thanks !

5	Their messages are well structured and easy to understand. Their approach is proffesional and they reply to emails fast.
5	Great and quick service of the agent travel agent Elsa. I wishes i have spoken to her earlier since i called the agency in Germany directly t change a different flight. They haven't come back to me ever since, and i had to book a different new flight.Anyways thank you for your quick help!
1	we were traveling from india for our honeymoon to bali,and we booked a flight from India to Bali and skypicker gave us the flight deals where we have 1 stop in Malaysia . we thought as usual like all travel websites its on a single pnr but to our surprise while collecting the boarding pass we came to know that its a different pnr and we need a transit visa . not once have they mentioned that i need a transit visa .. on calling the customer care they say its in the fine print under terms and conditions and they dont have to mention it to the customers.on speaking to the manager he said he will help us out and asked us to wit for 30 min on waiting for more than an hour he said he cant do anything for me and i had no option but to lose my money and cancel my vacation and he would try to get me some refund in the form of taxes which he did not till now.anyways we had to book another flight for next day paying exorbitant prices .sadly there were total of 6 people who booked through skypicker and  all were stranded lost money on hotel and the airticket.i advise costumers go through fare travel agents unlike these scammers.
5	Just booked flights through to Melbourne from Langkawi with Yulia K. Good prices, good services and sales assistance. Thanks Yulia

4	We had some issues with our connection flights (our baggage and seats haven't been paid and selected for the further planes). Also, our seats and baggage haven't been booked for the future back flight. With all the help of the Kiwi Team (through email correspondence) and especially Mrs. Lucie K. (phone) we managed to get all things clearified and sorted out. The fees got paid back and selections and baggage bookings were made for our back flight.Good help on any kind of issue, thanks to the Kiwi Team!
1	I have recently made a booking with you for the 26/12/2016 in regards to a journey from LCY to TIA, with a connecting flight from FLR. Instead of reaching my destination, i have instead, been through a extremely traumatic experience. First of all, my flight was diverted to BLQ airport due to poor weather conditions, and i had to travel from BLQ to FLR airport in order to try and make my connecting flight to TIA. I managed to catch the flight leaving from FLR airport to TIA before it set off, as it was also delayed due to the weather conditions. When i got to FLR airport, i spoke to a lady at the check-in desk, which explained to her supervisor my situation, and the supervisor re-opened the check in desk for me as i had no hold luggage, and she was prepared to board me on that flight to TIA. After a few moments of her running some checks, she advised me that my name was not on the passenger list, and also advised me that the flight i was supposed to be catching which was: BV3268, did not exist, and was not leaving from the FLR airport at all. I called your customer service numerous times after i was told this information, urging to them my problem and that i needed to get to TIA because it was a serious family matter, a matter of life and death. After hours on the phone back and forth, waiting for call back which did not take place (there is evidence of all of this, if you want to listen to your recorded phone calls) i was told it would be impossible to get me to TIA from nor FLR or any of the surrounding airports (Milano, Pisa, or Bologna). i was then promised a flight the following morning to get me to TIA (which the agent said they BOOKED) and told to stay in a hotel for the night and i will also be compensated for this. Later that night, when i got to the hotel room, i received a call from Joseph saying that the flight that was supposedly 'booked' for me, was no longer available? how can you tell a customer you have booked them a flight then later say its unavailable? due to being messed around so much, and being stranded in a country that i do not know and never been to before, and me and my family being stressed out to a degree that is unmeasurable, to be then messed around again, and have the blamed passed around due to whos fault it is that im stranded in a different country by your employees, is absolutely sickening. Due to all of this hassle, i booked a return flight to london for the following day, as the damage had already been done, and it did not seem not 1 bit possible that anybody was going to get me out of Florence. Upon arrival home, shortly after i filled in a refund application, stating every single cost which has come out of my pocket, due to this terrible experience, which i primarily hold your company accountable for, because the bottom line is you gave me a connecting flight to TIA, which did not even exist. After stating every expense on the form, and contacting both a supervisor (who lied to me about the manager being in, and able to talk to me (her name is barbara Kubešová)) i was then passed on to a Mr Thomas Knox, who was the manager on shift. After speaking to him and explaining my problem, he said he will call me back the following day (friday 30th december 2016) regarding a conclusion to my problem, and that he will personally take it on board. I agreed to this, even though i did not really trust the customer service teams, 'call backs', from my experience. the total sum of my expenses was on average £1250, this included the booking through <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com>, the hotel i had to stay at, the return flight, money i had to spend on food to eat as i am human, i need food to survive, and also the transportation around italy from BLQ to FLR, FLR to the hotel and etc. which was not cheap. later that day i recieved a email from Barbara regarding my refund, and it said that they can only refund me £540? not even including the original full kiwi booking! she later called me after this email, and i said to her no way on earth was i going to accept that, as at the end of the day i was just asking back for MY EXPENSES due to YOUR MESS UP, which is the least i am entitled to!! And, that is being extremely considerate in relation to all the stress and grief you have caused me and my family!!! I said i wanted to speak to thomas directly and he called me back later on. When speaking to him, he was not helpful at all, and actually very agitating. He said to me he cannot refund me all my expenses because he had to contact the airline because apparently i had boarded that flight (which did not even exist) to TIA, however i was on the phone to your customer service team while the only flight from FLR to TIA was in the sky? how does that workout? and not to mention the hotel i stayed at took a copy of my passport? so i dont understand how i could be on the phone, and then in a hotel in Florence, Italy, and on a flight to tirana at the same time? He also stated he couldnt refund my full kiwi booking because 'you took the flight LCY to FLR', i took the flight with the intention to get to my destination, TIA, not get stranded in Florence? I am contacting you directly with a last resolution which is you refund me penny for penny every expense i have had due to this, because as i said, that is the least you owe me and my family, for all the grief and stress you have caused me! you can ask your customer service team to forward you the refund application which i have enlisted every last expense i have encountered due to this, and i expect it bank transfered to me immediately. Failure to do this, will lead in me taking any, and every legal action against you, and suing you for every penny possible. Along with this, i will publicise this scandal in any and every possible newspaper i can.
4	Discount airfare site Skypicker offers travelers new ways to find cheap flights <https://t.co/FeY1b4WGhO>
5	I go to a lot of comparing websites: momondo, skypicker, worldticketenter, cheaptickets, I search them all and often Skypicker is way the cheapest one!
4	Booked flts Penang to Kuala Lumpur, Kuala Lumpur to Denpassar, Denpassar to Cairns. Flights not till January 2017.  This review is about after sales support as requested by <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>.I usually book my flights direct with airlines and am very fussy about seat selection etc.  As I wanted cheapest way into Australia from Asia, <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> offered the best deal. I decided to go through this agency. On subsequently finding this meant I could not directly select my seats or apply my loyalty number I sent several emails asking for their assistance.  I said I wished to pay a supplement in order to get seats of my choice. Their response in doing this was quick and helpful. They have applied my request at the additional supplement and so far have found them to be responsive and helpful.  I hope that after taking these flights I will be able to supply further positive reviews. So far so good with this company.  I am a very frequent traveller.
5	I want to say that I've never met such a great online live support. Usually I am working till 2 or 4 am so I get home smthng around 5 am and that was the time I bought my first ticket via <http://Skypicker.com|Skypicker.com> . As it is normal I had a lot of questions and I was quite desperate and tired. Than I saw this online chat window and I said to myself. 'Ok, I'll try it.' After 5 min in the mornin I get my answers for all my questions with very kind czech language support Michaela O.I tried it today again and again I am 'super' satisfied. Open minded to solve any problem or to find a way to solve it.As <http://Skypicker.com|Skypicker.com> say: 'Ask any time'I am looking forward to my holiday on Canarian Island with my girlfriend.Thank you.Hoang
5	It was my first time booking with Skypicker and must honestly say, I was very surprised about the excellent service. Step by step Skypicker would send me information closer to the day of travelling. I found this really comforting to know that they care about my booking. Never experienced this before ...rather the opposite. Very well done!
4	Quick and very good service from  Jan Lukasek.Although you need to fix the problems with the IDs without expiration. It is the third time I can't check in myself because the system tells me that information is missing
1	Incorrectly processed my booking as 2 seperate bookings so I would have to check in and check out at transfer airport.Cannot do this due to less than 6 months on passport. Even though they did not provide sufficient information at time of booking, refuse to acknowledge responsibility and process any sort of refund, so I now have to book new flights and these ones go to waste.Absolutely appalling service and handling of the situation.
4	Thank Skypicker to solve my problem regarding of Boarding Pass very quickly.
5	Great service! So easy and fast to contact Kiwi thought many different means - i chose The chat and Youlim Was Great and solved my issue superfast- it took not even1 minute! Thx! Happy NY PpL!
5	Very helpful, fast customer service, Klara from Skypicker was great at helping me iron out the details of my booking!
5	Hi, I had a great chat with your support team. My Problem was solved in only 5 minutes, after starting the chat. A great thank you to Daniel, very good service. Thanks
5	Thank you to Alan Whitfield for helping me with some travel concerns.  He answered all my questions within minutes & I am now using this site to book my travel.  Excellent job my friend!!
5	I m honest if i say that Simon was really helpfull and he tried to understand the situation from the begining. I m really thank you to him.
5	Well, first of all, <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> is amazing. Can only recommend! Amazing, affordable and easy to understand, costumer support is incredible. Getting around the world has never been as easy! When I called to add more baggage Miss Teona did everything possible not only to get me the cheapest option, but also went through the effort of calling all the airports to make sure I don't have to pay ridiculous fees for over packing. Didn't even take an hour and she called back with results better than I could've imagined. You, miss, are a champ! Very friendly and professional. Thank you for making my next adventure possible!
5	Needed to change multiple passport details in a booking with two flight companies. Kiwi support(Lucie K.) answered quickly and was able to change the details within a couple of hours, free of charge.
5	Great customer service from these guys at Sky picker :) been a great help to me and done everything for me thanks again ! Would highly recommend them.
1	I booked one way ticket from Brisbane  to Melbourne by <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>, but I knew I made a mistake of choosing the wrong departure city and asked for cancellation immediately. It was before the ticket is issued, but Kiwi told me that it was not possible to make any refund for an already purchased ticket. So I asked for flight change, but instead of changing my flight, they suggested me a different flight which was Cheaper than my original flight; yet still told me that I had to pay extra charges for the fare. I do not understand why I was not able to make the change on the spot when no transaction or any action has taken. I also do not understand why I have to pay for the fare difference when the ticket is cheaper than original price. How would you calculate the extra charge of the ticket when there is no extra charge? <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> is not the lowest price site at all nor do they protect their customers. It was easily the worst experience ever and I will never use <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>.
5	Eva did amazing job and helped me so much fixing the flight information. She was super helpful, fast and supportive. one of the best customer service experience so far! I am really grateful!
5	I had a couple of questions about my flight tickets. I was assisted in lice chat by an agent named Bek. He was very helpful and quick to respond. I got answers to my every question.
5	I was so scared that I had to do my check in at the airport for a Ryan air voyage, but then I saw the chat, and asked that sweet girl Alexandra L, if I remember well, to check me in, and she did, whit out any costs.Good Job
3	@NevEndingVoyage What are your thoughts on discount flight finders like Skypicker? <https://t.co/KE0smolWul>
1	I'm not good at English but I really upset so I try to write the review.I booked the airplane ticket by using Skypicker.But i have other plan suddenly so i wanted to get a refund.The Peach Air that i booked is possible to refund before an hour from departure but Skypicker said i can not get a refund!I can understand certain portion of cancellation fee but not refundable is difficult to accept.And Skypicker said if I want to change the dates and destination, so I asked about changing the destinaion.But they said I can not change the destination!! AGAIN!I can't understand why i can not. They said before I can change!!Moreover I don't have time till the date of departure, but I had to wait their replay about one day!Anyone don't know what would happen!I CAN NOT UNDERSTAD WHY THEY DO NOT TRY TO UNDERSTAND CUSTOMER!!!They don't have any damage because of refund.I don't want to use Skypicker anymore..Due to Skypicker I wasted my money and time..This is my the worst experience.If you want to have comfortable travel, do not use Skypicker .絶対Skypicker利用するな後悔するはず!今とても悔しくて腹が立つ...
1	Worst customer experience I've had in my life. I am working in Dublin, away from home, and for my masters graduation my mother wanted to buy me flights to go to Prague with them for the ceremony. I paid with her card, and initially everything was fine. Then I was sent an email asking to contact the customer service in less than 12 hours to verify the card details or my booking would be cancelled. I did not have access to my email, so they cancelled my booking. When I realized this I tried calling them, as they requested. I waited on one side of the line for 20 minutes, and finally asked for a call back. The call back never happened. I chat them on their website and have to wait 15 minutes for a response back- which is not bad, to be fair, its the phone that exasperates me. They tell me that I need to book again and my funds will be back into my account in 10 days!!!!I book again with another credit card and same problem. This time I contact them as soon as they ask me to do so. Another 20 mins on the other end of the line, no customer service in Spainish, only in English, and they tell me everything is correct, and that the order should go through. This morning at 7AM the order was cancelled again. In a market as competitive as the online search engine industry, where customer experience is paramount, players that cannot satisfy the needs of their clients are doomed to fade. In my case, they lost a customer, and, if someone asks me, I will never recommend kiwi
5	Customers service on-line help desk is really kind and very helpful.Special thanks to Valery G. from Chat Service for quick help with additional insurance for my next trip. That was quick and so easy to buy this. So I can only recommend Skypicker for any travellers.
5	@MelissaPatruno didn't book my flight with Skypicker in the end cause I found a better offer. Heard by some users it's legit, though. (:
5	Had a small problem with my ticket which could have cost me but was resolved by Vladimir Fedorenko...Thanks!
5	Thank you\ Mariya Potello of <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>.  You were a God send and helped us resolve our problem!  So grateful and will use again.
5	MIchal and Anastassia were so helpful to me. Fast and professional communication. Even in problem with low cost airline, same attitude for all. Feel free to contact kiwi support with anything. Full recommendations.
5	In case anyone is needing to book flights for a fun adventure, or moving abroad, I would easily suggest using Kiwi. I have had such amazing help in customer service from them (I'm talking about you, Monika!) and they've made our moving process so much easier! They'll get you great discounted prices, and easy access to your booking at all times. I don't want to be all preachy, but Monika was the biggest blessing during all of this travel stress, and I hope she is given a great reward for her service from Kiwi. (Three cheers for awesome customer service representatives!)
5	I didnt give 6 stars, because its not possible, otherwise i would! The best service i have ever had... tap has a lot to learn with these guys! And i would definetely buy again with kiwi because of the top service i got. Sofia, tomas and katerine are a few i can remember the name... the browser need more work (closes on it self/ only complain) but the people behind it compensate it. Thank you kiwi team!
5	The company incorrectly said I couldn't check in online.
1	I just contacted Skypicker about (what they thought was) an issue with my online check in. Without answering my question at first, the customer service agent tells me that the airline cancelled my connecting return flight from Belgrade to Athens. When would I have known had I not contacted them myself about an unrelated issue? Did it literally *just* happen? Only one week before the trip, what options do I have?Would I like for them to look for alternatives or would I like a refund? Well how could I know if I have not seen the alternatives? Also, what do you do when a connecting flight is cancelled and there are no good alternatives? It is possible that I will have to cancel the whole trip if there is no good alternative, and the refund is only for the returning flight. If it's the airline's fault or Skypicker's I don't care, I have saved for months for this trip and managed my work leave very tightlyAnother concern that I have is that their website says that they check you in if an online check-in is available. Well, all 3 airlines that I booked (Ryanair, Norwegian and Air Serbia) have that service, but they could only check me in for the Ryanair flight. For the other ones, especially the connecting ones, you just hope there's enough time to run from one gate to the airline's desk to the other gate. There was a Skypicker guarantee for one of the connecting flights, but I don't know if I can trust them by now.Lastly, after I booked my ticket (how I regret that) I checked each ticket individually on each airline's website. Turns out I could have booked the whole trip cheaper by at least 20 euros, and I could check myself online on each airline's page with no problem and no running.So honestly, Skypicker for me is only good if you're looking at the combinations for flights. Then, one should book from another site or better yet from the airlines themselves. Cheaper, no surprise cancellation and no running for check-in.
5	I called for a problem concerning my reservation made on <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>, and the help that Eric provided me was very appreciated. I had very clear explanations on the situation (in english, and amazingly in french), and Eric was very thoughtful. The services of Kiwi are great, thank you again !
4	Discount airfare site Skypicker offers travelers new ways to find cheap flights | <https://t.co/wLMW2OT23z> #travel #deals
5	Easy to find the best flight and fast to book it. Helpful layout to search over  - city direction + prices directly on the map - you can see everything with a glance.My new favourite flight search engine.
5	We had trouble completing our booking but Kojo was patient and guided us through completing our transaction. Thanks skypicker and Kojo!
5	Thanks Skypicker for helping me out with online check in. You guys show great service with helping me out so i didnt get any fee at the airport. Been using Skypicker a few times now and always a good company that are willing to help their customers.
5	that little conversation gave me all information i needed for my questions to my flight. Thanks to Dorota. :-)
5	"Skypicker is intelligent flight booking website, i recommend it for all, especially for people looking for best choice for there trip, and thanks for there customer support, very helpful and fast responding (online chat), thanks to ""Tomáš Mužík"" for your time and help :)"
5	No problems, got to my destination without delays or issues.
4	Servizio eccellente. Risposte rapide e customer Service pronto a rispondere alle esigenze e alle richieste
5	I made a booking with <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> under the reference number 1036430 some time ago and all things were fine, afterwards I came up with very specific request because on my way back I am not able to print my boarding passes and I will not be able to reach my company email during all this travelling so I asked to send boarding passes only for my way back to email address of my hotel I will be staying for exact time when I will be leaving the hotel to let me print it right there for free. At this point I was going to give around 3 stars, because it seems that it is somehow systematically impossible for this company to do this procedure - I do not know why, for me it sounds and seems very easy but maybe this is somehow tricky and making some mess in Kiwi's internal system to send boarding tickets for way back to different email address than the one which was used for creating reservation and for exact time customers is asking for..but afterwards I EXPERIENCED THE REAL MEANING OF WORDS 'CUSTOMER SUPPORT' - one of your employees Martin Carter calmed me down, explained everything and assured me that I do not have to worry at all and that he will personally take care of all of the steps which have to be done to let me have it exactly as I wanted. He checked for me and told me that he will be on shift on that day and he will do everything I kindly asked for with no problem and that he will be more than glad to assist me and at top of that he was very pleasant, kind and calmed me down while I was stressed and maybe not that pleasant to him (sorry for that Martin, I had a very rough day). You know what? I think that this is the BEST CUSTOMER SERVICE I HAVE EVER RECEIVED IN MY LIFE. Martin Carter, you are the real diamond shining in <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> and I can honestly say that you are the reason why I will keep using your services and not hesitate to recommend Kiwi to all of my friends and colleagues. Thank you for everything!
4	Dorota was able to answer questions about my booking in great detail, and even via chat she was warm, personable, and very helpful.
4	Bek helpt me with problem with boardingpass for ny  wife.after 20 minutes it was solwed,and I could write out the B,pass
3	@skypicker think 30EUR voucher 4 flights (only valid within time we're on holiday anyway!) is acceptable compensation! #skypicker #watchdog
5	Thankyou very much!!! Best company and service!!! Helped us very much with our flights!Did the impossible!Definitely our favorite flying company!
5	I would really like to thank Katerina Entlerova ( KiWi customer support) for her patient and professional assistance. I strongly recommend  KiWi for flight services!
5	Sorry, I must say that he need 10 points doing things kindly ans it is very difficult to know who is writing and what is in the mind. Nice week end and enjoy. Reg. KooKoo Kari
5	"I first had some problems during the booking process - a few minutes after the first email (""payment received"") I received another email (""security problem"") stating that the booking couldn't proceed due to some issue found by a third party security screening system, with no further details... I contacted customer support via the chat, where a super helpful and cheerful Martin Carter was doing the best he could.Two days later I had time to re-try the booking using the tips he gave me. I don't know whether it was these tips or something else that made the difference, but everything worked fine, I was able to book the same connection for the same price (even though on <http://kayak.com|kayak.com> the price had changed - I was lucky enough to never have closed the original browser tab with the old price, thus saving the url and thus ID or token of my original booking attempt, allowing me to still book at that price - no idea why their software allows something like this, but I'm even more happy!)On top of all that this connection was only available via their website and nowhere else, even <http://airasia.com|airasia.com> themselves didn't show this combination of flights.I'm sure I'll book again with <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com>."
5	I had a time change for one of my flights and Barbara and the Kiwi team did everything they could to help me, treating my issue like their own - I would not hesitate to recommend Kiwi to anyone - they are incredible at customer service!
5	Great support !!! Miroslav, thank you very much for your help, you saved me so much precious time (....and maybe even some money).
5	I was provided excellent online service to manage my online check-in. Cheers Juan Costa!However, I find it rather peculiar that on my account on the website of skypicker, it said i should have checked in latest 48 hours before departure, however when contacting online support i was nicely told to relax as they would help me check in and send me my boarding cards - as it is a service provided for their customers.Hence I believe there are people who might think they are out too late and as a result have to pay a fee for checking in at the airport. Not so well structured so to say.
5	I'm happy with the service and quality .I will continue to refer to the company.
5	I had to change some flights around that'd I'd booked months out. I didn't care too much about whether I'd get a refund, I just knew I needed the flights cancelled. Martina, the wonderful representative I spoke with, was supportive through the entire process- She led me through every step and told me that, though those airlines don't offer refunds, she would try her best to at least get me a refund of the taxes I paid on those flights. She was kind and understanding, and extremely, extremely helpful- i've dealt with so many customer service reps in the past who were either rude or tried to dissuade me from making my decision, yet Martina was nothing but respectful and helpful throughout the whole process. What could have been a total headache was finished in five minutes. I love Kiwi and I love Martina! Thank you again!
5	I am about to travel and could not download my boarding pass for the second part of my flight because I had missed the deadline to update my passport details,  Radim provided me with great assistence and updated details and I was good to go.I work in Social Media for a huge travel company and can rate his service as brillaint.Thanks Radim and Kiwi ;)))
5	Very easy to book, informations are transmitted by email, everything is clear, precise and well explained. The boarding card are sent as soon as possible by email too. No need to print, just present the QR code when bording. And when there is a change with a flight, you're immediatly informed. Aleksandra Mrzyglod was very effective : she called me to explain the problem and solved it. Next time I will certainly use Skypicker to book my flight !
5	I booked a multi destination trip on <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> by midnight. Straight after I called the customer service and James answered in less than 2 minutes. James have been really helpful, he knew what kind of info he had to look for and he answered perfectly to my complex issue.Then, he helped me out to switch to another flight and called me back in no time after having contacted the appropriate airline company. He came back to me with relevant information, a great solution and clear guideline to follow the process!Thanks a million James, I am really happy I had to book with <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com>. It is from far the best customer service experience I had with flights issues!
5	I want to give a huge shoutout to the staff at <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com>, especially Eric for helping me rebook my flight. My flight was delayed causing me to miss my connecting flight to Ktm from Delhi, after being discouraged by the airline staff at the airport the kiwi team worked tirelessly finding me a great flight. Thank you for all your hard work guys, it is truly appreciated!
5	I had a great experience talking with Mr. Roman Slobodyan he helped me instantly, so my greatest recomandations.....
4	I've been using the chat support and talked to many agents. All of them helped me with my queries, especially Renata who had a lot of questions coming from my side. THANK YOU & Great job! :)
5	Support agent Maria was very polite, prompt and helpful in assisting me with a ticket transfer issue. Thank you.
1	Im moving from SJU to Dallas, and i made a reservation via skypicker with my 3 year old son.  The ticket has 1 connection to FLL, and they made 2 different reservations, meaning, that i had to get out of the plane in FLL, get my 4 bags with my baby, and my 2 extra bags, do the line for check in AGAIN, pay for the 4 bags AGAIN, to thru security check AGAIN and get in the plane for my final destination in 2 hours.  I called the UK number ( they dont have an advertised 1-800) and they tell me that i have plenty of time, and its not their fault that the airline was going to charge me for my 4 bags again, and its my fault that i chose a flight with a connection.  I travel a lot, and i do a lot of connections and this has never happened to me...but on the phone they're saying that there is no other way of doing reservations with connections, and if  I dont like it there are no refunds.  Im just calling my  credit card to cancel it and my new job will have to wait for me one more week since there are no flights for less than 700 this week. I will never buy in skypicker again.
1	Some flight arrangements by Skypickers makes passengers to go thru connecting flights and they have to collect their luggages and re check in again in the first stop. This can cause hassle, confusion, dis-appointment etc  because the passenger may not realize that they will need visas to collect their luggages in that country that they will connect flights to. It happened to my family at NAIA Philippines where they were asked by Cebu Pacific airline to pay extra transit fees for their luggages as they do not have a visa to get their luggages when they stop at Dubai. Please be aware with Skypicker and other Travel agents and make sure to clear with them about this. I had no problem with Tripsa and other travel agents before. I had this first bad experience with Skypicker!
5	I was very surprise for the excellent service provided by Skypicker  and the prices I got, was the chipper I ever found in the internet ,I don't hesitated to recommend Skypicker to my friends and family.Keep the good workJose
5	It`s very convenient and easy to access and has quality service and fast response to their customer. I appreciate the person who entertain me that is Mr. Tomas Jurik....

5	The live chat service on Skypicker is great to use. The agent Babak was very helpful answering all questions what I had!
5	the best balance between price and quality
5	I was 12 days waiting for help on a flight, and i cvalled support where Mr. Jaime was really helping in 1 hour. Was amazing, Five stars on it!
5	amazing service, i recommend every traveller and nice job Emre T... Thanks Emre T
4	I had to change my flight, since both of my flights to and from Florida were cancelled. I preferred to use the chat, since I was abroad. Every time I got connected within a minute and everyone was very helpful. I got connected to Patrik several times and he was very friendly and spoke good English. He helped me with a lot of information. I found an alternative flight myself and they booked it for me. They made a few mistakes though, and because of that it took quite a while before my flight was actually booked. Anyway, in the end <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> was the one who helped me out.The last two days were very stressful, due to the fact that I had to make a lot of calls (to my original flight companies) send a lot of e-mails, and it costed me extra money on phone calls and a new visa. I hope <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> might have a refund for these costs. Anyway, they have cheap, good flights and are very helpful!
5	I filled in the wrong details for my flight and the chat function was really helpfull. Thanks Lucie Polívková for the the good service.
5	Dear Fellow Travelers,At eOasia, we are always looking for good tips for travel lovers.Have you ever tried... <https://t.co/5uS0ix10Fs>
5	Olga took care of my request accurately and quickly
5	got quick and good answers from Martin Carter!
5	I managed to enter wrong date when booking my flight and it was 1 month late, unfortuantley i couldn't wait 1 month as i had to travel tommorow so i contacted live support after 5 minutes i meet Stan. Stan a great person who tried to help me and sort it out after 10 minutes he managed to sort it out for even though i'm gonna receive a fee for this its fine as i'm happy to came cross such great service person as stan
5	GREAT SERVICE AND FAST REPLY. I HAVE BEEN TALKING TO PAVEL FOR AN ADDITIONAL LUGGAGE ON A FLIGHT. VERY FRIENDLY AND HELPFUL. USING  SKYPICKER FOR THE FIRST TIME, BUT CERTAINLY I WILL DO AGAIN.
5	I would like to thank Natalia in particular from the live chat as she re-checked baggage size for me and made sure I got it updated accordingly on the e tickets. She was really helpful and understood my queries perfectly.
5	excellent service on the live chat, Jonathan was so polite and helpful and really saved this trip for us, thank you so much Jonathan, i will definitely use skypicker again in the future
5	Hello! So yesterday I noticed that I forgot to make check in to my father in law and my nice. And that was a fee comming for them because of my mistake. So I called kiwi. Eric answer the phone! Was just amazing! He was patient because my newborn baby was just crying a lot, and he still could be with me on the line plus giving me tips to calm her down! And help me with a check in so quickly and so professionally! Thank you for that! And for having so kind and nice people on the other side of the line!
1	It was a big mistake to use kiwi. Booking was made. Money taken and then booking was cancelled and no alternative flight was given even though they still had flights advertised. The money has still been kept and I'm sure I will have to continue with criminal action tomorrow and report this company to the police. They are clearly taking money for flights they do not have available and instead of pre authorizing g the payment they take the full amount and tell you the reason they can't give you the money back yet is because of the bank. Everything g that goes wrong with kiwi is always somebody else's fault. Be very careful with this company. Like me you will get stuck at your destination because of their mistake and you won't have access to you money to book with someone else. TAgain. If you use this company there will only be problems and you will not get the immediate return of your money. My advice is go direct to the airlines.If you read this please warn your friends
5	I just had the greatest experience live chat with Olesia.She  helped me on every step to figure out how to check-in and receive my boarding passes for an upcoming trip.Thank you!
5	Our flight was delayed 4 hours in Asia, therefor we missed another connecting flight where we had to purchase another ticket with our own money. When we got back to our final destination we contacted <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> and explained the situation to them. Thanks to Mohammed and his team they reviewed our situation without any issues and were more than happy to help. They got back in contact with me in quick time and were pleased to notify me that we would be getting reimbursed the full amount of money that we paid to book new flights. Many thanks and would definitely recommend.
1	Please don't use Skypicker they have bad customer service and they are useless. This is the last time I will book a flight with them.
1	Ask for Romana Buaiscia - she saved my flight!After dealing with three incompetent agents on the online chat Romana had the patience to finalize all my requests - and she made sure that any extra costs that would be added due to the three previous agents' mistakes were covered by Skypicker.Way to go - good service (Romana - not the rest)!
5	Me and my girlfriend got stuck in bad weather on our holiday and wanted to reschedule some flights we had booked. Your customer service agent LENKA helped us out in the best of ways and we got all questions answered and new tickets booked. Super satisfied!Also, really good feature that I always get the question of having the chat transcript emailed to me.
4	3 hrs before my flight I realised I still had not received my boarding pass. Stressing I quickly called customer service and Igor helped me out fast and sent me through my boarding passes for both flights within 10 mins! Thank you so much!! Lifesaver!
5	Really appreciate the quick and correct service via E-mail. Usally you have to wait several days for an answer but Alice, Irina, and Fahd at the support replayed within minutes, great service!
5	Michaela helped me on the chat and it was perfect
5	Search for my flight schedule, found the great price, go to airport, fly and arrive. Everything is just perfect. Hassle free and no worries!
5	I am yet to complete my actual flight, but I have already had a query with my booking that I wanted to iron out before my flight. So far the Sky Picker team have been extremely helpful. A special thanks to Valery (I believe her full name is Valery B... I have already quit the chat). I look forward to my flight!
5	I wanted to change my ticket as I want to prolong my stay. Henceforth I made contact via the chat function and Eszer B. was the consultant on the other end.Although there was an apparent problem with the connection to the airline provider, Eszer was able to confirm the price for the change  after almost 1,5 hours and also advised on a better deal.Overall a very good experience! Well done Eszer!Best,Michaela
5	Kiwi could have requested a fee for correcting my spelling error in one of our middle names. Instead they just corrected it an freed us from any issues with discrepancies btw tickets and passports. Special thanks to Archie and Erik :)
5	Kristina helped me a lot with my check-in, great support!
5	She was very helpful, extremely polite, accommodating and patient.
5	I missed the check in date because i was on holidays without phone and internet, so it would have cost me a lott to do the check in at the airportVlad answered the online chat and he was a great helphe resolved the situation and did ny check in!!Thank you so much!
3	So far the customer service in chat is pretty good by Ondra. Lets see the next.
5	Everything worked great, even when one flight was cancelled they immediately found another one and called me immediately to let me know

4	I used Skypicker for the first time and found a great flight which I booked. I  wanted to add a bag to check in, hold luggage and was surprised that this was priced with an extra surcharge - i thought i had selected it but it didnt come through on my receipt. I called customer service immediately to see what went wrong, who sent me a link so I could add the bag. I was shocked by the extortionate pricing for adding hold luggage after having completed the booking, which was almost 4 times as much as in the original booking fee, pre completion. I complained and asked for help, which I received. They were able to add my bag for the price that was originally stated on the online booking. Thanks a lot for your support. Staff was always very friendly and helpful. Eva
5	I had an issue with the online check in so I used the online chat and I spoke with ALAN, he has been very very helpful and patient with me. Great customer service!!!
5	Firstly Kiwi offered the best prices I could find! When my flight from Reykjavik to Boston got delayed they offered me an alternative flight to cover if I missed my connection at no extra cost. When I missed the connection due to the delay I spoke to Patrik about getting an alternative flight and he went above and beyond (they also offered hotel coverage) I spoke to Patrik again later to check that the booking was going through and he was once again really helpful. Great price and great coverage and service if something does come up
5	Had a problem which was solved by a great support team via the Chat function. Thx Luis S for your help!!!!!! Now I can put my mind at ease.
2	I purchased tickets through <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> because on Kayak they were advertised as being 15% discounted than booking directly through Pegasus Airlines. I took this claim at face value and purchased the tickets. That same day, I checked the prices through Pegasus and learned that I would have saved 20% booking through them directly. So much for the supposedly discounted ticket prices.I imagine you can sometimes find cheaper deals through Kiwi, but do your research first. I was disappointed by my experience and their customer service left much to be desired--I requested a call back through their online chat and several days later still haven't heard back.
1	If I could give them zero stars I would. Don't EVER use Skypicker to book your flights!! They will not tell you about added or extra fees you will have to pay for once you're at the airport!! And when you attempt to contact customer service, they'll blame you and NOT work with you at all. Book directly through the airlines instead of a third party.
5	Natalya was very kindly and was very helpful for me.Thanks a lot.
5	It was very helpful and solved all the problems that occured. Thank you! :)
5	Thanks to Bogdan, I got my boarding cards quickly sent to my e-mail. excellent service.
4	many options to pick up the flights by duration, price, stop overs etc.
5	I can say that this company and support department is on a really high level. I didn´t have to wait long time for the answer, they were really kind and helpful. What do I appreciate a lot is the fact, I could send an e-mal in my mother tongue and explain the situation better. Big thanks to Johana, Adam, Jiří and Peter.
5	Tomas was very helpful during the live chat and answered all my questions to the point. Would thumb up for a raise !
1	DO NOT USE.  Worst company ever. I needed to change my flight due to my connecting flight being cancelled. After being given the absolute runaround on the phone I was told they would get back to me with in a few hours. Nothing. Called again. Same thing. Then I called again and was told now I could not change or refund as it was less than 24 hours before the flight was due ! Worst customer service dirty trick ever and I had to forfeit the fare and buy another one with a different airline. VERY UNHAPPY
4	Lukas was very helpful in getting our issue cleared up about the added baggage.  Was able to correct it rather quickly and informed me of some things I'd need to know for checkin and airport protocol.  Thanks Lukas!-Megan, CO
5	Although we bought bucket price fares in Vietnam the airline was a quality airline and the flights were all on schedule and went smoothly.I recommend allowing a minimum of ninety minutes before flight departure in Ho Chi Minh City for check-in.
5	The staff was very helpful, they help me with reservation problem immediately, without any issue.
4	RT @skypickercom: Kick off the New Year with this €10 gift from us! <https://t.co/UT7h9MtgMw>
5	Great customer service. Had live chat with Babak and he helped me immediately
5	Quick and beneficial help from filip, thank you :)
5	I recommend the customer service because of their quick reply and professional deal,I really recommend them . . .
5	After a mistake of mine in my reservation I got a wonderful support by Roman Slobodyan that managed to arrange a perfect solution with a minimum loss. I really have to say thank you
2	Initial booking did not give the legal time of 1 and half hours between  local and international flight so the flight was missed as the local flight was delayed a short while causing us to miss the checking time.The agents when called were not helpful at all and only the next day did we get hold of Julia on live chat. She was fantastic and organised an alternate flight. This now cost and extra $150 to change the flight because <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> messed up in the first place and an extra 24hrs to the trip.
4	Thank you for the help I got on checking in online by Martin and Pavel.
5	Igor helped me out quick and easy to change my booking details. 5/5, easy.
4	Talked to James from skypicker. Got to talk to someone quickly. very polite and helpful.
3	Site Information Updated: #<http://skypicker.com|skypicker.com> - <https://t.co/OOOAPezynM>
5	Few days ago I made a flight booking via SkyPicker. That was a positive expirience and here is why:1) The web tools for searching for a cheap flights with flexible dates and flexible direction are outstanding :)2) There is no extra comission fee for using service. I checked out the flight price on the web-site of air-company wich originally issued tickets. The rice was the same as I paid on SkyPicker.3) I made a mistake while fulfilling application form, and realised that only after final payment. I asked for help, and Mohamed, who was on client support that time, solved my issue in the realtime in a short term.Thank you,and keep improving your platform !
5	I am so very happy and relieved that my questions were answered and my problem solved, I was on live chat with Martin Chudy, he was wonderful and knowledgeable.
5	Elsa helped me understand my booking issue and solved everything in a most expert manner; so far so good, thums up, high five for <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>
1	I had a flight scheduled at 11 o'clock last night, I ask the flight cancellation at nine in the morning , not say Articles Giving an answer within 24 hours , and one never thought possible in Korea , I think in the absence of time affect airline computerized , I thought I 'd be able to cancel immediately , so when you drag the time whether fees are going to stick , am so disappointed , I would like not doing chatting using the internet in Korea kiwi com ,give full refund and cancle reservationsI,m seung yeol Oh reservation number 1098658Reveal answer in 20 minutes
5	Booking was very simple.Prices are great. And sales support team is very helpful. I was talking few minutes ago with Petra M. She was wery nice person. She describes me any details of my trip, she explained me everything in great, friendly atmosphere. So I'm recommanding everybody to book with <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com>, and greetings for Perta M. from Poland.
5	We booked a 3 flight leg on our upcoming India/Thailand trip through Kiwi, and the first airline rescheduled and re-routed our flight. The new flight left 4 hours earlier and we weren't going to be able to make it to the airport in time. A few emails/chats with Kiwi and they re-booked us on entirely different flights that got us to our same destination with very similar times as what we had originally booked. The best part was that because the rescheduling was out of our control, they didn't charge us any change fees!I would definitely use Kiwi again, knowing they stood behind their flight cancelation/rescheduling guarantee. We would have had to make a lot of changes and pay extra money if we had booked directly with the airlines.Thanks Kiwi!
5	Sena was a great help for me. I was able to get my flight details in an instant and she made changes from the wrong information I have provided. Over all experience was great and I am satisified.
5	I would like to appreciate Abigail Aurisla Mensch-Travel Consultant, for taking care of our itinerary and doing needful corrections as requested! Exemplary service! Way to go!! :)
5	I just had a great Experience with Skypicker, the agent PUPUT helped me change a flight free of charge right after I bought the wrong ticket without notice it, she was really helpful and polite. Keep working like that, I highly recommend PUTPUT as an agent and Skypicker as an efficient travel agency.
5	Eric was great and helped me retrieve my boarding passes very quickly. The service was efficient and the employees are very friendly.
5	Great service after Frontier Airline canceled my flight, it's rare to have professional like that these days.
5	<http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> is amazing!  We had to cancel a flight booking very last-minute (on a non-refundable flight) and they got us back as much money as they could from the airline. Given that the reasons for our cancellation were incredibly traumatic and upsetting, we were so glad that they treated us with so much kindness and concern.Shout out to Lukas and the other agents involved for going the extra mile.  We will definitely be choosing <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> again!Thanks so much guys! Your help really meant a lot to us!
5	Just had a talk with Skypicker assistant Irina. I was need information about the possibilities of exchange the existing booking on the earlier one. She gave me all information that I was looking for and now I have all the answers for my questions. It is very professional and qualified assistance. Thank you very much :)
5	My reservation includes three different flights, but I realized that I need to skip my first flight.I wasn't sure if I can just show up to second flight without having it cancelled after not showing up on the first one.Anastasiia K. confirmed quickly that I can start my journey from second flight and skipping first flight will not affect my reservations with other airlines.It was explained fast and efficiently, thank you!
4	Two negatives only: the lack of visibility on why one of the boarding cards couldn't be issued online and the fact that there was no option throughout the booking process to input company details for invoicing purposes.The latter was swiftly sorted by Puput Cibro upon contacting customer service.
2	Not sure just yet..Arrived at Sydney Airport for departure to singapore, checked the screen regulary for hours and saw nothing.Eventually found out the flight had been changed weeks ago but i didnt know.Round 2 today as the flight had been moved forward a day so see what happens as yesterday caused me miss connecting flight to thailand. Skypicker emailed me 13 hours ago to say there was another connecting flight, i said yes but havent heard anymore, due to fly out in a few hours but still dont know. Dont see a contact phone number, wish they would contact mePaul Mingers
1	Terrible customer service. Needed to change a flight and after two weeks of emails and phone calls I was told the change fee was increased from $45 euros to $100 because of the time that had passed. Well it would have been changed two weeks ago if you processed my change when I requested it. Starting to think this might be a normal way for them to increase fee revenue!!!
5	Good flight company. Easy to book and everything works. Nothing to complain!
5	I had sum concerns regarding the change at airport, but after emailing service assistant Ondre, he responded quickly and helped with the required info i needed and set my mind at ease. cheers chris
5	I used <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> for the first time.Due to a misunderstanding the names in the booking got mixed up.I've contacted the Kiwi team via chat, and I was assisted by Jakub and Bertlomiej. They promised me to contact the airline involved and contact me with the outcome. I was more than happily suprised to have a solution FOC within 2 hours, and to be contacted in a professional, polite but friendly way.Working in the travel industry myself I know what effort those guys did .So I'm happy and thankful !I will surely recommend <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com>thanks!Frank
5	Thanks For good service with help to manage our booking
5	I've tried skypicker for the first time for a connecting flight in Asia. The service is very well informed and everything worked smoothly!
5	All other sites I've come across ask where you want to go and then find prices. As far as I'm aware Kiwi are unique in that they simply ask how far in the world you want to go then show the cheapest fights within that distance. As someone who just wants to get out there and see places this is fantastic. I was a bit wary about having the booking process taken out of my hands completely but there were no problems and Kiwi sent boarding cards and other information without any prompting at all.
5	Irina was very helpful and answered all my questions. Thanks!
4	i called with qustions and requirments after the booking, i asked for a vegiterian meal, sit next to window, qustions about what ticket shuld i print and how it works, everything was explained with a god welling and with  proffisionality!thenk you for the help mohamed, the stress i had about the flight befor is gone now! i am calm.
5	Excellent service with my check-in for my upcoming flight. Representative Elsa was fantastic in helping with my check-in requirements. She was excellent and very helpful.Thanks
5	I could not check in online and Oga has brilliantly solved my problem . thank you.
5	The Agent Petra was very helpful and polite, informative. thanks
5	Very great service for customers, all my flight problems solved very professional by Aleksandra Mrzyglod.
5	skypicker online chat is very helpful and I really appreciate  their big help:)))))
5	Unfortunately, I hadn't noticed that with kiwi you had to check in before the usual check-in time with kiwi itself and not with the airline- however, Roman Slobodyan responded to my request to check me in after the deadline promptly and resolved my issue. I got my tickets via e-Mail within half a day. So thank you very much again!
4	Skypicker website is Inteligent and Smart.Other booking website are just using the same search strategy as other booking websites. There's no difference among them.Skypicker is Smart and out of the box.
5	I'm giving Radim a perfect score on this one,he assisted me so well and was able to deliver the results before the given timeframe. He made sure that he will take care of everything for me to have what I was supposed to have,thumbs up for you Radim. And to <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>,continue to hire people like Radim,a great asset to your company and really looks after customers like me.
5	I'm asisst for flight my boss to Moscow. My Boss flight was cancelled and team skypicker just call me in a day my boss flight. But skypicker team responsible for this case. They booked for me new flight soon. And now, My boss still flight to  destination with the same time.Thanks again for team skypicker, especially to Mr. Jurat  Supervisor from Skypicker and Katerina!
5	Although I missed my check-in window from Kiwi (48 hours before flight) I contacted their online chat Help-Desk and Stan, a very friendly and fast acting guy managed to do the check-in for me (4 Flights) in just two minutes. I am very satisfied with Kiwi's service, and Stan's especially, and i really hope to keep Booking flight's through their Excellent site. Thank You guys a lot!!
5	I had 2 bookings and in the meantime there was a new passport issued to one member of my party. I called Customer service and talked to Anna Tomenendalova. She very graciously put in new passport information, corrected titles and contacted the airlines for all the changes. She kept me updated in all stages of changes by email. I appreciate how easy it was to go with these guys. I found them through Kayak.
5	Thank you to Adam Jelínek for help me in 2minutes after i open the chat, fast and good service :)
1	Pros: Easy to reach customer service, quick response time, cheap tickets but not necessarily the best value.Cons: 1)We booked via Kiwi on a NokAir flight for which the basic baggage allowance was 2 checked baggage - 15 kg for 2 people. Kiwi sent us a confirmation of 1 baggage allowance for 2 passengers, so we either had to pay kiwi for the 2nd bag (which was already in our allowance) or send the bags separately (which was cheaper at £76.00 via local post office) 2) You cannot access your flight details on the airline website to amend yourself (you have to contact Kiwi and there will be a heavy price to pay: 106 EUR) or to check in online (via Kiwi which is thankfully free) but they forgot to send 1 boarding pass out of 3. We tried to contact them but were not replying at this point and our travel was the next day. Thankfully, we were able to confirm that we were still able to travel by calling the airline. 3) For a 14 hour flight, the allowance was only cabin bags, so we had to purchase checked bags separately for. We paid £522.00 for our flights, and £117.80 total for bags. If the price difference between kiwi and other agents is less than £100, my advise would be to go for the alternative. Other than the above 3 issues, I would consider using Kiwi again provided the price difference is over £100.00.
4	Everything was great. Online support was helpful and fast. Only thing is there is no way to get eticket in the app (not a pdf file but a ticket in app)
5	I wanted to change my flights. and  a guy work there his name is David he was so helpful the sky is the limit. He is a true professional in what he is doing. Thank again David from Yasser Mahrougi
5	excelent customer service, at first i was having trouble with my check in but the problem was easily and quickly solved by Samuel , in the customer service chat, all in a few seconds and in a very polite and collaborative way.Great service, great people, great savings on flights.Carry on like this <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>!A great thank you again to Samuel!

I hope there is any more problems in my  travel.
5	Eva O. helped me with the changes that I had to do in my booking because I entered some wrong passports dates. She was very professional and quick and the problem would be solved in some minutes. Many thanks Eva. This is a great service! It would be great, if everybody could work like that!
5	so far so good.Thank you for help and friendly attitude, Eszter.All the best.
5	Simon was so patient with me on the phone! im so happy simon helped me out, very cool patient, kind gentleman. makes me enjoy buying my flights from kiwi
5	Just spoke to one of the customer service agents (Radim at 22.40pm) who was not only kind but also very helpful and friendly. It was Something that doesn't go unnoticed. It's nice to get A star service. Lovely company and I would definitely use them again! - Ryan
5	This company is not like other chip dirty companied that are trying to rub you, i hope they maintain their policy of giving good support to customers.
5	All I can say is that I  found Skyjacker very simple to use, clear fare and a excellent back office and customer service. I need a help for my check in online procedure ad Ira V. was very professional and polite. In just few minute we've complete the procedure and I receive my boarding pass! Nice Job!

5	I called kiwi for support and I got the best help from Mohammed who works there!
4	guiness ...!!! on the way to Dominica.. ;)
5	We had problems with a flight and missed out connecting flight. The <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> staff were awesome. They were available immediately through live chat and talked me through what would happen.They arranged alternative flights, explained how we could get to the other airport and will reimburse the expense.Thanks to <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> what was a really stressful experience was kept under control and any extra expenses were avoided.I would absolutely use <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> again and would recommend them to anyone.Marian
5	Friendly and efficient service. Petr was very helpful. Thanks!
5	We had a great journey thanks to Kiwi. The booking on the homepage was so easy and very functional. Also the prices were lower than if we would've booked directly via the airlines homepage. After we made the booking we asked if we could book more luggage one (!) day before the first flight. The worker at the telephone support was very helpful and made it possible to a reasonable price. Thanks!
4	"I received excellent customer service by ""Tomas Krivanik'' - when infromations from my booking needed changing."
5	I was helped very well by Natali. She assisted me in finding out if it, for my specific travel, was possible to only use a part of the itinerary. It was not possible, but she helped me well by taking time out to really check it.

5	I spoke to Vika, she was very helpful and responded quickly to my inquires. There needs to be more people like her, I recommend speaking to Vika for all future inquiries. Thank you very much Vika.
5	Thank you for the fast support. I haven't received e-tickets, but I have contacted by chat and your agent Miroslav helped so OPERATIVE. Thank you for your professional work, Miroslav!
1	Terrible service from Skypicker aka Kiwi - BEWARE - DO NOT TRUST!Would not trust any of their online platforms as dates indicated as you are booking are not the dates booked by them and are then non refundable. We had to book a return flight directly with the airline due to Kiwi refusing to accept that we did not book a flight down and a return flight three months apart to return to Melbourne for a funeral this weekend. Better off searching through other third parties as they cannot be trusted and will ignore all resolution requests.
4	It is helpful I can make self check-in via internet or with help on cs link, but on the other site you haven't good name over low cost flight :( I have to pay morr money to print the flighz board pass cause ryan air has new rules and you have old verison.(code vs qr).
5	Thanx for making me understand my booking situation better, by explaining it very good.
5	Thank you so much for wonderfull service from the custormer support they solved all my issues and problems very fast i would also like to thank GRAEME for helping me big time everything went smooth and easy once again thanks for everything I highly recommend <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> to anyone out there its cheap fast and reliable :)
5	Great service, thank you Agent Irina!
5	Lukas Janecka was my live chat agent. He helped me make changes to my booking. great customer service, very responsive.
1	Reservations at <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> are NOT confirmed after finishing the booking, but much later (in case of being confirmed...).I received the confirmation of the flight just in time to run to the airport and catch the plane. Only after calling to customer service 4 times, last time crying (the reason for the flight was to assist a funeral) and after asking for a manager and deny to hanging up the phone until having a solution from there side. They didn´t even offered me the possibility of giving me a refund so I had to wait hours and pay extra for a different flights, much more expensive that the price of the same plane when I first call customer service and they confirmed that my reservation wasn´t confirmed by the airline.I reported my case to customer service asking for an explanation which demostrated that my case was isolated and a compensation for the problems caused.Their response only demostrated that they didn´t even read properly my first complaint or studied my case and only when I insisted they accepted to refund only for the extra money I had to spend in other to take a different flight at the same time that the one booked at the beginning.The politeness of the Customer team worths nothing if they don´t do their job properly.
5	I was talking few hours on chat with ulug and david , best guys ever ,thank you so much for your help!!! big kiss for them ! next time for sure i'm gonna choose Skypicker !

5	Firstly I would like to thank Catalina L. and Dominika (the call center support operators) that helped me sort my problem out. I mistakenly booked a tiket with a month later than the expected travel date and I immediately saw this after my ticket was confirmed. Next thing I did was to call the support line and tell them my issue. After a bad experience with a different travel agent I didn't think I'm going to get my money back or be able to find the right ticket but I still had hopes.Catalina L. And Dominika not only that they helped me get full refund from 3 different airlines but they ware very cost efficient as they ware the one calling me back to keep me updated. They emailed me with other available options and everything went very smooth, not to mention that they have low prices compared to other travel agencies. Great manners, very understanding and professional, organized and with good time management. Great service!
5	i will prefer to use kiwi for all of my future flight booking
5	Kiwi help to find a very good deal, I believe i got the best fare rate available after going to several other web searching for the same flight.  And when I need to contact customer service, I had very good attention to resolve the question and problem that i had.  I recommend KIWI 100%.
5	Skypicker helped to find the most convenient connecting flights for the holidays, they did the online check-in for me and just sent the tickets to me. So simple!  The Support centre staff is really helpful and responds fast. Will definitely use Skypicker services for my next trips and will suggest to my friends!
1	This is quite frankly the WORST travel agent that I have ever had the displeasure of dealing with. My friend and I booked his flights to the Philippines and then realised that he needed to change his departure date and return date. We understood that there would be a fee incurred but did not in our craziest dreams begin to imagine that it would cost $1000! the original flights cost $1400 so all together he would be expected to pay $2400 for 1 person to fly economy with several layovers and a total of 24hours travel time! We then pursued to obtained a refund so we could find a more reasonably priced flight but was told that a refund was not possible, so as frustrated as we were we tried to pay the $1000 and then the site kept having an error poping up and not processing the payment. After this we called customer service and was made to believe that it was something that of our fault as to why it wasnt being processed. This is outrageous and terrible service, this is the most unproffessional rip off of a service provider that i have ever come across. With all of the hoops that we have been made to jump through it would have been easier to pay a monkey with bananas to complete our request. The lack of competence of the people working here is unfathomable! I will gladly be sharing this review and additional thoughts about this company till i die. The only reason that i gave this company a 1 star review was so that i could get this review to you! i highly recommend you start putting customers first to generate loyalty to the company as this is disgraceful! Not happy at all with this situation as it is still not resolved and my friend can not change this situation even tho it my jeaprodise his wedding plans which is the whole purpose of the trip! I hope your happy with yourselves SKYPICKER you may have ruined a wedding.
4	Despite a problem with our flight, Skypicker - in particular David - was really really helpful in getting us back on track. He was really understanding of the situation and managed to sort out our problems with the best results possible. We really appreciate it! Thank you.
5	I would like to thank agent Bek for kindness and all informations in such short time!
5	We were helped by Kristyna Mlcuchova and she was really helpful. She updated our information even if it was not possible to do it on the website, and it was a quick and professional service, thank you!
4	but i am sure you are cheating passengers. actually i have paid all amount on DEC 19 -2015 . an amount of  GBP 159 has been deducted on the time of reservation . anyway i got another message from bank on 05/01/2016 after many days of travel regarding the GBP 159 has been deducted again from my card. i can prove with any documents . already i sent email to you with my ID copy, passport copy , previews ticket copy , card number details ,card holder names and everthing .but i didint get any proper response from your side . now i am requesting to every passenger please dont enter your CREDIT card details in this websit (<http://skypicker.com|skypicker.com>) . you will lost money anytime . also you will get a joke reply : you didint make any reservation on that day .  actually they are cheating . they will save our card details in their web .kindly beware .. i am requesting to all passenger kindly cancell your ticket with skypicker and ask them for refund . also call to your bank and take a request to block your Credit card . otherwise they will use anytime  . you will lost your money without any authentication
5	"Extremely great service.FOA I am a front-end software developer - and I find a <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> website as a kind of a masterpiece. It's as useful as possible. Great UX. Thanks for all the developers and the designers. Honestly, you are the best.Secondly (and it's the main part) - support team works like a charm. I have two cases which made me the forever kiwi user. In August I've forgot to check-in online on my WizzAir flight - and support team messaged me smth. like ""Please, send us your ID details in order to check you in"" - and they did it like 3 hrs. before take off in 10 minutes, so I even was not forced to pay an additional check-in fee!This night, I've decided to make something bigger from my trip to Stockholm so team helped me to completely change my route back (departure and destination) airport and it was completely awesome.Thanks, Vojtech Oplustil, Rita Marques and David P., to make this happen, and thanks to whole <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> team for this lifetime adventures.Love it.Cheers!"
4	I recently found <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> when searching for a cheaper way to get to Sydney Australia from Prague in high season. Kiwi offered an interesting option with 4 flights Prague-Istanbul-Kuwait-Manila-Sydney via budget airlines Pegasus and CebuPacific.First 3 flights were 1-2 hours late, but this did not matter as still arrived in time for last flight which arrived in Sydney on time (though we could not disembark for 30 minutes due to need to re-enter parking bay!!). Kiwi were efficient in dealing with queries. Budget airlines give no food or drink for free, so I took my own. I had worried about the 7-8 kilo weight limit for cabin bags, but if you check in on line and bag looks ok, you are not weighed. For the saving of several hundred dollars, the extra 10 hours waiting time at airports en route was worth it to me, but would not suit all. I even learnt to do sudoku while waiting courtesy of one of the in-flght magazines!
4	I had an easy time with the automatic check-in and my flights were the lowest price available.I will use this service again.
5	I am really impressed at the high level of customer service and attention the representatives at KIWI give their customers. I forgot to add a meal package (2x) and incorrectly added passenger names on my tickets. Saskia K, Anastasia F and Aliz from KIWI helped me fix my errors and followed up with emails confirming all requests have been made. Its hard to find this type of service today.  I am now a loyal customer of KIWI and will recommend to all my family/friends.
2	I've just had a rather unpleasant experience with Kiwi travel.  I booked a simple online flight from Siem Reap, Cambodia to Bangkok as I had to catch an early morning flight the next day, outbound to New York for work.  I figured it was a simple procedure and I'm in the travel/tourism business so wasn't concerned.  When I arrived at the airport, they mentioned that the flight had been booked for the morning, not the evening, by the agent.  Subsequently, I missed all outbound flights to America which cost my company and myself.  HOWEVER, in spite of all of this chaos and incompetence, I did come across a truly amazing guest service representative on the live chat feed by the name of LENKA...she was incredibly helpful, asking very intelligent questions, and digging for answers on my behalf.  I vowed to never book with Kiwi again but because of LENKA, I'm reconsidering...but only if I can deal directly with her! :)  She deserves recognition and appreciation...women like her make up for all of the ineptitudes, carelessness, and lack of guest service...Thank you, LENKA, you saved the day for me (and possibly for Kiwi!)
5	grazie Irina, gentile e disponibile. mi ha aiutato a risolvere il problema in qualche minuto
1	Websites doesn't work again! We have to change our flights and everything is a big problem! Do you want an advice? Problem! Support on phone is not able to help you, because they know nothing! I do NOT recommend!
5	I have to say i book on line frequently and i have found that Kiwi takes all the stress out of finding flights and adding the little extras easily.The online chat service from Thomas U was excellent i will defiantly be using this site againWayne Ferris
5	I applied for Booking agent position but was told there is no position available to offer me, can i apply again??
5	Booked with kiwi Must of booked my flight at 4 in the morning,  as i wrote my name wrong on the booking and didn't notice till last minuet. :( hahahaKatka from here fixed me up right away, connected the airline and sorted out my problem.very professional and prompt.one happy customer many thanks :) steve
5	Customer service is great and the company is prompt in arranging alternatives to make your journey smooth and comfortable
5	very very good service, thanks jonathon done a grate job
1	Kindly do not user their service. They cheated so badly and didn't compensate at all.
5	excellent.....recommend
5	Skypicker is able to find best combination of flights within few minutes. Using ordinary programs it would take hours to find out the same combination. It is very usefull if you don´t mind where exactly to fly. For me this is the best website for searching flights!
5	Love the suport chat function and Tomas is a F****** Star!
4	I was looking for low cost options to travel from Malaysia to Australia and was impressed at the way the options were clearly laid out to show value, airlines & travel time. Found the website easy to use and would go to again for future bookings.
5	I appreciated <http://SkyPicker.com|SkyPicker.com> for offering great instruments for searching the right flight for the best price, clearly and easily, including different interesting possibilities of arraning the trip.After purchasing, everything was easily done via internet. No problems. I already recommended SkyPicker to my friends and I will continue on doing this.
3	@skypickercom hi thanks for trying and very strange- the phone is with me and I have not called anyone for past one hour- 00975-17761359
5	I called regarding something that wasn't clear to me. Joshna was my customer service agent. Excellent english skills, promptly resolved the issue and understood what my concerns were. I received the email straight away as to what we talked about.
4	Great service but please let me choose the seats next time.
5	I accidentally missed the 72 hour window to check in for my flight and was worried I would have to pay a lot of money at the airport. I was able to talk with Lukas over messenger and he was able to fill in my passport details for me so that I could check in without a fee. He was extremely helpful and was very fast in responding to me and in fixing my problem.
5	It's always refreshing to see there is a real person behind the screen. I had several questions, which Vlad gladly answered. Not only that, he took the initiative and answered other related questions, rather than waiting for me to ask. And he offered me advice. It made my experience with kiwi that much better. Thank you, Vlad!
5	very2 nice service.. I love it... I will see u soon
1	"Easy to book with however there is a lot of confusion over the check in process. Then I have spent over an hour trying to talk to someone via the ""24/7 helpline"" - including both the phoneline (which was on hold for 30mins before cutting out) and the live chat, which similarly ended by itself with no help offered. Automated text and emailsreceived this morning (72hrs before flight) demanding that Passport details be uploaded onto our booking. Yet, there is NOWHERE on our Manage Booking to upload these details. Again we get the block concrete answer of ""call our 24/7 helpline"", which does not answer our calls. Help!"
4	I bought good price ticket for my flight to Scotland! I was first nervous because  it was the first time I have done this, bought tickets online!Should it work, was it for real?Was it a fake? And did the boarding pass come in time?Should I  get through ?If I Got stuck  in London  airport at the first stop?I was worried! !But it all worked out fine, and I got to Scotland  and back home as well!I had no trubbel with anything, but ..I wish the boarding pass would come earlier than the same day you travel.And yes!! I would travel with kiwi again, by ticket through them.Thanks!!Cecilia
1	From Chiangmai to Bali I find out at the airport that Skypicker has made two separate booking so I have to go through customs and everything in Malaysia to get my bags and also to get back on the plane.Won't be using again
5	Great job from Filip to help me out with changing my reservation details!
5	Excelent service !I was struggling about  all my luggage. I received support from Ondrej  who solved all my questions.He helped me to fix my reservation quickly and very nicely.Thanks for your excellent service. Yanan Chu
5	great and fast service, talked to agents Stan and Eleanora who are both nice and so accomodating... keep it up!
5	Just nice services. Used in Paris.What is a bit annoying later - constant  emails with different offers, not too often but not needed.
5	Awesome and Fast response from their team! Good job Skypicker! Thank you!!!!!! From Singapore:)
5	Thank you for your help with refund Jan, very fast and good.
5	Have experienced good, quick and reliable service from <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com>.
5	very nice services.i talked with a man named Vlad and he was very kidness and very good with me.He helped me a lot with all.thank you vlad
4	Prefering e-mail for changings on the booking process
5	My passport number was changed in one day 72h before my flight, knowing that I have 2 different companies under which I am registered. Nice! Thank you guys
5	This is no jokes, but the customer services were intelligent, polite and accurate in analysing the issue and were able to help me in record time. Truly a travel company which excellent customer focus. I hope other companies especially the ones in UK can learn some things from SkyPicker.My issue was complex and was to be done in a very short time. Everyone helped me and especially a gentleman names Miquel, i really thank him as he's the man who is the man.
5	Lenka and Lucie helped me very much, thank you !! I had an issue with online check in and they helped me though the online chat. That was awesome.
5	Really the best low-budget flight booking service I have ever used. SOOOO helpful and customer service is really fantastic. Will be booking with Sky picker again!
5	It´s being a great service so far and Lucie Kmbova assisted me very well and helped me a lot.
4	Discount airfare site Skypicker offers travelers new ways to find cheap flights <https://t.co/dP1UnXMwVK>
5	When I was  looking for some help to book my cheapest Fare, ERIC  helped me to complete my booking with ease as per my choice. Hats off to Erics customer Service skills.
5	I was helped by Francesco, and I received my flight confirmation inmediatly, when I was worried cause my flight was next morning. He also checked my information online.So all right for me.Regards.
4	My flights were great, however I did not like that I was not able to pick my seat before hand. Also, the majority of the flights out for my time period were at 2am unless I wanted to pay a couple hundred more, but even then, the travel times were longer. Overall, I would definitely use sky picker again
5	Great service one of my flights got cancelled mid journey so I contacted skypicker who organised me new flights for the next day and refunded me the cost of my hotel. They had ndw flights offered to me within an hour.
1	Booked me on a flight that didn't exist, sent me a confirmation email for it. Only hours before the flight sent another email saying that they were having 'technical difficulties', then that 'there were no tickets available'. No customer service at all, couldn't get through to anyone, etc. Refunding my money will take weeks apparently. Essentially just a scam to stick hundreds of people's money into an account and get the interest. You can even still buy tickets for this imaginary flight through them.
2	now I bought wrong my ticket and Try to refund, but Not even a refund.I want to refund my ticket. please help me...
5	I'm very happy with the Skypicker service. They was correct, helpful, and my trip was with no problems :) Recomend high!Thanks
5	Very helpful and quick with answers. thanks to Anna T
1	Too much to say, just look at what people been complaining here about.
5	The service is extremely useful because it includes low cost flights which are not available in the vast majority of other popular flight search engines. The support staff is of good help. I had a minor problem with having my e-tickets in my home language but not in English or the language of the country I booked domestic flights in (Spanish for Latin America). They promptly provided me with e-tickets in English on my request. Special personal thanks to Lukáš Šulc and John Vacha about that.
1	all filled up but the button payment doesn't' work...
1	"I booked a round trip. and I cancelled the tickets after just 5 minutes.They didn't just played by processing. I required them processing, but they just said wait. after 5 days, they talk to me ""we can not fully refund you.""It is their mistake. I required cancellation after 5 minutes. but they didn't move fast. and they didn't announce that. I don't know that, and I carried out a refund. I very dissappointed about late progress and consumer deceit. I want to make compensation about their action and deceit."
2	I purchased flight tickets by mistake with a different agency and was refunded in full. Then I purchased tickets using skypicker and realized that there was a charge for baggage with spirit airlines and did not think it was cheap enough to justify paying for baggage so I canceled 10 minutes after reservation. Skypicker said they cannot cancel it even though the other agency I used before canceled it without any problems or charge. I had to call the 3 airlines myself to cancel which I did. They said it would take 7 business days to refund the amount and I was not told at any point that my I would get charge a lot of money if I canceled.Over a month went by and I finally got my refund but not in full. The tickets were $593 and I was refunded $460. That is $133 difference!! If I would have been told that they charge more than 20% for canceling I would have kept the tickets and pay for the baggage but I was never told even though I talked to them on the phone 3 different occasions when canceling. So I cannot recommend anyone to use them unless you are 100% certain that the tickets you buy are the correct ones cause the typical 24 hour cancellation policy that everyone else has does not apply to Skypicker.Besides making me call each airline, taking over a month to process a refund, and not telling me that they charge for cancellations unlike everyone else, they were fairly nice.
5	The booking process is easy and hassle free. Milica from the web chat help team was a brilliant help and re explained anything I was unsure of making the whole experience of booking with <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> stress free.I'd definitley recommend <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>
4	The best thing is price of flight. And everything else was great. I would recommend Skypicker to my friends, neighbors or family members.
5	My dad booked a flight on <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> but he forgot to add a checked baggage on the flight and his english was not that good enough to speak to customer service. So I helped him to call customer service in order to add the extra checked luggage and then ask kiwi to add his full name for the booking reference (as the airline told me that they may refuse to let him board if his registered name and his passport name is not the same). I called from Sweden to England and Vietnam in order to fix it. Within 24 hours, we got helps from 3 different people from kiwi customer services and Jana Zdechovanova was the last one that solved our problem. She was really humble and kind in her response to our problem. Personally I would thank David and especially Jana for helping us out as we didn't have much time to fix the ticket issue. i would recommend kiwi as a trusted agency.
5	The guys in the online customer care centre are very helpful .. I had an issue with one of my flights, I thought that I had to cancel my whole trip until I asked for Live Chat and I talked to Arsen .. He was patient on my unstable language and he could help me through to solve my crisis.---Thank you Kiwi , Thank you Arsen.
5	Thank you Bek for helping me when I had to change  details in my booking. Nice and fast!!
1	"So this is my second review (actually 3rd review since no one ever got back to me). I had to delete the first one because Skypicker chose to post my booking and passenger details publicly on Facebook. Skypicker, please reach out to me directly and not share customer details publicly. But thank you for finally answering!Here's my original review, which I'll post again. ""Thought I give Skypicker a try, but unfortuntaely had a terrible experience. They've provided us with the wrong information about our flight (ryanair). They emailed us, we have to check in at the airport (but we knew airport check-in isn't available for ryanair). Tried to check in online, didn't work, no one answered our emails. Went to airport early to sort it out with ryanair directly, but they said they had this issue with skypicker before and there's nothing they can do for us... and we had to deal with extra fees (90€) and stress. Tried to contact Skypicker customer service afterwards, but still haven't received an answer. ryanair and skypicker is a combination that definitely does not work!In reply to your public message: What you are mentioning is exactly the problem. THERE IS NO CHECK IN FOR RYAN AIR AT THE AIRPORT, so why are you offering it on your website? And what you are saying is ""once you choose it, you are trapped? Deal with check in yourself? With the information you've provided in your email (booking numner etc) there was no online check possible through the ryanair app . Even when we went to the airport they did not find us in the system by the information you've provided.Please help us sort this out and for further communcation we kindly ask you to reply to our emails."
5	Skypicker makes more things.If airline doesn't provide a ticket, they can combine ticket.ex) Airasia doesn't provide a Brunei ticket in Korea. But they combine two other tickets. So, I can travel to Brunei.
5	Thank for help to Martin Carter , fast and easy fix my problem !
5	Got response in less than minute when I needed help and was struggling. Really lovely person I spoke to so thanks to Gabriela K. Wish every customer service was as good as yours. Would highly recommend to everyone.
5	Thank you to Tanya V. for her quick turnarounds. She addressed punctually all the questions I had and come with very fast responses smile emoticon
5	Booked cheap tickets without a passport number. When I got my passport, Martin Carter was very nice and helped me to update my booking. Highly recommended!
4	HeySo I was unable to check-in anywhere (on Kiwi I was not able to type in my passport details and on <http://raynair.com|raynair.com> they could not find my booking) so I had to contact someone from the team. I was already fearing the worst as something similar happened to me before and I had to pay for another flight.Luckily, I chatted with someone from Kiwi's Team, Tom if I remember well, and he was very helpful and sent me my boarding pass in a few minutes after I communicated him my passport details.However, all of this happened because I didn't fill it in 48hours before my flight. Which is silly. Why wouldn't you be able to check-in for the flight you paid for 48h before your departure?Which leads me to another question: why does Kiwi need the passport details so bad ? Airlines and other Online Travel Agencies don't usually need them.
5	Today was a great day to support me from Spirit Company that is a good way to get some information about the princes and informacion about the Arriving and returning and any other inquiry.Thank you Miss Eva .
5	<http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> provided a great service - the self-service functionality was easy to use, and when i needed to contact them re: luggage, they were very helpful and responded very quickly.
3	Skypicker offers flights for up to 90 percent less with a cloud-based ticketing portal <https://t.co/PUy9PKhOUb>
3	@skypickercom hi I am still waiting for the call- my booking number is 491082
1	Due to circumstances beyond my control, I had to cancel my flights booked through <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com>. Ryanair refunded the money, some of it however I have not received and while most of it was returned directly to my account (there were several flights) one of the flights Ryanair have refunded and it is not in my account. I have sent several emails to <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> to see if they received the money. They are not responding.
5	I called kiwi customer support department because of a mistake I made with my ticket's details. It was a pleasure i didn't have to wait online for a service, my call was answered right away. I've talked with Thomas Jurik who was very helpfull and nice,and even contacted me later to reassure me the correction was done succesfully. Thomas, thank you so much.
1	I booked round tikets, the total price of 905663 KRW.And 2 hours later, I changed only inbound flight.When I changing the flight, I checked the change fee, 370587 KRW, on the website.But I found that skypicker charged me the change fee with the 905663 KRW again(total 1276250 KRW)And skypicker dose not refund the original amount I have paid, 905663 KRW.So skypicker charges me total 2181913 KRW in total(905663 KRW + 905663 KRW + 370587 KRW/Besides, why does skypicker charge me outboud flights again although I changed only inbound one?).I can not believe this situation.I have used a lot of flight booking sites such as <http://Booking.com|Booking.com>, <http://Expedia.com|Expedia.com>, Kayak and I have many expierences in changing flights.But skypicker's change&refund; policy is really absurd, new to me.I do love travel(I even visited Brno 3 months ago!),so please help me to be a your royal customer with pleasure.
5	Found the best rate here and was not disappointed.
5	i had a little problem, but the support was so gentle, and so patient , perfect !!!!!

5	I needed some information regarding a flight cancellation and couldn't find the information myself, so I decided to try to chat with customer support.Ana was amazing. She was able to find and provide me with all the information I needed in a really short time, she was precise and compassionate with my situation. She helped me figure out my options and that with my specific situation in mind. I have worked in customer support in the past and have encountered many customer support services of many companies and honestly, this was the most comfortable, smoothest, most productive and most pleasant experience I have ever had.Ana's really proactive approach, ability to quickly analyze what my needs were, research the conditions and come back to me in a short time with an elaborate explanation in an ordinary-human-acceptable form was impressive. She gave me all the information I needed and was supposed to have and almost without any effort from my side. I could not have done it better.Now, not every story has a happy ending, which is the case of mine, as well, because the cancellation policy of the airline company is not very favorable, however Ana's approach was something that turned my day around. She made me feel like a valuable customer. I really appreciate this. I wish everything in the world worked as smoothly. Ana is a person who knows what she is doing and how to do it and I would really love to see more people following her lead.Thank you.
3	@wizzair have found a way, but will never book with @skypickercom again. Neither should anyone else
5	I was being helped by a member of their team called Waqar. He was very professional and efficient in his dealings, making sure all my queries were answered in a prompt manner, as well as personally calling me to keep me updated on the status of my flights.Very good experience overall and it gets my recommendation
5	I had to buy a ticket for my 14 year old daughter last minute, so that she could fly home with her 20 year old brother, who already had booked his ticket with <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>. some weeks before. A friendly staff member very calmly and efficiently led me through the booking, and subsequently contacted the relevant airlines to sort out the complicated business of booking a minor, apparently without an accompanying adult. Emails confirming bookings and minor delays were sent to keep me informed. The staff really went out of their way to help. Thank you so much!
5	I had problem with my passport ID information after contacting skypicker through online chat, my information was corrected instantly. Everything was done in a 5 minutes. thank you Barbora for helping with this :)
1	Having used half a dozen online ticket agents, I felt they all pretty much did the same thing. It was only until I tried SkyPicker that I discovered how many ways an online agent can mess up on a ticket. SkyPicker’s job on my ticket was a total train wreck. They failed in six separate ways:1. Baggage Fee unusually high: The SkyPicker website claimed it was cheaper to pay for baggage charges online at their site rather than at the airport so I paid a $74 charge for my first checked bag. Then I found the airline itself charged only 400 Indian Rupees for this same service; that’s about $8. When I asked SkyPicker about this, they said that their charges were correct and came directly from the airline’s website. As the total price was not too dissimilar, I let it go.2. eTicket not issued by airline: The eTicket that arrived was not from the airline itself but instead had SkyPicker’s logo on the top. This is different from any other eTicket I’ve ever received and seemed strange. SkyPicker assured me it was for security reasons and that it would work just as any eTicket works. The eTicket explicitly said I had 7 Kg of carry-on and 15 Kg of checked luggage. This non-airline eTicket subsequently became a problem.3. No notification of outbound flight cancellation: The destination airport was closed by the government for several weeks due to an unexpected event so the outbound portion of my flight was not going to fly but SkyPicker never alerted me to this. I found out accidentally from a friend flying the same route a few days before me.4. Refund for outbound flight still not credited after months: I called the airline and requested a refund of the outbound portion of the ticket and then alerted SkyPicker that I had done this. Despite SkyPicker claiming that they would refund the outbound portion of my ticket within 10 days, the refund is still pending two and a half months later. The airline confirmed that they had refunded the agent on Dec 28, 2015 and by mid-March, no refund has been made to my credit card by SkyPicker.5. No notification of departure time change: The departure time on the return portion of my ticket was changed by the airline several times after I booked and I received no notification from SkyPicker about this.  Because of the strange situation with SkyPicker issuing its own eTicket, the airline didn’t have my email address but rather had only an email for SkyPicker so the airline sent its schedule updates only to SkyPicker, who did not forward them.6. Wrong ticket booked:  A few days prior to using the return portion of my ticket, I went online to prepay for 5 Kg of overweight checked luggage and discovered that my ticket had been booked as allowing carry-on luggage only. And this after being charged $74 for my first bag by SkyPicker and having a SkyPicker eTicket that explicitly indicated 15 Kg for the first bag. When I pointed out to the airline that my eTicket said I was allowed checked luggage, they said that that SkyPicker eTicket did not reflect the actual ticket that was booked.  When I tried to upgrade the ticket to allow checked luggage, the ticket could not be changed.  I called the help telephone number on the SkyPicker eTicket and found the number was inactive.  I emailed SkyPicker telling them I was flying in two days and asked them to make sure the ticket was changed to allow checked baggage. They emailed back saying that they would have their team look into it and correct it.  That was yesterday and now with only one day remaining before the flight, I'm still waiting.Needless to say, no matter what price SkyPicker’s site offers, I will not use this service again.
5	The website is awkward. They ask you to enter your ID info, yet there is no where to do so. I had to use the chat option, spoke to Filip and he was very helpful.
1	I did order 4 ticket flying direct from Copenhagen (3h 20m) to Madrid with a direct Iberia flight via Momondo. When I was transferred to <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> I did not have a chance to see if it was the same ticket before I had entered my payments details. They gave me other tickets with Ryanair via Brussels with a 15 hour travel time.Within minutes I did complain both by emails and phone call but Kiwi just claim tough luck for me.I don't believe all the other positive are real. It seems like a hoax-company. Check them out well before giving your credit card details.
5	Live chat was a great helped to me thank you very much jonathan
5	Kiwi is fantastic I called Italy and spoke to mr Daniele and he assisted me in an excellent manner what a great person I look forward to do business through kiwi without a doubt cheers
5	"I was worried because i didnt know how to get my boarding pass, but ""Julia"" explained everything to me and helped me a lot with all the information i needed. Thank you so much!"
3	Would you dare to take flight 666 to HEL on #friday13th? With the <https://t.co/cMMb38EOdQ> you won't need to worry. <https://t.co/4hmoi4GpXq>
5	I just talked to Marketa and answered my questions very willingly and clearly. Great customer service. So important for a flight agency.
5	I forgot to make my check in,after 4 ours will be in airport...and the air company takes for check in 45€. Thx a lot to LENKA HAVLICKOVA for making the check in for me!!!
3	Comments about skypicker, would you recommend them? #travel <https://t.co/zXshU48osS>
5	I was communication with your travel consultant Guilherme Y. who provided an excellent, fast and efficient service.
5	thanks for quick help specially Radek. he helped with all my questions.
5	I didn't take much expectation about the chat service until I met Stan, who provide an excellent service and I can feel his kindness and professtional from typing. All the best Stan with your study and life!
4	Very happy with the service will defiantly use again
5	I wanted to book multi destinations flight, I browsed a lot on internet, finally I found Kiwi and it is a lotttttt cheaper than every other agents. I tried to book but I couldn't (may be they had technical issue) and it was showing seats are not available at this price, I was so disappointed and I talked to an agent via Live chat, and he said to book on Monday. But I tried again after couple of hours and It worked. I was so happy, and the service, user interface, ticket managing and ticket documentations are awesome. I really loved it, and I would recommend to everyone for sure.
1	Firstly, you accept our transaction with less amount but now you charges us with full amount. How come you able to confirm the ticket if the payment is less??We just need cancel this booking and don't charges our credit card with full amount. Bad, bad system and management.
5	Vally and Leonardo helped me to solve a big mistake a made with my flight dates, and they were always really nice and helpful! i have booked many flights with this page and it has always been a really good choice, plus they give you info. about the documentation you need for every country you flight to!
5	Viktor did an excellent job!He helped me to change the schedule of my flight and was very helpful!!Thank you to him for the help, in more a 1st January!!
5	Really good customer service. Really helpful and super fast response on my issue. Thank you Katrin!

5	I had a very good experience with Skypicker. It made the booking very simple. I loved that they emailed you the check in as soon as they were available, that way I didn't have to pay the high costs of low-cost airlines check ins.My only problem was that in all my itineraries, they included the departing time, and the landing time (nice feature); however, the landing times in one of my flights was way off (i though because of time difference, but there was none between Berlin and London). Because of this wrong landing time (hour and a half difference); I booked a shuttle from the airport, which was completely incorrect, making me miss my shuttle and having to pay for a more expensive one at the airport. Again, minor detail...but when you're traveling and connecting to far away airports, half hour is very crucial (in this case was an hour and a half typo in all my skypicker itineraries.I would still use Skypicker anyday and recommend it.
1	I went back and forth  with them just for a price to add my son to my ticket. First they tell me someone else cancel the request and never told me till the 2nd day before my flight. I'm sorry if I don't have a ticket for my son I'm not going to bring him with me... by the time I have to drive 3 hours to the airport becauae they didn't provide the link for me to pay when request it 5x and only got one. They are very unorganized and couldnt help me with something important then cancel on not my word but someone's decision.I wouldn't go to them because they give you a hard time.Never going threw them again.
4	Kiwi offers cheap flights and nice way of communication with customer through online chat. I just wish I could be able to view my reservation in the airline website and choose the seats.
5	Clariss is a very helpful agent, with motivation for real customer care and professionalism))
4	I was booking my flight tickets from English site in English language, but I'm Russian and of course I put Russia in nationality field. I think that's because I got e-mail confirmation in Russian language. But I need it in English because I'm working in English-speaking company and need to report my expenses. I report this problem to support and then they re-send me confirmation in English in no time. Of course I prefer do not have this problem at all. I think it is reasonable to send confirmation in a language, which was used on the site during booking and I hope they fix it in the future (that's why I put 4 stars).But I want to mention that support reacted very quickly and resolve my problem in a way I expected it to be. Thanks to my support assistant Adam Jelínek!
5	Anna and Eric have done a great job providing us with super travel arrangements. More importantly we were able to change our seating arrangements in less than 24 hours to accommodate my need for an aisle seat. This is the first time I have used Kiwi travel services but it will not be the last. I highly recommend Kiwi for your travel plans.
5	Needed help for a small problem with my check-in! I have received a quick and prompt answer from Thomas M. (a very polite and good agent).Thank you very much for your professionalism. Best regards.
4	Fast, wide and friendly response.I miss a detail to answer, but I will ask again
5	Really great and professional service!
5	You can find many servers where you can find and book flight tickets. But Kiwi offers all-in-one pack and you will find him as a partner not only with trip preparation but also within the travel. Support team is 24/7 available and always willing to help.One smaaaaall technical thing - when you try to filter multi-city results you have only very limited possibilities in compare of classical one-way/return result list.
5	Such a nice change to find a flight finder app/ company with an easily findable and 24hr phone service! Very much appreciate the check in and sending boarding pass service too. I will be using <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> again and have already recommended to my friends.
5	The employer Martín helped me a lot with a problem that I had with my flight. He was so helpful and thoughtful. I am very grateful for his help.
5	Mr Pavel B. Found a connecting flight from Copenhagen to Paris after our flight to Copenhagen was delayed 39 hrs. He called several times and consulted with us on the new route and gave  us all the info so we can be reimbursed for all hotel stay and meals. He was courteous , professional and helpful.
4	Booked some flights on <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> but wanted to confirm something. Clicked on the live chat option in the website and it was answered by Jan Lukasek. Jan was polite and helpful. Always great to have nice customer service experience (and it was conveniently done via the website)!Hope my flights will also be as pleasant an experience.
5	Habe mit Valerie beim customer service telefoniert, alles super!
5	I was scare to use this service initially, but they gave the best prices on airfare and they are  quick to respond to any issues you may encounter. They do a great job and work for your satisfaction. In the  future I will be booking with them again. GreaT Job Kiwi!!Thanks to Filip my issue was resolved fast and easy
5	Great firm, booked most of my flights with them.Great personal treatment, sent an email to make sure some details about my flight and got a response in just a couple of hours, and alot of help!Martin Carter has helped me with all I needed!
5	I haven't traveled yet, but my experience so far with Kiwi has been great! We booked two flights through Kiwi on airlines we are not familiar with. Questions that I had around seating, baggage, etc they were able to answer or would reach out to the airline and get back to me with an answer. I'm hoping the service stays just as great while we travel! I worked with Denis, he was very helpful.
5	Skypicker is an amazing service that helping me to find best flight deals. Intuitive interface and instant customer support making it the best on the market.
4	I faced some problems with typing in my ID details into the system which were important for the online boarding. But after contacting the KIWI customer support, I got a reply and help for my problem. Thank you
2	A startup that finds discount flight tickets 'hidden' on airline websites just launched in the US <https://t.co/o7sD2vkPvY>
5	I had trouble completing my online check in through the Skypicker website, but using the live chat feature a very helpful and friendly representative took my details and checked in for me - very easy, quick and efficient.
5	I booked for someone else, traveling from Manila. Directed to Skypicker via Kayak. The booking process was so quick and easy that I was worried it was a scam, but flights were really booked.
5	I am pleased with the services Daria provided me!!
5	Had a scheduled flight within the next 24 hours, Vally from live-chat helped me check in and had the boarding pass sent to my email within 5 minutes. Very convenient service.
4	Grazie all'operatrice Katka molto gentile e professionale. Luca e Aleksandra italy/poland
5	I made a mistake on my booking and i had the fortune to find Viktor P. that help me out with professionalism and care. Thank you so much you save me a lot of money and save my weekend.Truly grateful.
1	BEWARE, there have been several posts below regarding flight cancellations due to technical issues. DON'T go with kiwi, horrendous custkmer service:1. Flight was canceled, no notification from carrier or kiwi. Found out from a Google notification the NIGHT before flight2. Had to call kiwi to confirm the flight was canceled, to which they explained they had no idea either.3. Communicated more than three times regarding alternate flight options for the flight the next day, each time they confirmed they would purchase the alternate tickets, but each time they emailed to advise cancellation 4. Horrible customer service, each operator was unaware of situation5. Hotels and travel plans which are booked for tomorrow are non refundable 6. Currently on their chat and not answeringDON'T GO WITH KIWI
5	Best prices and extrememely user friendly website.I've already booked my next holiday.
4	Loved booking my long journey home from Croatia via <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>Especially loved when I checked my email and noticed that they automatically checked me into all 3 of my connecting flights. Thanks Kiwi!
5	To save a time and good mood of clients - to be succsefful company. Thank you, Skypicker!
5	I am very grateful to Valentin and Aliz for solving my issue in a very short time.I had a problem with the information from the tickets and within minutes they contacted the airlines and solved the problem.Good work!
5	Good price, got e-tickets an boarding cards for the whole journey in good time. It worked very good for me :-)
5	Your assistant Alice was very bland and kind. She found nesessary information very quick and gave me even more useful data.
4	Tomas Krivanek ..... you are the best agent in this world ..very polit and helpful .... hopefully I will receive the boarding pass by today , as what you said  ;) - Awad
5	This was a pleasure to cooperate with Kiwi staff. They take care about your case as for their own. Thanks Sabina, Joseph and Kira for your support! Anna P.
5	Mila U. helped me to change some information regarding my flight, even though I am not a good English speaker, she took her time to explain me. I requested that she send me an email with all details and the  reply came rapidly.Have a good day  Mila U.
5	very goooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooood
5	I had a problem with my credit card when trying to book tickets on Skypicker and got in contact with Martin Carter from customer service through the chat and he was so nice and helpful and really cared about trying to guide me through sorting out whatever issue I was having. I would like to congratulate Skypicker on their solving-problems system.
5	I eventually booked Southwest ticket traveling in U.S. through <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>. It was very easy and fast! And even cheaper! But I am little confusing because it was my first time to use this site. And, I got confused for the ticket. But, Miroslava P was there for me and such a hepl!Thank you again!
5	The person who attended me was very kind and helpful :)I was afraid because of the problems I was having with my flight but he solved them in 5 minuts.
5	Enri A. just helped my to change my flight and his service was excellent. Thanks a lot for that.
5	Alan was super helpful and nice! He actually ended up calling me back after our initial phone call with more details to help! I called to see if I could Check my bag online, and with the airline policy there was nothing he could do. However he called me back and helped me speed the check in process for the next day!
1	"I've use this site for booking a flight, they didn't offer any OTP (secure system/authorisation system) while paying, moreover they can charhe you beyond the limit of your credit card, the tagline of their company ""find hidden cheap flights"" is a huge b*llsh*t, the price that they have far more expensive than the official price of airline. They blame the customers for their payment problems/technical issues."
5	Why did Oliver Dlouhy start @skypickercom? @mekosoff discusses that and more <https://t.co/sm8Qttj89u> @businessinsider
5	Ivana has helped me in a very efficient and quick way. In 10 minutes she save my day, and my fly :)
5	This is the first time I've used kiwi to book flights, it was intimidating to begin with but the process was simple, easy and clear. Just when my laptop wasn't connected properly, I thought the conformational emails weren't sent to me when in fact they did. Before triple checking and thinking like 'i knew something would go wrong' when nothing was wrong. I rang their costumer service up, within a short time one of their staff (his name-  Mayyas) was already on the other side of the phone guiding me through patiently, resending me the conformational emails and made sure I got them, and even waited for me to ask other questions. Their costumer service was great and Mayyas was very helpful, I'll definitely use kiwi again in the future.
1	I recently booked some flights with Skypicker for a hand baggage only fare. A number of weeks later I decided to pay for additional hold luggage via the Skypicker website (as suggested by the site).On arrival at the airport I was flying from, I found that the airline had no record of the additional hold luggage being added. I was charged at the airport by the airline for hold baggage.On my return journey I was also charged for hold luggage. The booking agent showed me the details for the flight and it clearly showed hand luggage only.I contacted Skypicker on my return for a refund of the money they charged for hold luggage ($120).  I have now sent 5 emails since the 11 Jan, including receipts for the charges incurred, and I have not had a satisfactory answer or a refund of the money. The Support email address has now stopped responding to my emails.From my perspective, I have paid for a service that Skypicker has not delivered. It is reasonable to expect a reply to customer emails and a refund when supporting documentation is provided. Skypicker clearly needs to improve its internal processes regarding additional hold luggage and its customer service.
5	RT @skypickercom: @TravellingTapir We're looking forward to reading about your journey. Don't forget to share it with us :)
5	Thank you for your promptly action to solve my seat allocated problem. Your Service is great!
5	Last week, me and my girlfriend had problems with our booking. We wanted to add bag and without help of Veronika Smidova and then Bachana Kuprashvili we would definitely really be in trouble. there was also third consultant who served us, but I dont remember her name, because we talked her through phone.  We want to emphisize that, three of them were very attentive and thank you for that!!! One thing you may improve is to give us an opportunity to make check-in by ourself. for me it would be more comfortable. ))))))
5	Melinda Ivany was the the perfect example of professionally. You are lucky to have her in your team.
5	Cheap flights through Vietnam and Myanmar, good service, and responsive to making changes as needed! Would recommend and use again.
4	The company made the chek in for me, so it  very usewasusefulld comfortable. I had no problems with the booking or payments
5	Martin Carter Excellent in service and problem resolution.
4	It was my first experience with Spypicker.At the moment i only at the booking stage. So after getting the tickets and fligth i'll return and give a higher evaluation( i hope so) :)I can tell that i had a great support from Tomáš Mužík. He was very helpful and looked for all the info i asked for.Hope to have a great experience booking here, and return.Cheers,Ivan
5	customer service is great can't thank your customer service person Aliaksandra enough for the help that I was given today ,
5	Check for economical return flight Madrid to Riga and found <http://TRAVELGENIO.ES|TRAVELGENIO.ES>. I registered all my information for the 397 Euro flight and went to complete the credit card details with this price but when I was about to finish this transaction, the price had changed for a much higher amount! This is called the bait and switch scam, remember <http://TRAVELGENIO.ES|TRAVELGENIO.ES> and avoid doing business with unethical companies. With luck I found SKYPICKER and got a much better price at almost 1/2 of what Travelgenio wanted to charge. On top of that when I made an email enquiry, they responded immediately. I think that SKYPICKER is setting a new industry standard for service and economy!!!!!
5	Communication and customer service was very good with James, especialy thanks to me for helping us :)
5	Very easy bookings, kiwi deal with check-in for you themselves. Had to use the live chat a couple of times and had great service from Sam and Kristina.
5	Booked a flight through Kiwi and through my own fault (miss spelt email address) didn't recieve a confirmation email. Thank you to Huri who was both proffessional and efficient in solving this matter for me! Many thanks Huri
5	Hi this is my first i m booking through this website. Dear skypicker can you help me,do i need any transit visa on the countiries where my flight will stay for two three hours, like if my flight has stay for 3-3 hours in turkey and London do i need any further documentation.
5	Dear sir/madamI want to inform you that today your company helped me a lot. Especially thanks to Archil who fixed my issue in a very fast way.
5	I had a flight that was canceled along the middle of my flight journey. When I called Kiwi to adjust my connecting flight it was always a wonderful experience. They truly tried to find me the best options for my trip. Bogdan was exceedingly helpful and patient as we had to call back again and again. I learned that through a rough few days of travel that kiwi would always be there to try to help navigate me to the best of their abiilites going above and beyond.
4	Skypicker is a great tool to book your low cost flights and not being worried about missing them. You can contact them of you have a problem (by phone, email and online chat) and they will help you to get to your destination, offering you a flight or a refund if they are not able to do so.A great option.
5	Marie helped me very quickly and friendly with my problem (I had a typo in my e-mail adress)
5	Just had a Nice chat with Babak Sultani. He was really helpful and solved my luggage problem! Thank you so much!
5	I am a new user of Kiwi and from my point of view it was easier to search on this site than others, It offered me lots of informations and helped me step by step with the things that I had to fill and print.  I recomand this site, easy to use, trustfully and with good offers.
5	Thanks to Luis, Marketa, Alaa and Yaketerina for all the fast help you gave me when sorting my flights out!! Highly recommend

5	Eric provided me with great service and brilliant assistance when I called the help line.
5	Appreciate very much support of Dima (Dimitry) for great patience and understanding and for handling my cancellation request expeditiously. Also thanks to Anna for her understanding who completed the final process and ensuring maximum refund is given to the customer. I'm very pleased with the staff like these at Kiwi. One advice to Kiwi management on their policy. When customers make a booking online they should be cautioned when the booking involves more than 1 PNR. Reason why I am asking this is mentioned in my history of chat conversations I had with your staff with regard to my booking # 1599031. It is an important suggestion from my side- please make a note management. Thanks.
5	The best customer service I have had in a long time. Thanks for helping out so quick!
1	I booked a connecting flight from Vilnius to Rome. I couldn't do online check-in for a flight Vilnius-Copenhagen (SAS Airlines), in the airport they explained why - I was booked with a stand-by ticket. I had to wait and hope somebody wouldn't show up for a flight. That was super frustrating and stressful as I was on the edge of loosing my holidays. Luckily, I managed to get on the plane as one person didn't show up (which was pure accident). Whilst waiting I had to call my friends and ask to cancel their plans just in case I wouldn't board on the plane and they would have to come back and get me and call my husband in Rome telling I might not show up at all.The second flight (connecting flight) Copenhagen-Rome had another issue. I got the email, saying I am able to print out my boarding pass, on the actual day of the flight, less than 24 hours before my flight. I was in my friends wedding, in the suburbs with no option for printing services. I was lucky enough to be advised by one of the guests that I am able to get a mobile boarding pass, I just have to download airline's app. I didn't know that on my own and there was no options told in <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> email. Luckily, my mobile data was enough for downloading the app as I was in the suburbs with no wifi (happy accident again). Not to mention I was lucky enough to check the email at all less than 24 hours before the flight.Overall my experience was terrible, highly stressful and frustrating and I will never use this booking website again. All the guests of the wedding and my friends are aware of my extremely poor experience with this company.
5	I am amazed at the wonderful customer service. I booked online and entered my passport expiration date incorrectly. Babak called me (in Cambodia) from the Czech Republic to make sure the problem was solved so we wouldn't have any problems with our flights. Thank you, Babak! :-)
5	Just had a good experience on the Kiwi hot line with Eric , the issue was solved in less than 1 hour and i could get my ticket for the day after with 62% discount , amazing !in the same time i have a dispute with Opodo since 2 months to be reimbursed with non-efficient hot line... we appreciate the differencehappy new year !jack
5	I was not able to check in online myself and Adam was incredibly kind in helping me to get my boarding passes.  Thank you Adam!!
5	Dealt with Sanja Helped me out with with online check in and getting my boarding passes together, Sanja was polite and sorted me out straight away with no fuss.  Very pleased.Luke
4	I found Kiwi's USA customer service number on their site (they just list the UK# on confirmation emails) was connected with no wait time, and was assisted by Mario Zarsky, one of the most lovely and enthusiastic gentleman I have had the pleasure to talk with. He helped me with my issue, and within minutes had my issue resolved. I would use this site again! A+++ for MARIO!
4	Was annoyed about the online check in, when I had to pay, but that was because of my own fault. Alaa Abdulrahman Helped me out and was great help. She completed all my details and saved me a lot of hassle.
2	@skypickercom  #SkypickerWhat is the point of selling  a little cheaper tickets when you don't grant its validity and no refund
1	This was an absolutely terrible experience.  Kiwi cancelled my return flight home and instead offered a 4 layover, two day monstrosity.  Worst of all their email telling us the flight was cancelled went to our spam folder, while they kept sending us emails with the initial flight plan still in them and claiming it was confirmed.To finally get things sorted out took four hours, three phone calls, and multiple emails.  They would only offer us flights that cost an extra $750 on top of what we'd already paid.Kiwi put us in an impossible situation, denied any responsibility, and aggressively overcharged us at every turn.  I couldn't more sincerely recommend against using this company.
5	I bought tickets for my brother and contacted Kiwi to check if he made it on the flight,(last minute purchase), they checked with flight company and let me know right away that he made it.When I picked him up, he told me that the leg from London to Montréal was is first class!  He had a great flight! (I paid for cheap tickets)Thank you <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>!Lisa
1	They booked me on the wrong flight. Then they said it was my fault and refused to fix it. Their system made an error and they expect the customer to pay for it! Tried to charge me more than $600 to get the flight I was supposed to have booked. Terrible fraudulent company.
5	Many thanks for immediate help from Yuliya S., and hoping my flight will be so comfortable  as today's asking was! :) Olga
5	The best prices and service you can ever get.
5	Excellent so far. Alan helped me out after having some troubles while booking. Gonna review again after my flights.

4	best price and good travel
5	Thank you for your support and services. You are the best!!! I really appreciate your customer support team for the support on my case with the airline. BTW, this is my first time I used skypicker! what a great services!
5	I experienced very good customer service when I had problems with uploading all of my personal information during check-in process. The open live chat is a great idea because the issue was resolved very quickly by Phana, helpful and professional person. Thank you, Phana!
5	I was serviced by one of your workers Radek. My questions were answered clearly and understandably. Thank you for your convenience
5	Thanks to Petr, I was able to be understood. He gave me some information on adding a second checked luggage even if it was not possible on Kiwi website ! :)
5	Are the best operators! Thank you very much for so quick solution and I am glad for your care!Good luck!
4	Great help desk. Good value for money for being a low fares airline. A bit tricky information concerning sizes and weights allowed in luggage.
5	i have come to trouble with skypicker's system, and their customer service person, Gabi, was very helpful and kind.so far i'm glad i picked skypicker and hope that the rest of my trip will go smoothly as it went with skypicker :)
5	When I booked my flights the booking indicated I would have no luggage included, so I bought extra luggage via Kiwi. Only after this the airline informed me, that free luggage is included in my booking.I talked to Jana via the Kiwi hotline and got an outstanding, friendly and obliging support. Jana called the airline to confirm and forwarded me the information within less than an hour. In addition she immediatelly initated the refund of my additionally bought luggage, without that I had even asked for it. Thank you very much for this great custome support!Janas service was excellent!Thank you very much for the clarification.Thank you also for already contacting the financial department with respect to refunding the extra luggage I had already bought.Your support service was excellent and outstanding. A truly great custome support!Best regards, Isabel.
5	Very pleased with Kiwi.com...Mario R. was successful at adding a passenger to my reservation at no extra cost to me! This was my first experience working with this organization and it will not be my last! I highly recommend them!

5	very useful service, the customer service on line is very efficient, thank you to Eleonora C !!!
2	First I would like to point out what I like about skypicker. Beginning with the cheap tickets. Almost all flights according to Asia are really cheap. Seems like they bought all flights off air Asia. Seriously, they offer flights that air Asia doesn't even have in their repertoire. When I try finding a flight directly with air Asia, they don't have it, but skypicker does. It's quite strange.What I really don't like about skypicker is that you have to pay a crazy high amount for lagguage. I mean 50€ for 15kg? That's ridiculous. Make it at least 25kg. this is a rip off. Just like changing your flights. I wanted to change the flight from the 8th to the 9th. First the support told me, I could not change it, cause there is no availability. Having a look at the normal search engine there were defiantly loads of flights available on the 9th. So after sending a screenshot of the search I did on skypicker just minutes later I Suddenly could find the flights also in the Change Option. Coincidence? I dont think so. Next thing that shocked me was the Price. Changing the flight to one day later would have costed just as much as two new tickets. So basically you cant change your flight. You can just buy a new one. The Person from the Support could have told me in the beginning. I would have saved lots of Time Roaming the Website for a Solution. Im fed up with skypicker.
5	HiJust want to chair whit you about my experience now.I needed some help about my trip in September, and I got this perfect help from a person called Aliaksandra very helpful, made my day perfect to get so quick and good service.Hope that you who reed this get help from the same person.Jørgensson
5	I`d like to thank Aura very much for being so profesional. She did a great job and she solved my issue very fast.
1	I just had the worst experience of my life booking a flight though this website. The price is cheap as well as their customer service. I booked a flight from Munich to Boston with a month a half of anticipation and two weeks before the departing date I received an email telling me that my connecting flight was cancel and offering me an alternative flight that I had to confirm over the phone or through chat. Untill here everything was under control.  I confirm accepting the alternative flight and before concluding the conversation I asked customer service representative to confirm the airport connection and arriving city. Over the line the flight and the airports were correct, until I received the tickets on my email, they put me leaving from a different airport that the one I was arriving to on my connection. When I call them back (on the fifth call trying to resolve the issue) the solution they offer me was for me to take public transportation or to rent a car or train or bus or whatever I can think of form that specific airport to the connecting airport that by mistake they put me flying from to my home town on a country that I don't speak the language or their laws or rules. Now because of their mistake (as they can’t not make more than one change to the bookings and even with me providing them a copy of the transcript conversation where the customer rep confirm to me twice the Airports and then giving me the incorrect one) I have to buy new tickets that will cost me twice what I pay because of the proximity of the trip dates. I'm definitely not making business with this company again and not recommending this company to anyone. They are really unprofessional and they don't care about CUSTOMERS SAFETY or wellbeing.
4	la verdad muy buena la atencion el agente q me atendio cuyo nombre es Martin Carter muy amable y en todo momento se preocupo por mi problema y intento solucionarlo lo mas pronto posible muchas gracias
1	I booked a flight on October 3 for Santa Marta to Medellin on October 5. I used the mobile website. I did not get a e-mail confirmation, so I contacted Kiwi on October 4. They said there was a typo in the e-mail adres and they fixed it. I got the e-mail confirmation, but then it seemed that they booked a flight on November 2, rather than October 5. That's odd: 2 errors in one processing, while I always thoroughly check the details I filled in. I looked up the prices of both tickets and the total price for October 5 is EUR 75,52 and for November 2 EUR 68,52. I paid exactly 75,52! Hence, this was proof that something went wrong in their system and I did select the date October 5. I contacted Kiwi and explained the situation, but they kept telling me that they have looked in their 'IT system' and that I have selected the wrong data from the start. The IT system indeed has the wrong data, but it is not the data I selected! They kept refusing answering my argument that the prices do not even match the prices for the departure dates. They explained how I could change the tickets for a fee. The fee was higher than buying new tickets! Kiwi did nothing to compensate the loss or find the best solution possible. I booked new tickets directly at the airlines website (not Kiwi) and sent a complaint to Kiwi to reclaim my money back for the incorrect tickets (which they are not will to pay according to my contact person).
4	I was in trouble to open the website that they sent me to get my loading pass..As my ticket booked by my friend ,so it's says that i had no transaction ,i was confused,Lucky I saw the chat box  so i sent my message and someone replied her name was Alexandra.L  ,and she did everything fastly after i sent my ticket detail.Thank you  the chat box is very helpful.....
5	Got tech support from Lukas who was very helpful. Been a useful website. First time using it.
4	Kateryna attended to my inquiries with precision and general helpfulness.
1	I had difficulty with changing my flight and contacted customer service to see if there could be anything done. i immediately emailed them following my mistake but it took 6 emails, all going through all different representatives for them to understand what was going on, and by that time; nothing could be done as their policy clearly states: all changes must be done 48 hours prior to departure. super disappointing as they don't offer refunds and due to their poor, or lack of, communication; missed my flight back home. thanks kiwi
5	Very good experience. We will use again in the future.Thanks to all.
5	Needed to edit my passenger information for a booking and Daniel provided excellent service by editing it for me as well as confirming my information for another booking.
5	I had a question about my boarding passes and had an online chat with Alex A. He was extremely helpful and informative! I would like him to answer my chats every time.
5	Fantastic customer service. Their speed and willingness to respond to any of my stupid queries - absolutely priceless! Well done, guys. And thanks a lot.
5	Very nice . i mis-typed my id so couldn't get the tickets.  Called up and spoke to Pahna he was very helpful and quick to understand the problem and solve it..... Nice work....  Keel it up.
1	I fly 50+ times per year but this was first time trying to book though Kiwi. I booked some flights but over 2 hours later it was still showing as Processing.  I contacted Kiwi on chat but they couldn't confirm how much longer it would take. I needed to have the flight confirmation before I could confirm other commitments so couldn't wait forever. Booked exactly the same flights directly with the airlines and saved 25% and got instant conformation. I wouldn't use Kiwi again, just a waste of time.
5	This company is simplily excellent, with fantastic services and workers. They will always attends kindly and very fast. I'm really happy to have a worked with them.
2	I just wanted to find a cheap flight ticket, but when I tried to book with this website, I wasn't made aware of the involved luggage service.So I just skipped it and thought I'd add it. However, upon checking the fee, I was shocked to see how much I was charged.I need to change my flight plan and use the free luggage service, so I need to speak with someone. I've been waiting a very long time for a reply, but every reply is the same automated message.
5	First time using Kiwi but it will not be my last.  I booked airfare and chose incorrect dates, twice.  Every agent i dealt with was very helpful and understanding.  They took every effort to help rectify the situation.  Nikola, Huri, Anton, Tomas, and one more person that I don't recall their name, great team!
1	This is the worst experience I've ever had. I'm flying in 3 days, and I've spent ALL day today dealing with these liars. First they lied and told me I had to pay $133 dollars per check-in suitcase, turns out the airline takes them for free. Afterwards, the call to tell me that one of my flights was cancelled. I called directly to the airline and they told me that the flight wasn't cancelled, but that my reservation had been cancelled because skypicker DIDN'T PAY THEM. What a bunch of liars!! And they have the nerve to tell me that they're going to try to find me seats with another airline, with which I can't even fly directly to my destination.So not only did they charge me for luggage that was free, they also lied about the flight being cancelled and on top of that, it took them one month to tell me that they couldn't pre-assign me seats even though I'm travelling with a minor.I'm definitely alerting my credit card company, because this is all FRAUD.
2	Insurance companies DO NOT PAY REFUNDS if missed connecting flights are not at least 3 hours apart
1	I buy some tickets using this website, but for private reason I change my flight to other time.But I misunderstand about price information.I just order change flight as total fee, but actually that was additional fee, not a total fee....Anyway after checking invoice, I so surprise about my payment cause of double paid compare with original order...I wrote mails to support team about this things, and I just request back to original order about my ticket.But they are decline.I really can not understand... Because departure date was still remain over 15 days. I think my request was enough for accept.I understand company's basic policy about non-refundable.But still remain enough time, they did not show some flexible action, or consideration for customer.1. I think website need to show price information more clearly about change flight, because current system is enough to make confuse for price.(mean additional charge).2. Most of Air ticket company take action some flight change when still remain for departure date. Even company have non-refundable policy, company need to consider about change request for customer.3. If company show policy for 24hours reply system, I asking to company, just do like that. Even I send mails, they did not reply my mails even over the day. Even customer's requests are too annoying, please reply request mails....
5	ONE of the best. Skypicker ranks number 30 in a list of 27
5	Excellent service, amazing feedback and many thanks to your employee named Martin. Thank you again :)
5	I am a person who does not travel often so naturally I had many questions. I had a nice chat with Serhiy who explained the whole process without making me feel like an idiot. Simply the best customer service I've had in a long time.
5	Kiwi helped me find the most affordable flight and bent over backwards for me when life handed me the unexpected. Their customer service was available and willing to help when i needed to change my flight at the last second and they were happy to help. I can't thank Thomas U enough. I plan on going through Kiwi for booking any other flights in the future. 10 out of 10 would fly again!
5	I would to take this opportunity to Mr. Mohamed And allgader for his excellent service and kind help and support was given at the time of the bookin service with a smile and very warm and welcoming too what an excellent employee I was very pleased with the way I was served with gentleman and thank youBest regardsSobhi Dahan

5	fast and furious
1	I don't appreciate this system. I want to check in on my own, due to this system, SKYPICKER made my ticket $130 more expensive. What I thought was a good deal, came out rather expensive eventuallyNever again with SKYPICKER
5	Had an issue with my checked-in luggage, Patrik helped me via chat very well, quickly and solved the issue without complications. Really good service
1	Just not happy at all!!!!!!

5	Truly amazing service with my first experience with KIWI!! One flight was delayed up to 3 hours and missed my seconds flight. They called me, e-mailed me to get in touch and sort out the issue. Booked me on the next possible flight and offered to pay up to €50 for the hotelTruly remarkable level of service from everyone via e-mail and on the phone. 5*****
5	Excellent client service. Fransesco should be the employee of the month!
5	@skypickercom You guys are cheating customers and trying to get extra money out of them. I am not going to accept it. I will fight and Win.
5	I made a mistake with my booking and someone replied to my question within seconds. They helped rectify the problem and try and find an alternative! Amazing customer service
5	Quickly reaction, full information, pleasant communication
5	We had a small problem about flight details and flights over lapping and I (Brian) called in and had the pleasure of speaking to Roman and he got my issue resolved quickly easily for me. Thank you Kiwi and Roman

WASTE OF MY TIME AND EFFORT!!!
5	Thank U Archill. Exellent  help on the chat!
4	Skypicker got me a really great deal on some flights from Sydney to West Australia. When I first booked I forgot to book my luggage and that was easily sorted out with a quick call to customer service (no wait time!).When I was in Sydney airport I could not find my booking number for Tiger Air in the e-mails I had been sent. Not sure if this was my mistake or theirs but after another quick call to customer service I had both booking numbers for my flights and a new e-mail confirming them.Really great service, will use it again.
5	Marius helped me with the check in and i am very heppy you have such dedicated employees. :)Thank you, Marius
4	Hey, I'm really thankful to Yuriy N. and his outstanding and quick job, helping me with my boarding passes. The only problem was that I cannot find any place to get my boarding passes but with the help of him it was possible.Best regards,João Pedro Dias

4	I chose to go with skypicker as I wanted to go from Istanbul to Palermo and had to connect in Roma to do so. In their conditions they assured that in case of delay the connection is guaranteed and they'd be booking us on the next flight in case we were to be missing our flight.We didn't face this problem as we had enough time for the connection but the information we didn't have was wether we had to go through transit or do the security controls all over again.Correct experience to me as I didn't encounter any difficulty.
5	I have such a pleasant experience with <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>. My sincere thank to Maria who I met during live chat. Things are solved very fast and efficient! Recommended site!

1	I tried to book a flight from Manchester to Catania for myself, my husband and son. My son has an orchestral course in Scicli and needed to take his violin with him. I had a lot of difficulty finding out what we needed to pay for the violin as the flight was with Ryan Air. I eventually found that because we wanted to take the violin as hand luggage we would have to purchase another seat which obviously increases the cost of the flights tremendously. I then went on to their booking service to book the flights but as the violin has not got a date of birth this could not be done. I rang them and was told to book 3 seats and they would send me a link. I did not receive the link that evening or the next morning. I rang at 2pm to get an answer but the person was very unhelpful and said they were waiting for the airline. I did not hear anything so I rang again at 4pm and was told that the full cost was 330 euros although the other 3 seats totalled £607 meaning that the violin was going to cost a lot more. I rang Skypickers as I could not believe it as not only were we having to pay for an extra seat but it was more for the violin than 1 of the seats which I presume if they had booked it at the right time would be a lot less. They told me that there was nothing they could do and we would have to pay the increased price. I wanted to cancel the whole thing but was told I could not do this by 1 of their managers. I said to her that it was their fault that the price had increased and I wanted the seat at the original price which if the website accommodated this it would have been. I have come across some diligent agents through the course of this who are helpful and answer questions quickly and I have also come across some who are arrogant and completely unhelpful. I have not even got to having to travel on these tickets and just hope the service is better than I have already received when we do go. They may have cheap prices but you cannot tie them down to a price. If I go abroad in future I will think twice before using this method as in the end the price may be more than going on a direct flight with another company that may allow us to take the violin as hand luggage as I have been told they do.I would like to mention my most recent contact with them with Yulia Kransenko who answered my question quickly. She deserves 5*****
5	He has been very kind and efficient! Great support!
5	The site is very user friendly. And the online customer service is really fast and very helpful ! Thanks Vladimir !

5	I was wandering about flying somewhere. Miss Katerina was very nice, very polite and so friendly. I felt like talking to a friend. She helped me to fly to Ireland or Scotland, which was a perfect fit for me. So I must say I had a great experience so far. Thank you, Miss Katerina.M.
5	Really nice service. Thank you Irina for solving all my doubts. I am waiting for the email !

4	Excellent service so far! Also by phone, Eric was really helpful. Hope there won't be any problems during the trip neither.
4	There was quite a long waiting list for the online help, but once I got through, an employee named Jakub went above and beyond to help me out with my enquiry, checking with five different airlines to help answer my questions.
5	Best wishes and thanks to Lucie and Petra.They saved my day, helping to change the route urgently.
1	not happy none of the phone numbers work on the website, no one and emailing me back about my booking i have no idea whats going on
5	I was attended by Nikola who not only did help me out very quickly but also did speak some words in my native language. A very pleasant experience!
1	"Search by Skyscanner, booked a plane to Hong Kong in the Skypicker.(Hong Kong Express).However, it had been sold cheaply than $ 100 from Hong Kong Express website. that ticket Luggage Free options 20kg(I know after reservation)My ticket must pay the luggage fee $ 150 additional. As a result,my ticket is higher the $ 250 than the HK express web site. If 250 $ can be purchased ticket.If there is a price double the difference, why not to me a refund?It's too big difference amount, so i requested a refund, but they was repeated the only words ""do not""If the amount of the ticket if unlike almost doubled, why not refund my ticket?"
4	Thanks to @AirAsia that helped us joined the flight sectors, even it was @skypickercom fault!

5	Cheers Vitalii Nikitin for the help over the phone, so far so good!
4	Thanks to Miroslava P, I was able to figure out what the heck happened to my flight. It was honestly my fault since I typed in my email wrong, so no fault on the site on that end. Miroslava P was wonderful and very patient with me!!Suggestion for the site though, can you make it easier to type in our IDs? It didn't work out for me and I had to bother poor Miroslava P again to type it in. Thanks again though!!
1	This website is fraudulent. Do not trust the reviews on this webpage as they have been made by Kiwi. This is clear because the people writing the great reviews all only have written 1 review, and they have all been posted today. Please refer to the comments section here: http:// www.sitdowndisco.c om/used -kiwi-com-wasnt- scam/ as well as doing your own research on <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com>, as well as their former name Skypicker, for which reviews can be found here:  http s://www. <http://gripeo.com|gripeo.com> /custom erservice/skypicker****i had to add random spaces in the links so they could be posted here, so just remove them and the links will work.
5	It was the first time, but i'll use it again for sure
5	Cheap. Easy. Great way how to find book and buy ticktets.

5	I've been trying to buy the cheapest flying tickets and this website drove me questionable. Main problem was different prices in different currencies. When I saw tickets in CAD, It showed me only ridiculously expensive tickets.When checked in Korean,however, the total price was almost half as the price looked in CAD and flights shown in Korean were not even existed when I tried to see in CAD. I wanted to ask these things to agent so I tried to reach them, but couldn't contact anybody because every telephone line was too busy. So I used live chat and met ALAN. Alan understood my problem and checked what went wrong. Alan helped me figuring out the cheapest flights and kept asking me was there anything he(or she) help with. I was deeply touched with Alan's help. Thank you kindly.
5	The team was so patient and friendly . They answered me many times for all questions  especially the person how called Anas Dallal . He talked with me for long time on the phone to explain everything step by step to pay for the bag . Really thanks skypicker team so nice and easy to contact you.And big big thanks to Anas Dallal because he found the solution to my problem.
5	This was a great experience - from the great prices to the excellent customer service.  Varvara was very helpful and manage to satisfy all my requirements.  I will definitely be back again.
5	Just got my cousin's passport details sorted as i had made errors on the expiry date, got in touch with Tomas on live chat and he just made changes literally in seconds! 5 Star Customer service.Highly Recommended. I am definitely using skypicker again for future travels.Keep up the Good Work! Really appreciate the service!
5	I was talking with Michal for a 15 minutes, He was very patient because my english is not perfect. He answered all my questions and resolve all my doubts. 5 stars, no doubt.
5	Anh was very friendly and helpful!! Thanks for answering so quick.
5	I had a enjoyable experience using Skypicker for the first time. I will definitely use this website in near future for booking my next flight.
5	Excellent cooperation. Staff was willing to help with re booking.
5	I was missing a confirmation email for an upcoming flight and Patrik did a great job reassuring me the flight was confirmed and sending me the confirmation email. He was prompt, very responsive, and patient. I was very pleased with his customer service skills.

5	Thanks a lot, <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com>!
5	We made our self's a mistake when we bought the tickets and Anna helped us to solve it in an incredible, excellent and very quick way. We will be very grateful always.
1	Should fly on a monday, and lufthansa was in strike and i called skypicker on a sunday to make sure my flight was on time. They said the flight was moved to another airport and cancelled, but in fact the flight was going on time and wasnt cancelled. I had offcourse paid new tickets in the evening via skypicker and it costed med about 100£ ekstra. When i contacted them about a refund they said that it wasnt their fault, and the wrong information was just bad luck, and i would get no refund.1. fast but bad service2. doesnt understand your situation and give you bad advice3. No refunding a customer that was wrongfully treated4. Not addmitting they ma a mistakebe carefull to use skypicker- big risk! cheap but in the long run maybe cost more than a trustworthy firm.
5	Easy to use and very high value for money.
5	Fight change from El Calafate back to Buenos Aires was change very quickly. Service outstanding by Nino K., just for a little bit of money i was able to spend 2 more days at Torres Del Paine.Many Thanks,Aleks
5	What a great experience and wonderful customer service. All my questions were answered quickly and any changes I had were done thoroughly and the response was quick!
5	I had excellent service from skypicker in general being able to attend my needs even though i ordered my ticket only 5 days before flight. The experience only got better with the costumer service provided by Emre T
5	Easy booking and a great service. I had some trouble with the credit card and within some minutes in the live chat I got resolved any problems of my booking. Thank you Martina N for your friendly chat and a great service!
5	My friend bought tickets for me by <http://KIWI.com|KIWI.com>. And i just realized that there was no baggage. I ask help via chat on the web-site and Maria answered immediately. so it took me few min to add baggage. just waiting now a confirmation on my e-mail as payment was already charged. also i read a lot of bad comments about <http://KIWI.com|KIWI.com> that they can cancel ur booking and dont inform you. So i was a bit afraid of that cause its my first time to buy tickets on <http://KIWI.com|KIWI.com>. So Maria insured me that this kind of things can not be happened. My flight is on December so lets see how it will go.for now i wanna say thank you to Maria who answered very quickly and helpfully!
5	It was helpful. Just as I like it. I'm not one for reviews so.
5	"The agent ""Tamara"" is very effective. He/She fixed my email problem and sent my booking confirmation instantly."
5	I've asked about certain feature that I miss (import reservation created as non-registered user into account) and he replied that they can't do this right now, but will probably made possible in future. Nice :)
5	Jiri helped me solve my problem within 5min of me realising (in the middle of the night!!) that i had forgotten to check in to my flight! So pleased and i will be using Kiwi for all of my upcoming travels!
5	I had some problems with my flight and my agent Miroslava P solved everything in a couple of minutes. I'm super happy of the service, thank you!
5	Mr. Pavel service was excellent, Sky picker provide a very good service for economic travellers, Thank you.
4	Thank you for all the information. They have great staff and they help you anytime.Tatiana realy help me. Have a nice day and travel safe :)
5	Martin Carter,thank you for the help you greatly helped me whith my boarding pass. Next time I also will be use Skypicker for book of my flight.
5	Had issues with delayed flights, Skypicker got back to me straight away with help and what to do next. Friendly helpful and speedy.Also, booking my journey through SkyPicker was actually cheaper than booking direct!
5	iam very satisfied to fly with skpicker so it is so nice airplain i say every one to take my advice and honestly i wanna stop other airlines
5	Very happy and the client attention really great. They helped me on every step, i have to cancel a flight for a web problem and they did it. I am a couple of days far from my flight but until now I am very satisfy with the service!
1	They booked my flight for the wrong day. But never told me.
5	I've had to deal with Kiwi a lot over the past few days, as I was slowly thinking about then changing travel plans. Your team was responsive, thorough and patient. Mohammed especially stood out to me, and was kind, efficient, and prompt in dealing with my requests. Thank you so much for all of your help!
4	Thank you Neil for helping so fast with my doubts! I had to call in another moment, and I also receive a excellent attention by phone! Congratulation for customer service!
5	Would like to thank Nina for a good work that she has done and the very accurate provided service. Really appreciated.
4	Babak thanx for helping me this morning ! You were so helpful and patience and I have my ticket now :relaxed:
5	"I receeived excellent customer service by ""Eva"" when my booking needed changing. I will warmly recommend Skypicker to friends and family"
1	"So I used <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> for the first time to book a flight from Bali to Melbourne,  while I was checking the time I am sure it was direct but after the booking confirmation I found it with 11 hours wait in Townsville!Emailed them on the spot while the booking was still processing to cancel, but got a confirmation email later that it is booked.Now even asking for some help to change the date 2 days earlier but through the website it would charge me more to change my flights than if I book a new one, support was asking me questions about my booking and the change prices etc that I would expect them as a travel agent to know since they managed my booking. And their response were ""We can't lower the airline price!""Oh, and since I used an agent Jetstar won't let me change the booking as well...Never again!"
1	Can someone competent and fluent in English please contact me from corporate? After 4.5 hrs on phone with possible canceled connecting ticket before 14.5 hr direct to Brisbanr; I'm a bit irritated. (No) Thanks @kiwicom247
4	Babak was very helpful on the online chat! Great!
5	Thank you so much Babak! Very helpfull, nice and easy to understand! All you could ask for in an online service:sunny::sunny:
5	I had a good experience with them. Quick to reply if you need anything. First time using the service and simply booked a one way. It would be pretty hard to mess that up. Cheers.
4	Overall, I am absolutely satisfied with SkyPicker - it allowed me to book the ticket cheaper than on the airline's website or anywhere else for that matter.Everything went as smooth as it can be BUT since all of the purchases go through the intermediary, I could not check-in online and had to do that in person. Also, for the same reason, I could not check my booking on any of the other tracking sites (the reference number is only for internal use), which made me slightly anxious and suspicious. And all the messages about no-refund policy didn't make it any better, although I do understand the importance of these disclaimers.However, I got everything I was promised, while paying less - that's totally enough to me ;)
5	Thank you Henry for a quck and effective assistance.
5	Quick and honest service. Spent some time trying to solve a minor problem with an airline company and <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> solved it almost instantly after a chat conversation. Good work, Nina and colleagues. Keep it up!
3	I bought a flight ticket from Vietnam to Bali and @skypickercom divided the booking number in the transit in Kuala Lumpur
4	I called kiwi to ask for the boarding pass, and a lady in the customer service gave me quick information and she was really helpful abd the information was understanding and in the end I got my boarding pass really quickly
4	Although the trip took 20 hours for a direct flight that usually only takes 8 hours, I managed to save some money and see a whole new country thanks to a 10 hour layover. I needed to change my flight just 50 hours before my flight was scheduled to depart, and the customer service representatives were kind enough to work diligently in the short time we had available to change the flight. I am appreciate of their efforts, as my parents were in the hospital and I feared I would not be able to delay my flight to help them. Luckily their hard work paid off and I had an enjoyable trip!
5	I was speaking with an agent named Lukáš over the phone. Very kind and helpful. I am really happy with the service and the fact that they do their best to help you despite being limited by the airlines.
3	RT @GregorSIDERIS: #cloud Skypicker offers flights for up to 90 percent less with a cloud-based ticketing portal... <https://t.co/mqIYpOf7E5>…
5	Chat agent was extremely helpful and polite and did what he said he would do by following up with the airline and resolving my issue , great work for a good price !
1	I just bought ticket with skypicker, and I hope everything Wil go well, I see that people have trouble with Ryanair and we go with Ryanair from Milan to Bucharest!!!!!
4	I have used Skypicker for some times and i am very satisfied with the service and with the staff, which is very helpful, specially Sabi J. RRibeiro
5	Miroslava P helped me to check in ; she has been amazing :)
5	I booked two tickets today, only thing that went wrong is the payment of the second ticket, the Kiwi customer service helped me to resolve the problem within 5 minutes, and as I was talking to Neil the support solve the issue, so all in all I received a top notch service overall.
5	I had a problem and Lenka helped me fast and in a very professional manner. Thx!
5	Finding flights is easy, prices of tickets are quite good. Ticket reservation is easy and fast, and terms of service are presented clearly.When You need to add a service (eg. another baggage), You contact Kiwi through a form and they respond in timely manner. Their overhead costs for adding a service are more than fair.
1	My flight was cancelled by the airline more than 1 month prior to its departure. Only after arriving at the airport did I find this out from the airline. After speaking with the airline employee, he showed me in his booking system that on 5 different occasions, they contacted Skypicker and let them know of the cancellation, but not once did Skypicker notify me of the cancellation.  I tried to contact Skypicker via live chat.  I did not receive any response for more than 2 hours, at which point there were no other rerouting options available.  On 5 different occasions I was told this error was due to an email server upgrade at Skypicker. Each time they admitted their wrong doing, but have yet to live up to their service commitment.  I was promised on a limited refund for our cancelled trip. To add insult to injury, Skypicker claims that I broke their service terms and conditions because during the 2 hours I was unable to connect with them, I spoke to other airlines seeking an alternate route, Skypicker refused to refund a large portion of my rebooking costs because they unavailable agent didn't offer it to me before I made the rebooking. This company's communication with me has been an absolute joke. They have repeated lost my emails and have made multiple promises to get back to me within a certain time frame.  Only after I contacted them over and over did they finally respond to my inquiries.  It has been more than 2 weeks since this incident and I have yet to see a single penny returned to my account.  Stay away from this company at all costs!
4	I initially was frustrated with kiwi as there was a miscommunication when tying to change my flight and I was told to pay but once resolved I was very happy with the outcome and Serhii Kiian was great! I would definitely use kiwi again!
5	Roman was a great help! Very satisfied with his service!
5	The representative, Katerina, at <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> really helped me through a bizarre series of requests with grace and ease. I needed to cancel a reservation (after erroneously double booking myself for the same trip!) and she managed to help me through a refund process. She was a delight. Thank you, kiwi!
1	"Kiwi is a fraudulent booking site.  Payment was taken from me and then they started demanding more money AFTER I PAID.  I booked two tickets and they refuse to cancel both of them.  All they want is more money, more money sir.  This ""business"" is a perfect example of a bait and switch SCAM WEBSITE.  They leave me no option but to do a time consuming CHARGEBACK with my credit card to get my money back."
5	Nikola was really helpful and she solved all my problems :) Thank you
5	Eric gave is very good assistance in thinking about our ticketing and our route.
4	The customer service staff was very helpful in resolving my questions, particularly regarding baggage and checked luggage fees.  They responded quickly to my questions and helped me to negotiate fees.  All the documentation I received was clear, complete and appropriate.  But I won't be able to give a full report until I have actually completed my trip -- one never knows if there will be snags until one is at the airport and until one reaches the destination.

5	Thank you Katrin! You have to be very lucky to have helpfull and polite and nice people like Katrin! Excellente service we got from her!!
5	The booking process is easy and if there is any mistake the custom service is very efficient. My problem was solved very fast by Juan Costa
5	I booked a flight with the wrong date (one week later - my mistake). I contacted the support. Nina, the support agent cancelled the booking and booked the correct date for a very good price. The price of the flight was 10 EUR more expensive, but they covered the differnce. I doublechecked it on flight search engines. What a great support! 5 Stars! Special thx to the support agent Nina
5	I started using Skypicker's flight search because it allows search without a destination. This way I could search by departure within a certain timeframe and choose my holiday destination last based on best choice given my constraints. I found it smart, easy to use, and dependable. After I booked, I had some trouble getting my passport in order and phoned Skypicker customer service and spoke to a real human within a minute or two which I was pleased with. Skypicker was not able to help at all with even a minor change because of how their orders are handled by the airlines, but luckily I was able to contact the airline directly to resolve my issue. Would use Skypicker again, would recommend.
5	Me ha atendido Enri A. muy amable, simpatico y me ha resuelto mi problema… volveré a usar esta compañía. Hay un gran equipo detrás!!.A. Enri has treated me very friendly, sympathetic and solved my problem ... I will definitely use this company. There are a great team behind !! .
5	Fast and efficient service. Would book a specific seat, which wasn't an option on the site. Wrote on the online chat and got an fast answer. Good customer service!
1	I had a pessima experience with skypicker . I bought ticket from Perth to Queenstown but I could not go that day. Then I spoke to them by chat to rebook thr ticket. I tolk to assitent, she gave me an option of another day and sent a link to make payment for up to two hours and it was done . Everything is OK? No, 7 hour later they sent me an email saying that not made the reservation because the value had been changed . They sent the number of the reservation and then wanted to charge more about 350 euros. As if that was my problem. Conclusion : I have lost my tickets and other valuables because they had already paid car rental and hotel in Queenstown and to refund my money just between 7-10 working days . I never buy anything here. Terrible service and zero respect for the consumer .
5	Well.. I was skeptical using kiwi at first.. The more and more I interact with the team the more is am a big fan... I have to say.. I did have some issues on flight changes and so forth... And used their online chat service with a Tomas jurik... And the friendly support and understanding only build more confidence for me using kiwi. Great support.. Keep up the great job.

5	Thank you for relentless service for the customer who demands many changes !
5	This was the first time I used this site to book my flights for Singapore from India. It gave me best rates. However, they booked wrong flight while coming back. But when I followup with the team they helped me in providing me the reimburement for my 2 days extended stay & booked a suitable flight for me. I would like to give special thanks to Thomas Knox who follow up with  us for flight booking & reimburement process.
5	Thank you Selorm for supporting us with our problem with Passports ID. You were very quick
5	Made mother of goof ups in my bookings and Lucie helped me with great promptness. Thankfully I didn't have to pay anything additional. Again thanks Lucie. Hopefully I will get my refund for the duplicate booking haha!
5	I accidentally deleted all my mails including my bookings, where all my e-tickets were. I then decided to contact skypicker on their live chat. A very nice and helpful customer service worker named Victor S. sent me the bookings and did the online check-in for me, since a check-in at the airport could cost an additional fee. He also informed that it was important that I printed out my tickets.This was pleasant, and I would like to say thank you very much to Victor S.
5	Questions regarding my flights.Online chat service helped me out, great communication!! Thanks Dorota!!
5	No problems, booking was easy. No issues with the flights. No hassles.
1	Getting to my destination was no problem intact I was quite impressed with the overall experience. The issue came when I got to the airport 2 hours before my 8pm flight time on my itinerary, only to find they had mixed up the departure and arrival times on my itinerary. So I wasn't able to board my flight that actually left at 6:30. I called straight away after realising what had happened. The person I spoke to took the details and told me I would be called within an hour to get it sorted. So I sit and wait. 2 and a half hours later they call and tell me they will book tickets for me for the next day. Firstly asked if a hotel would be provided and was told they would only cover 50 euro. Which isn't going to cover it and 10 euro for food which would get me two meals for 24 hours. I asked if the provided flights were the earliest possible. I was assured that they were.So I asked if there was any other option. A refund so I asked how much and was told I would get 120 euro. When my whole trip cost me 500. Wouldn't have taken much to keep me happy. I understand mistakes happen but for me to end up out of pocket for your mistake is just not good customer service.
5	I had a good experience with your support's service. The only thing that I would change is to give to people all the information that they need to change something in their prenotation also by yourself.
5	Had to make a number of last minute changes to our booking and Tomas was very helpful in getting us all sorted.  Thanks again, will use your services in the future.
5	Kiwi offered a spotless service, on-time, brief and with relevant information.
5	After reading some reviews, I felt a little nervous, but there was absolutely no problem with my trip. I travelled from Tokyo to Beijing to Chicago to Washington. Check-in procedures are no different than with an ordinary booking (aside from you cannot do anything from the airline's site, but that's unimportant). I had around five hours between each leg of my flight and I was really worried about connections, but there were no problems. However, I did have an exceptionally lucky trip in that no planes were delayed at all.One thing to note is that the company seems to limit baggage based on the flight with the most restrictions and advises similarly on meals. My international flight allowed two bags but the US domestic one only one. It's fine because limits are limits but I still felt confused when I was researching about it. It's better in the end I suppose since you go in with the lowest possible expectations.Anyway, the staff was also immensely helpful and courteous. Thank you to Aurelija for your help! Would recommend this service to anyone (albeit, anyone with strong nerves and a bit of free time in case something does happen to go wrong).
1	Please don't book the ticket with Skyjacker if you don't want to get stress. worst booking system. they charged double time and no refund. even they haven't send the ticket. such a bad responsible. I lost $1,500 and they don't care about this. please stop horruble business and don't scamming peoples!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1	"Really anoying Company, no boarding pass on e-mail as promised in written and by phone resulted in extra fee to Ryan air (lucky them) at check in - no refund - "" we are so sorry"" -"
1	I lost the money! Definitely do not recommend!PS: By the way, wildly surprised by the amount of positive feedback SPECIFICALLY ON THIS SITE!
1	I have never experienced such a slow chat... and such a robotic operator on the other side. I would expect at least a minimum of a human touch, a 'enjoy your flight', 'enjoy your long weekend', 'I understand, let me take care of your case', 'no worries, I'll be more than happy to help you out'. Sending out a smiley only when asking for a (POSITIVE) review is total rubbish... we are not at the fish market, wake up and put some effort into your job Jan, especially for such easy and simple requests!!!Your job is to turn upset customers into happy ones.. not the opposite!!!
5	Thank you Kiwi for a great booking experience. We experienced a very long delay at the airport and the airline didn't respond on our emails. We spoke to Michaela from KIWI at the live chat because we didn't know how to get in contact with the airline and she directly helped us. Thanks and we will definitely book with Kiwi again!
5	Had to switch between personal ID and passport number for a ticket, but Lorena was more than helpful and got it done fast. Many thanks
5	The greatest costumer service EVER. Thank you Hanna for the help. YOU ROCK!!!!
5	The service of your company is good
1	I wanted to switch my flight to one day later for a trip 5 months away. I contacted kiwi,com 3 days after booking. They told me there would be a $82.34 change fee for a $96.56 fare which included a $35 baggage fee. The change fee would be more than the initial fare. I asked them to refund the $35 baggage fee since I would not be using it. I was told no. They suggested i just make a new booking since it would be cheaper than paying the change fee. <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> is practicing legalized crime. Any company that is so unscrupulous should be boycotted. I would steer away from <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> to avoid the possibility of losing your hard earned money.
5	My experience booking with Skypicker was easy. I also got itinerary reminders via E-mail which I found very useful in order to do my web check in 24 hours prior departure time with the airline, something I often forget to do.
4	Never used SkyPicker before but would think twice about using them again.
5	<http://SkyPicker.com|SkyPicker.com> is very professional and helpful. every time I was in contact with them, they did their best to help me . Especially I want to mention their travel consultant Aamer Tagledin who has helped me a several time. He is so customer friendly and called back each time as promised. he is very professional and helpful . He did everything too help me and succeeded. he is really a good travel consultant that did everything easier for me including advising me about the hotels in Hurghada. It was a pleasure to talk to him and to deal with <http://Skypicker.com|Skypicker.com>
5	When stumbling across skypicker wasn't sure if it was reliable or not. However I booked through them and that was a good decision. They emailed me my tickets and also my boarding passes. It was a good service and I would use again.

5	We had problems doing the online-check-in and a nice woman named Anna T. helped us and did this for us via chat. The online-chat is very useful and a great opportunity to ask questions and interact with the agents. Thumbs up!
4	The flights and booking process was fantastic. My recommendation would be to send a few follow up emails leading up to the flight. I had to search back months in my emails to find my flights. Would defiantly recommend in the future
4	Had a problem checking in the day before departure..went on the online chat with Lukas Janecka at 11pm and he helped me..big thanks..would recommend <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> to others
5	I booked a flight on Kiwi and by some mistake my name was written wrong.After few minutes of calling with mashine some traveler assistant helped me to fix this mistake. Her name is Markéta Galiová and I would like to thank her for her care. She is very kind and nice. So I recommend this company.Thank you!
5	I talked with Júlia and she was Very educated. My problem was soluction in few minutes. Thank you!
1	Terrible service. I booked a flight and kept me waiting to finally confirm that the flight was fully booked. And now with other search engines i can find any other flight either. You make me waste time and money. Will ensure to recommend not to use your page! Grrrrr.... i wish you have an office!!!!

1	"ABSOLUTE THIEVES. Beware of this so-called ""travel agency!"" I booked three tickets LIS to DCA through Skypicker and added a bag to each passenger's ticket. This cost about $90 for the checked bags. Now I am told by Skypicker email that they weren't able to get a checked bag for the flight (I called the airline, SATA, and it turns out  they ALREADY INCLUDE a checked bag with every flight. So now Skypicker says that I should save a copy of the ""receipt"" for bags and that they will refund me ""later."" There will be no receipt because the bags were free AND Skyjacker has my money."
5	I was very annoyed when I found out I could check-in online 24 hours before my flight but the way Lukas attended to me via kiwi live chat was amazing. He had the right words and helped out with my online check-in..he took my anger from 10 to 0... Service very amazing...thank you.
5	"Paola,  at the phone line of Customer Service of <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> handle my flight reservation cancellation very patiently going with me over the phone while I was on line  filling the form.

The only draw back was that <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> sort of ""hides"" the phone number of Customer service, obviously attempting to force people to do it themselves on line, and I had to Google search their list of numbers in USA, but once I called, I didn't have to wait long at all to talk to a friendly and efficient human been! Thanks Paola! Edgardo Cambon"
5	Je suis agréablement surpris qu'il y ai un service telephonique pour repondre  nos questions et nous rassurer sur nos craintes lors de la reservation d'un billet , J'ai eu affaire à Eric qui a su repondre a toutes mes questions et s'est montré tres rassurant quand aux demarches que j'avais à faire pour la resevation de mon billet . En plus d’être claire et precis dans ses reponses, il m'a donné des conseils supplémentaire au quel je n'aurais pas pensé , le tout tres sympathiquement . Je me dirigerais vers kiwi pour tout à présent . Merci , Stevens.

5	Veronika and Aliz did fantastic work helping me change my booking at Kiwi. With a short call and chat we were able to figure it all out and do it flawlessly. Thank you again!
5	Thanks to Travel Consultant Daniel and his quick response i can stop worrying about my flight tickets and start enjoying the upcoming flight :) The live chat service is a great way to get a quick response. Thank you again!
1	I booked a connecting flight through Kiwi as I was in a rush. After booking it, I checked the individual airlines and noted that Kiwi charged me an extra $60 on what would have been a $200 fair (I ended paying $260 instead of $100).
5	Very helpful and available. Solved a problem I had with my booking, were relatively quick in replying my emails. Also ended up with great seats arranged by them for me and all of that for free.
5	Using the online chat was faster than a phone call, and Zuszana S. resolved my query quickly. Thanks!
5	My experience so far with Sky Picker has been great so far.  I have spoken with support twice now.  The latest was with Tomáš Jurík.  Each time the support representative handle my questions very well.  I hope my experience with Sky Picker will be this good throughout the whole process.  I fly in one month!
4	Saskia was great! Understood me and helped me in a heartbeat!
5	Keep in mind that Ryan Air is a bus service. Seats don't tilt back, no tray tables, no seat pockets - what you get is low cost and efficient travel. If you have any amount of luggage more than a day pack or briefcase, pay the extra fee and check it - it is worth it.We changed our reservations - Kiwi handled it expeditiously and efficiently. There of course was a fee, but it was very reasonable [compared to the major airlines] and all went without any hassles.Our booking with Kiwi was overall excellent and we definitely would use them for our next trip.
5	Hi, i am Tornike kartozia i always use your service. While one of my transit travel i had problem in Ukraine airport i was denied to leave the country and i was not permitted to my flight. So i urgently required for new tickets. With the help of you i got the tickets very fast. I want to thank you guys for your help! You did a great job. Especially i want to thanks Natalya Petrishina, Valeri and Kristina. You have the most experienced and friendly team. Thank you for your support.
4	Very easy and very helpful, they are very good at answering questions, even for a first-timer like me, that never set foot in an airport before, they had someone helping me within 5 minutes :)
5	I had an issue due to an airline changing their flight time and James helped me so much. He took his time with me, calmed me down by telling me how great Rome and Greece are, and he truly cared to help me to his best ability. In the end I was able to figure out the flight situation, but it was so nice to know he had his team trying to find a solution for me even after we hung up. That's truly excellent customer service. From now on I will be searching skypicker first before any other site for flights. Thank you so much James, you are awesome!
4	good service, any question was answered on time, don't have to waist time on online check-in, boarding passes were sent on my email.
5	"Skypicker""s service is excellent. It is smooth and  they do not charge exorbitant administration fees like the other agent I used last time."

2	Do not use <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> if your flight is anything other than non stop and you are in the US. Each leg of the flight is a separate booking.  We got to the airport and found oit the airline makes you pay for carry on (Spirit Airlines).  Because it was cheaper to check, we opted to do that, but it became a major hassle because we had 2 separate confirmation numbers.  If you want to call <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>, it is an international call.  Never again!
1	Hi.I booked a flight last night at 8.20pm and I kindly received an email saying that you are thanking me for using your services and that you are now processing my order and that you will send me my booking confirmation and my e-ticket within 30 minutes.All good so far, only to recive a text and an email, 2 hours later...2 hours telling me that you regret to inform me that the airline has changed the price of my flight and that you have not been able to process my order. How sorry are you really??? After 2 hours you decided to inform me that if I still want my flight tickets I need to pay an extra 95.91 pounds?? Are you serious?What kind of service are you providing? The one where you lie to people??I would love to have an answer and I want my flight to be as much as I already payed for it because that's already more than enough!!! If not you can pay for the difference for beeing more than unprofessional !!!!!!!!
4	Overall OK.  Could not check-in at the self check-in counter (Jetstar) with our passports, had to use only the booking number. Overall happy.
5	Forgetting to book checked in baggage can be costly, and it's a very annoying mistake as to boot.Luckily, an Agent was with me within moments. And my problems were solved within 20 minutes; quickly and efficiently.Anna T (via LiveChat) really made my evening - by dealing in excellent service, quick on the dials, and a sense of humour as well.Who'd have thunk leaving in good spirits after I'd made a costly mistake on my part? Certainly not me.I accidentally ended the chat, but if you see this Anna, great job  I'd certainly be cool with choosing Skypicker next time as well, and recommending it too, vouching for services well-done. :v:
5	I traveled recently to Bali from Ho Chi Minh City and booked my flights through Skypicker. Skypicker provided me with everything I needed, including etickets, boarding passes, and important information on flights and boarding times. I had no problems with Skypicker. It is unrelated but there was an incident on a Citilink flight departing Denpasar for Surabaya in which a passenger was yelling and hitting the side of the plane before takeoff. The plane let the passenger off and had to get his luggage off of the plane. This took over an hour, and there was no explanation from the flight staff about what was going on. Because of this, I nearly missed my flight out of Surabaya. It wasn't Skypicker but I thought it was important to include. I would definitely use Skypicker's services again.
2	"THEY ARE HORRIBLE! Avoid them by any means.I had several connecting flights, which were not reported to the airline of my first departure. Therefore, the airline refused to allow me to fly. When I called KIWI to fix this problem, they had no solution. After speaking with several reps, they said: ""we can not do anything about that."""
5	I had reached out to kiwi's help desk as my airline had rescheduled the connecting flights which made it impossible for me to catch onward flights. Kristina Buresova and Vojtech Oplustil went out to the way to support me and find an alternative flight. Very impressed with their professional approach and customer service. Will definitely come back to kiwi for next booking.Saksham
5	I found that the date on my flight was incorrectly booked.  I chatted online with Huri who was very helpful and polite.  He was able to change the date for me by working with Miroslav.  The date was changed for no additional charge and I am on my way to Spain.  Thanks to these 2 great agents
3	#skypicker sold me a flight that ceased operating two months ago & didn't find an alternative or compensate! #shameful #avoid @whichairline
5	It was my pleasure to work with your worker Miroslava P. . She works fast and correct. 4 board cards for extreme short time, thats amazing! For sure I will use this company again! Thank you!
2	I tried twice to book flights in Colombia but kiwi refused. Kiwi's security system protects me but just refuse I use its companies to travel during my holidays. Because it's not strange that a french guy with a french credit card book in France for flights in south America ... And you are not able to help me ... You seem slave of your security system. And you're hotline advice me to book with an other companie ...
3	The tickets were a great price, but they were going to charge $70 per checked bag! That's how Kiwi was planning to make up for the low airline fare. We found this kind of sneaky. Not sure if we will use them again.
5	thank you very much to skypicker and Leonardo for their help with the flights, I did not think they would return the call to solve my problem . cheers
5	I would like to give a positive feedback to Mr Albert Martey. I had a massive big issue with my booking and I had to call the customer service . I had the pleasure to be helped by Mr Albert Martey, he was so kind and professional. He helped me also if at the begin of the call I was rude and arrogant to him. I think he was extremely professional, calm and nice. He resolved my problem and made me happy. I hope this SUPER POSITIVE feedback can help him to improve his career and his skills! Thanks a lot Albert (and sorry if i was rude)
5	The most helpful and kind customer service I have ever experienced with booking flights. Will most definitely use again for future travels. I highly recommend!
5	Your assistance was meaninful, consistent, permanent, and trully useful along the whole booking and travelling process.
5	Just livechattet with Natalya at skypicker - helpfull and quick. First time I use this company and I like how it is going so far:)
4	I'd like to thank Irina for giving me the information needed for my upcoming flights. She was very pleasant and nice to take time and explain what to do and what it is going to happen with my reservation.
5	Hello,I travelled around the world (with my bicycle) and this is probably the best service I ever had. I dealt with Gabriela Korosiova on chat and she was unbelievably friendly and helpful.Thanks a lot to the whole company!Lucas
5	First time making an online booking through Skypicker. Contacted them through their live chat because I needed to do my flight check in. Pleased by how helpful and fast the staff in charge was. I got my boarding pass right away via e-mail. Thank you again.
5	Skypicker has been so helpful to me organizing my flight that I am greatful for the service I received. First of all my flights were too complicated to plan, flying from one country to another do using a tool like Skypicker I made sure every plan went smoothly. Having boarding passes in advance also helps a lot making travel much easier.
3	Move over #Google #flight tracker! @skypickercom has hit the United States: <https://t.co/awy2rmC4Nx> #travel #airlin
5	I was helped welcome every time we needed it. I was contacted by phone or chat, or email. I recommend. Among the agents we worked with are: Teona, Timothy R, Gabriela, Andrea, Barbora. Thank you.
5	Irina, my customer representative was extremely courteous, professional, friendly, and helpful.
5	Alex A. helped me perfectly, so I can't complain about something. Everything was fine! Can recommend this service and this guy.
2	A startup that finds discount flight tickets 'hidden' on airline websites has  launched <https://t.co/19jrHWgsDM> <https://t.co/lSChP9xaAi>
5	Filip M assisted me with correcting wrongfully entered data during my reservation process. Very professional and service oriented attitude. Thanks
1	Very shady agency. If you don't want to lose your money, check out more reliable ones or buy the tickets directly from the airline. Their way to solve problems is simply inefficient.
4	I was contacted by Skypicker on 29th Jan, less than 20 hours before travelling, Kristina told me that our fight from Saigon to Nha Trang was reschedule from 16:55 to 06:55 on 30th, and there was no alternative flight form Jetstar airline on the same day. The problems are, we will arrive at Sigon at 13:00 from Kuala Lumpur and we have booked non refundable hotel in Nha Trang. If we couldn't reach Nha Trang on 30th, it means we will waste one night pre paid accommodation of two rooms in Nha Trang, roughly £300 plus the potential cost for the hotel in Saigon if we have to change the flight to 31st. I was quite nervous when I heard the bad news. After I explained the our travel plan to Kristina and told her that we really need to reach Nha Trang on 30th. She promise that find the best solution for us. For the last few hours she was keeping me updated by phone calls. Finally, on the fourth call, she arranged a flight for us from another airline, updated us to business class. Although it took me a couple of hours waiting for the news and cost of receiving the calls from abroad. I am very pleased with the outcome and I deeply appreciated her effort. Thank you Kristina.
5	Outstanding service by the consultant.
5	The customer service was excellent, the booking was easy and for something so reasonable I didn't expect it to be!
5	Mr. aamer I thank the wonderful people and the best technical support in the world portion
5	Any time I had question Igor Tarasuik answers me immediately.
5	Thank you Mohammed for helping me the very last moment with my boarding passes !
5	I got very quick and great help from Kiwi on the chat when wanted to change my ticket and buying extra luggage by great assistents from Miroslava P. Thanks!

5	Well the entire process took more than 7 hours but I really appreciate the effort put in by Ms. Zdenka at Skypicker. She is highly professional in approach and also ensured that I get the ticket booked as per the itinerary. My best wishes to her and Skypicker.Skypicker the online booking platform for any ticketing activity is very competitive, please ensure  that you don't keep the applicants waiting for such a long time. It also brings a bad mark on your reputation. Hope you all will work towards improving it.I seriously still didn't understand the concept of paying in IDR if you could explain. Happy flying !!!! Cheers
5	Eleonora N. quickly helped me to delete a duplicate booking and resent me all the relevant travel documents. So helpful!
2	We will provide a further update once this issue has been resolved, we are sorry for any inconvenience to our customers. Skypicker team
5	Great Job by Magda Pěnková who helped me in finding new flight to Prague. I am really would like to thank Magda Penkova who took her best initiative in booking new flight for me although my last flight were canceled due to some problems. Well done SKypicker!!!!!Great customer service fulfill customers requirements ,,,thank you again
4	The eticket no was not provided at the first place, which to me, as a staff of airlines industry for more than 10years, is a very abnormal thing. After emailed the customer services, the problem has been fixed shortly and we have no problem at all in checking in both sectors. Skypickers also kept me informed for every progress about ticket purchase.
5	I accidentally typed in wrong credentials and Viktor on online chat manage to fixed it fast and easy.
1	Booked 2 return seats from Christchurch to Auckland after 10min they said there was a minor technical problem 1hr 10min later they came back to say the price had gone up 187 NZD about £92.00 blaming the carrier for the extra price lost the hotel we were going to book because we were to late so should have booked the flight direct what we were going to do in the first place will not use this company again is this how this company operate or is this a big scam
5	Kiwi Consultant Monika K. helped me to consult some trip changes and advised me some must see London stuff.thanks a lot :)
5	I hadn't received my e-ticket confirmation and I had the LUCK to be attended by mrs Kristina who made the whole process a piece of cake!Thank you Kiwi and most of all, thank you Kristina!
5	Use <http://KIWI.COM|KIWI.COM> first time - I trust the flight will be fine

3	@skypickercom Can you follow me back so I can send?
5	Excellent customer service. Katerina was right onto my request for extra luggage, and settled within the hour. The overall service from booking , to transfers, to price, has exceeded my expectations, and I hope to travel with SkyPicker again, next month. Thank you so much.David Herewini (New Zealander)Living in Perth WA.
5	Pavel Burian and also Ratu Tomasi, Kateryna Shyshkina were exceptional in dealing with my flight issue. They were prompt, efficient and very professional.  my flight amendment got resolved in no time. regardsDanita
5	Fast and profesionnal response. We are very satisfiet.After we made an error in the passenger's name, Eric help us to solve this problem. He called the airline and fixed the problem for free.Thank you so much.Merci beaucoup.Greetings from France
5	Martin Carter was extremely helpful and efficient. I would definitely use Skypicker again.
5	Excellent service!, sorted out all of my questions, thnx soo much! Aura! :) Your the best!
5	I have recently booked two flights with skypicker which were much more cheaper than at concurrence. Everything went well. Highly recommended! Looking forward to use your services again!
4	Thanks Saskia - there was an error with my booking which was dealt with quickly and I was refunded. I had all my questions answered with no fuss.
5	Thank you for your help Daniel, you were very nice and helpful. Fast response and usefull inforations. I will book on <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> again. Thank you!
4	Agent Lukas helped me fast, correctly and friendly. It was nice.
5	Thanks to Jonathan for re-booking my trip!! Stupid me accidently cancelled my flight from Wellington (NZ) to Avarua (Cook Islands) and so I called the help-line immediately. Jonathan was so kind and called me back saying that my flight is booked again. All in all it just took one hour to get everything sortet out :) hope everything will work out properly now and I'm really looking forward to my trip!
1	Do not book with skypicker. They are a joke of a company. They advertise fare's and when the price goes up, they say the fare is not available or blame technical diffuculties. Its a scam.  These should no be allowed to sell anything.
5	Great experience and no doubts about the tickets or anything
5	Vlad was very helpul and friendly! Absolutely amazing service! Thank you!!!
5	Even though it was no longer possible to add or change anything in the reservation on-line, the helpdesk was very helpful and managed to first add passports numbers and then make avaliable adding a registered baggage.The contact was very nice and all went smooth and fast. Highly recommended!
5	We was two friends booking same ticket separately, the one ticket was confirmed but the other one was not confirmed as the flight was fully booked. Normally it would be a mess to get the confirmed ticked refunded but with Kiwi they managed to fix everything and contacted the 3 different airlines regarding this long flight to get theirs refund confirmation. That is what I call a excellent :-)Will give a special thank to travel consultant Bogdan and to rest of the team at <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>
5	<http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> is a competitive travel service.Their online helpline is efficient 24/7.I admire Miroslav for being all the time restlessly active & successfully processing my refund issue.Thank you

4	Hanka, the name of the employee who helped me at customer service was a pro. Quick and efficient I had all my problems solved. Hanka is dope af fam, 10/10 would use again, if Hanka was there.
4	"Reasonable T&C, support (the little I needed) was good and responsive.No option for seat selection (even with airline that provide this option on their web site).I'm only curious how worthy will they be if ""real"" support will be required (e.g. cancellations or dis-satisfaction from airline, etc.) however the potential is there.Due to previous experience I try to avoid agents and book my flight directly with airlines. In this case it was a bargain deal using airline combination that wasn't available for regular online booking so I had to book with via this agent. I didn't regret it and I leave the door open for them for next time I book.Bottom line: it was a bargain deal."
4	Ruslana replies very quickly and tries to sort everything out very fast.thanks,
5	Dear Josef!I would like to say Thank you for helping me. I had a mistake by booking. My name was wrong. I thought, that I must to pay a lot of money for the correcting. Josef helped me, and I did not had to pay. The live chat is fantastic!Thank you!
5	Selorm was really good.
5	found skypicker easy to follow
5	@stephronyt Great roundup here! Know how Skypicker came about? Founder went from college student on a budget to CEO. Makes for a good story!
5	Petra from skypicker rescued my trip! I completely mixed up my online check in and baggage booking. Within 48 hours of my flight I was able to use the online chat function (which is awesome!), and Petra added passenger info to my flights, checked us in, and negotiated a personalized baggage fee. She was so patient with my silly mistakes and incredibly helpful. Thanks!! My mind is much more at ease now.
5	It's my second time with Skypicker - again without problems. Search and booking process gone smoothly and comfortablewithout any issues - I can fully recommend it anyone.
1	We had to either change the departure date, departure location or cancel our booking some 6 days before our flight. First, we tried calling both the UK and Vietnam numbers listed on their website numerous times over a 24hr period and they were both constantly busy. We then sent them an email request, which they responded to after a follow up email. The email said they would contact the airlines and get back to us. The following day, whilst we were waiting to hear back, we found their live chat link and used this to follow up on our request. The contact asked us to change our flight using their online service, which didn't work. Then she said she would get back to us to let us know what options were available to us, again. Her next response was to confirm, via email, we couldn't cancel the flight (some 4/5 days out???) and to let us know that the change of date can only happen with one leg of the journey, and by the way, she'd gone ahead and changed the flight and the new ticket will be sent out to us for the first half of the journey. We would have to buy another ticket for the second half, pay 80 euros for the change of date and not be reimbursed for any of the ticket price that we had previously paid. I then told them that was was not what we requested, we merely wanted options. We instructed them to please keep the original flight. All the time we were still trying to contact them via telephone to no avail. They then apologised for the misunderstanding, looked into our request and offered an alternative which would have cost us $500 plus the cost of our original ticket. This was obviously unacceptable, especially as it was still 3 days before the flight. They blamed the airlines for the lack of flexibility with these change requests. In my experience this has never been the case with any other airline or third party, that my wife and I have ever flown and we have both done extensive travelling. In the end our flight stayed the same and we made other arrangements. Our message to you is BEWARE: if you think there is any chance you will need to change your booking - reconsider using their service. They were hard to contact and not flexible with our requests compared to other 3rd party agents.Edit
5	I wanted to book some seats on a flight I have later on in the year and within 5 minutes I was sorted with my seats and confirmed payment. Just a simple conversation in a chat window with a lovely polite lady called Natalya and I was sorted.Thanks very much Natalya :)
5	I'd like to thank for telephone support of employee - Martin. I needed to correct a mistake in name of passenger and he took care of all necessary formalities in airline. He was helpful and friendly.I'm looking forward to traveling by <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> :)
5	The support and attention it's 5 star, all my question was cleared with the best kindly answer. Hope travel with this company more time.A big thank you to the David.
5	I always book my flights in <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com>. Good prices, great flight combinations, and personalized customer service. In my last booking, I introduced my data wrongly and Mr. Edoardo P helped me very quick and in very professionally way.In my opinion, from kiwi´s side, I would send the boarding passes a bit earlier than 1 day before the flight.
4	V.good customer service, Alan was v helpful and quick when resolving my mistake!
5	Thanks Rodon for helping me with my mistake on the online chat, awesome! I might wrote the wrong e-mail as you said, but I think it is a bit weird since I had a very clear mind that day. Im suspicious since you are investigated for fraud.
5	everithing fine with my booking...they send my ticket in my e-mail quicklyso everything was exellent...very good price and very easy reservation...i travel in italy from greece athens in romeand i get back in athens from milan...thank you for everything...i recomend 10/10 from me...
5	Skypicker is awesome!! They are really friendly and gave solve all problems quickly.
5	I was helped today by Eric, he was very helpful I left the conversation understanding exactly what i need to do for travelling tomorrow.  I have experienced good customer service the staff at kiwi are incredibly polite and understanding.
5	I had a problem with my credit card when trying to book tickets on Skypicker and got in contact with Martin Carter from costumer service through the company's website chat and he was so nice and helpful and really cared about trying to guide me through sorting out whatever issue I was having. I would like to congratulate Skypicker on their solving-problems system.
5	Thank you Owen and <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> for being so supportive. I had to book very last minute flights for a friend travelling from Melbourne, AUS to Kona, HI where his daughter had recently passed away. Owen helped so much and had lots of great ideas about how we could make the travel as easy as possible for my friend. Unfortunately, my friend missed his connecting flight to Hawaii in Auckland - the two hour gap between flights just was not enough time given my friend's mental/emotional state and his physical condition. Overall, a tricky situation and it was very difficult to get the best flights last minute and for a reasonable price. Owen made this as pain free as it could be, which we greatly appreciated.
5	I mistakly put a wrong email on the resarvation and I didnt get the confirmation because of that. So I used the chat on the company websitr and get a quiek and helpfull answer! Thank you very much for the exellent service
2	A startup that finds discount flight tickets 'hidden' on airline websites just ... - Business Insider <https://t.co/aLQfrbWw1O>
5	Booked a flight for mum mother who is disabled. I called Kiwi and requested special wheelchair assistance for her 2 flights. Lorena and Vicky from customer services were both very helpful and polite and managed to call both airlines and arrange help. Mum arrived in the UK safely and we are all very grateful for their support.
5	I had no idea that i was late to check in online .. and a great girl name Maria helped me alot, the thing is that I made another mistake by given a wrong pass # but i foung a great help from another lady called Denis K. and within seconds she understood my problem and didnt hasitate to help and answer all my needs. so thank you lovely girls. as well as i never used this web befor and im about to start a short trip, Im sure that in case of need to use the service again I will be replyed with the best service.greetings from IsraelAtalia.
2	I was skeptical about buying tickets through a 3rd party, but it seemed like a fast an efficient way to handle multiple travel arrangements. I will not make this mistake again. My e-Ticket from SkyPicker mentioned 2 pieces of hand (carry-on) luggage included on a Spirit airlines flight, but that was in error. I almost paid $110 because I would have purchased baggage at the gate for a premium. Luckily, Spirit took pity on me. Pros: very reasonably priced airfare options, but add-ons (like checked luggage) are more expensive than booking directly with the airlines (which you can't really do since a 3rd party is making arrangements for you). They are fairly responsive to inquiries and their customer service reps were all friendly and professional. They handle check-ins for you and forward you boarding passes which I thought was helpful. Cons: they handle all your bookings. So, if you want to add a checked bag, you pay a hefty amount to do it through them or go around them to book it directly with the airline, which is irritating. They made a mistake that almost cost me $110 at the airport gate with my carry-on luggage. It was incredibly frustrating and made my time at the airport more stressful than it already was.
5	The chat feature was very easy  and fast and Dominika was very polite and helpful
3	I have just purchased flights with Kiwi. com. I required assistance with my purchase and was helped by Radek in customer chat. So far so good, Radek answers my quires promptly and offered further insight. If my booking comes in OK, my experience with Kiwi. com has been good!
5	I put in a wrong passport number in my booking. It make a lot of trouble but Eric helped me to change to correct information. He called me several times and make a very good service.Jan
5	This review is mostly just about the incredible help I received from a employee named Katerina. She went out of her way to help me with things that were both flight related and non flight related and was very empathetic towards my situations. A truly wonderful human being, thank you again Katerina.
1	"This is a scam company.Here is how it works:1. They sell you cheap flights. 2. Then they cancel one of your flights around 24h before departure. This makes it impossible to get a decent flight as substitute.3. As a remedy they ""offer"" an alternative.4. The alternative usually implies horrendous flight times (early start and/or late arrival) paired with incredibly long travel durations (e.g. a flight from Germany to Mallorca is offered with 12+ hours duration). An additional charge (around 50 Euro) is also neccesary.5. If they offer a refund it will not be for the complete trip, but only for the flight that was cancelled. They do not care that you are not able to get to your destitnation, that you have a hotel booking, a car rental, etc.6. Get fake 5 star reviews. Just look closer at the 5 stars generic and overly satisfied text and peoples profiles and you will quickly look behind that scheme.AVOID this company."
5	Good service and helpful specially that employee at chat she was nicely ( she's name is Irina)
4	The customer service representative, Puput, really helped to correct reservation information and successfully get the boarding passes through the system.
5	Everything pretty simple when booking and everything explained well.Wil definantly use it again!
5	After calling a couple of times, Lydie help me with all my questions.
1	People, be aware of kiwi!! We just missed flight because their website mislead us about visas requirements!! While booking there no way to understand if you need additional visa for your flight. Just lost $1500, time. Very disappointing with kiwi's customer service! Be aware!
5	Lovely Customer Care by Radek!Was extremely helpful.
5	Very helpful people , they help you choose your flight and even if it is booked with 2 different airlines 1 stop flight , they will guarantee replacing the ticket if you lose the second flight , and they help you change your seat , make notes about your meal change preferences .
5	Huge thanks to Bek who I just spoke with via chat. Super helpful, as always. I've used this chat feature several times, as it can be very intimidating purchasing airline tickets that are non-refundable, and I've always left the conversation feeling assured and confident that I've made a good choice. Currently Bek is helping me to see if I can transfer my purchase as I found a direct flight for the same price. Fingers crossed! Regardless of the outcome, I am glad that I chose to book through SkyPicker.
5	I was using the Kiwi chat and talked to this agent named Anna. She was professional and very helpful. It was my lucky day to have Anna helping me with the issues relating to my flight. She answered my questions promptly and was not hesitant to offer advice and guidance. Excellent agent!
5	I called in regarding a change in passenger details. Mohammed was very helpful and resolved my request quickly. I am very impressed by the high standard and efficiency of the Kiwi customer service. Keep up the good works!
5	Skypicker saved our international trip. Our first flight was delayed and caused us to miss our international flight. The airline we used was completely unsympathetic and told us we needed to buy an entirely new ticket for a flight that wouldn't leave for 2 more days. I was on the phone with Skypicker and they offered an alternative solution that saved us a huge amount of stress. I was so thankful for Selorm who was very attentive - and kept calling to encourage me they were working on a solution. Skypicker came through with a completely new itinerary and covered the cost of it all, plus a night we had to stay in a hotel. Vladimir was the one who helped us with our final itinerary. It sounds cheesy but we felt so alone in those moments, and no one else was available or willing to help us figure out what we needed to do. Instead of a ruined vacation, now we just have a more adventurous story to tell.
4	I was a little late with some informations for check-in, but I called skypicker and I got some great service by Neil. Made my day :)
5	Jan was really excellent in answering to my doubt.Good service while booking and excellent service while chatting for help
5	I spoke with agent Stan and he was very kind and helpful and was able to answer all my questions easily. He also worked with me to ensure my conerns were handled properly.
3	"1. Info received in the email concerning my journey (4 flights in total) was missing important pieces which complicated my life in the transit airpot between first and second flight and incressed the costs of the journey. In order to get the full picture one has to check the email received from <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> AND the online booking manager. The info in the email are totally misleading even if it's clearly written ""boarding passes will be sent on [...]"".2. Excellent customer support (Tatev Grigorian): offered me support to avoid increassing the total costs even more."
5	I was grateful to have Lukas help me with questions I had about my flights booked through kiwi. He was very reassuring, friendly and easy to talk to and made sure I had all the information I needed. Thanks Lukas!
1	I made a reservation in the website of Skypicker.The airline was Vietjet Air.A week ago, I checked my reservation in the website of Vietjet Air.Then I found that Skypicker booked wrong airplane. The departure time was different between from Skypicker and from VietJet Air.I want to leave at 9:45 from Danang to Ho chi Mihn,but Skypicker booked to leave at 8:30 to Ho Chi Mihn.Rightafter I found this problem, I wrote a letter to Skypicker.They didn't give me a answer.I was so upset, because If I didn't ckecked in VietJet Air, I can miss the airplane to Hochimin. It give me a terrible experience about my travel.I hope Skypicker give me any reactions about my problem. Because I will begin my travel in 1 week. After they can give me a refund, I can revise my schedule and make a reservation for proper airplane, again.They did't give me a obvious answer and just waste my time. I'm afraid to seek a new plane ticket. I hope Skypicker to give me a refund ASAP.
5	Needed help to change some of the data we introduce wrong. I was served by Anastasiia k., who understood my problem and immediately volunteered the fix. Everything happened too fast, thus remedied my oversight. Thank you!
4	Eric helped us through changing our passport numbers before an international flight with no worries. I wish I could have taken care of it online myself, but this was the next best thing. Thanks Eric.
5	I was helped by Kristyna and Radim today for a very important flight. I am indebted to their service and care.
5	What was starting to look like a traveling disaster, was turned into a minor hiccup by the operators and rescue team of <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> (first flight was severely delayed). Owen really helped me out, and when I book my next trip to the Czech Republic (Recommendation by Owen) i'm definitely using Kiwi.
1	"I accidentally purchased the wrong return flight and contacted the site to cancel the flight within the legally protected refund time frame. They did not respond until the next day and refused to adhere to EU and US transportation policies which require a refund within a certain amount of time. Repeated attempts to contact them resulted in being disconnected on live chat, bounced to different reps, and receiving numerous generic email responses. They continually refer on their ""no refund policy"" but their Terms and Conditions have numerous contradictory sections on the EU cancellation legislature. The terms are gibberish and designed to confuse customers. I eventually got someone on the phone who admitted that I could have been refunded within the first day but then tried to tell me that I did not contact them soon enough to act on this, which was a lie. He assured me he was going to ""investigate"" my case and took my number, saying he would call back within the weekend. I received a generic email from another rep on Monday, once again referencing their convoluted terms and conditions. When I have asked for transcripts of conversations from live chat the rep initially tried to refuse, and when I  sent them screenshots of my issues and a document of the legislature detailing how their policy is illegal several of their agents claimed it does not apply to them or that they cannot open the attachment. This company offers abysmal customer service, with no accountability on behalf of their agents or managers. Further more their policies are illegal. I am currently disputing the charge with my bank now. You have been warned."
5	I was beginning to think that I am in trouble due to some date confusions but with the help of Emanuela W. and Varvara S. things turned excellent pretty quick. Well done!
5	Denis helped me to resolve the query quickly. I really appreciate his work.
5	Shout out to my man Lukas P, he has been a great help to me and my friend, good and fast.
5	I had great experience with Kiwi. Especially support fron Marketa G. was super nice. It was direct, quick and with can-do attitude.  Though I have to say personally I feel little bit limited with the rule that I have to do check in 72 hours before departure. I usually do check in no more then 24 hours before.  Best regardsTomas
5	I had a problem with the flight tickets since I had two flights in the same day, but the confirmation mail states that one of the tickets was going to be sent to me the same day of the trip (very inconvenient for me).I contact through chat with Adam Jelínek and he solved instantaneously (I received the mail with both tickets while i was still chating to him).Amazing job Adam! Thanks a bunch!!!
5	Bought 4 non-connected flights, the service was amazing (thank you, Eleonora N ;).Ryanair check-in made easy and at the earliest possible, all documents and flight info duplicated in all emails – great convenience. And as a cherry on the milkshake – got my favourite window seats in the back!.. Might've been random, though. Still a great service! :)
5	The internet gave a error on the page while I was paying my flight. So I booked again. I got a mail that I booked a double flight. I was in stress. But Tomas U. helped me very friendly and quickly. I am very happy that he had cancelled my second flight.

5	Could not find how to input passenger details into my flight booking. Came to find it was just a website error. Spoke to an agent named Barbara on live chat who sorted the problem straight away and with first class customer service. The original booking process was easy and I'm sure I will use Kiwi again in the future.
5	I was helped both with speed and excellent service.Im very happy with the response and the great attitude of the supportteam.Alex A, especially.
5	A very big thank you to Archi! He tell me what to do and give me à great help! Five stars, really:)

5	"I have made a booking via SkyPicker for 2 leg flight with... some low cost airlines. Some problems occured but NOT the fault of SkyPicker, rather with airlines. So on 2 occasions I have contacted SkyPicker customer support and got an excellent experience. One with agent Alan and this one now with agent Calrisse via Live chat. Both agents were very helpful, polite and professional!. And I love the ""Live chat"" to avoid any phone charges."

5	I'm extremely happy to finally have a service which also looks for low-cost flights combinations. And there are so many filters I was hoping for, which really help me to find the best option I need.
3	Skypicker offers flights for up to 90 percent less with a cloud-based ticketing portal: In 2012, Skypicke... <https://t.co/xzByZRnGcx> #IBM
1	We have had a terrible experience with Skypicker--I would never use them again and would warn anyone against using them.  We had a flight booked from Varanasi through Delhi to Udaipur India.  Skypicker emailed us to say the second leg of our trip had been cancelled and they had rebooked us on a flight 4 hours later, leaving us with an entire day waiting around the Delhi airport and getting us into Udaipur too late in the night.  As anyone on vacation can appreciate, your time is precious and you make your travel plans carefully.  We called to see if we could be rebooked on an itinerary closer to our original itinerary (which they offered), a refund or credit so we could rebook ourselves.  After talking to more than 4 extremely unhelpful and borderline rude customer service folks they told us the booking department had denied our request DESPITE the terms on their website clearly stating that if your flight is changed and your itinerary negatively effected they would refund or rebook you at your discretion.  I have never had a worse experience with a travel provider.  What a horrible way to treat your customers.
5	I love Skypicker for the possibility to find flights selecting the radius and the range of dates, so if you are free to fly where and when you want, you can be sure to find the best fares ever.By the way, this was the first time that I used the Skypicker services to book the flights straight through them. The booking process of the connections flights was extremely smooth and easy, and it wouldn't have been the same if I booked straight away with the Air Company.When I needed to add an infant to all of the four flights already purchased, the support team was great and they sorted everything out in few hours with my peace of mind, A particular THANK YOU goes to Bashana K, who was very kind and helpful despite of the late time.I would recommend Skypicker to anyone! Well done Skypicker!
3	Also PLEASE check your PM, i have sent a copy of the Booking Reservation with the Flight number clearly stated above.
1	This agent took my money for a flight booking and promised me to refund it if I decided not fly and when I did give them a notice that I will be delaying my flight it took them 3 months to refund my money and when they did they only gave me $40 back out of $900 while they promised full refund !!!!!!
5	Awsome service specially when someone like Jan answers all the questions and is ahead of the game, thanks alot was awesome, swift and effective experience .
5	I found out the wrong information and thank you for solving it quickly.Verry good and i am happy. Thanks for your cooperation.
4	very quick, easy and helpful service over the chat function by a nice employee Neil
5	If you want to find the best offers this website is definitely the best option. Good prices, good customer service, you quickly get your ticket and you can go to the airport.
5	I am very, very pleased with the customer service provided by Saskia, and the overall support by Kiwi. Booking with this website is so much easy, its all that you would prefer from a travel website. I will continue to book my travels with Kiwi. HIGHLY RECOMMEND.
5	Filip M. was very helpful with my travel mixups and some changes I needed to make. Very excited to have discovered the customer service and reasonable flight prices from Kiwi!
1	If I could give this website a negative 5 I would.We used skypicker for the first time and will DEFINITELY be the last. To cut a long painful ordeal short. We ended up missing our flight after a 5.5 hour delay and a unannounced gate change at 3:30am. The airline agreed with us and said that they would fully refund our ticket because they had a policy that any flight delayed over 3 hours the flight could be refunded or modified. The airline told us all we needed was skypicker's registered email and phone number. So we contacted Skypicker and Initially the agents totally confirmed that yes we could get a refund and/or modify the flight.....well that story soon changed to well we are so sorry WE CAN NOT!!. For the next 4 hours we received the complete run around from this company. Agents were rude and would often disconnect us from the chat. So at the end of the day they left my family and I stranded. Please do a search on the internet ( or just scroll down on this page) for others who have reviewed this company - these negative reviews are all VERY true. Use at your own peril.
5	Thanks Aura ,for helping me to correct the name on the ticket. you did a great job and fast !!!
4	When calling the service department regarding my booking I got so much help and a great service, so I am really happy with Skypicker so far. My flight is tomorrow so hope everything goes well. Thank you so much from the service minded women, Kira! :)
3	You are a joke. You will be bankrupt in a month or 2
5	My original journey was DEL-MAA-KUL-OOL as the cheapest flights found through Skypicker. Unfortunately, between DEL-MAA, the domestic carrier in India was roughly 2 hours delayed, which then prevented me from boarding the connecting flight in MAA, and I was effectively stranded! Thankfully, the Skypicker team guaranteed return flights as policy, so I was provided with a flight from MAA-KUL the next day, a hotel provided in KUL for the overnight stay, then another flight for KUL-OOL. Though this meant I got home 2 days late, the help and kindness from the Skypicker team was so appreciated at this stressful time, and it really helped to defuse the situation. Thankyou so much Skypicker!! Will be using your services again!
5	"This is the fourth time I am using <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>, and they are often the cheapest to book through, and if not, I usually pay the little extra, to book through them. Just in case, i need any support, this booking company has 8+ scores on trustpilot and good reviews, so it seems to be much better security than any of my other choices who is around 4-6 and a lot of bad reviews.This time, I needed their help though. I got a message, saying that my flight has been rescheduled(A short domestic flight). This was an issue, as I had already booked non-refundable hotels, and the new flight time would be the day after the original plan.I went online, and chatted with live-support(In the middle of the night - With Emre Tam), where I told them about my issue of the rescheduled flight. They were fully understanding right away, and said that they would look into it, and promised me that they would turn back to me with a solution within 24 hours. Just 6 hours later, they(Pavel Burian - Costumer service) had managed to find a local airline, which had the same route at 12:15 pm(Instead of 12 pm) - So only 15 minutes later than the original plan!! And asked me for to confirm this choice within 12 hours, which i did, and got a new e-ticket sent to me. Super smooth.So far, it seems like I am not paying anything different or extra, even though they had to book through another airline in order to meet my needs.Only thing, which could be different, was that the text I got, did not say which plane had been rescheduled, but just that ""Your plane"" had been rescheduled(And I had 4 booked at the time).However, costumer service were also able to assist with this, so still:5/5 - Superb with everything so far."
5	I did by accident type in some wrong information in my booking, skypickers costumer service was fast and efficient !! lovely to experience a customer service that takes it seriously and have personality aswellThank you for fixing my problem Eleonora C from <http://skypicker.com|skypicker.com>xx from a happy traveller!
5	"I would like to say ""thanks"" to Martin from support team for quick and detailed response to my request."
3	Checked these against other price comparison sites and for Low Cost Carriers they charged £20 more for the same flights booked directly and you also have the hassle of Advanced Passenger Information - my details are held by Ryanair and EasyJet so I don't need to keep re-entering them. I'm not sure whether you pay extra for luggage as well because didn't get that far!
5	SkyPicker  is simply the best when it comes to on-line flight bookings.  Try them, you will be pleasantly surprised at the savings - E-Tickets are sent to your inbox within an hour of booking. Forgot to add an extra in your original booking ??  its not a prob as their  24/7 service line can take care of everything in no time.  But wait....there's more... look at this:Skypicker GuaranteeWe have you covered if you miss your connecting flight due to cancellation, delay, or rescheduling of any of the flights you booked with us during your journey. If such a situation occurs, we will either buy you a seat on the next available flight to your destination free of charge or issue a full refund of your booking.Go for it Folks - -- We Did
5	The agent I just spoke with, Daniel, was super helpful, informative, and speedy response! :-)
5	Jan Lukasek was a fantastic help easing any worries I had about my flights , 10/10. Explained everything very well, was patient in explaining the whole process, etc.
5	I accidentally booked flights for a wrong day and i called to ask if i could change the date of the flights. Kiwi changed it for a fee of 22e. I also had a problem with giving my passport info on the website and i received good help from the chat from Valentin.
5	i lost my e-ticket, and lydie helped me find it patiently, thanks a lot!
5	I made a mistake in my booking with the date. With the chat function Kiwi gave me very good help and service. And you can contact them 24/7. Prices are really good. Highly recommended.
5	There was a problem with my expiration date on the document, I contacted live support and agent Enri. A was very helpful and fast in his response and the communication was clear. Thanks.
4	I got connected with David and Daniel and both helped me out to sort out my situation. Although I'm still waiting for the final answer they gave a high class assitance
5	Thanks to Lenka who helped out with some questions that I had before booking.
5	I was hesitant at first to use this company because I hadn't heard of them before. Very glad I choose to, the website offered many flight options with better prices than I found elsewhere.  We completed our travel without issue and everything went as planned through Kiwi. I will definitely be using them again.
2	regardless of how I book my flights, I'm used to check in for my flights. I recently made a booking with Skypicker (Kiwi) and not only I cannot do my own check in, I cannot even retrieve my booking on the Ryanair site. I called and was told Kiwi does not allow me to do this, and that if I contacted Ryanair directly, they would charge me for checking me in, which is not true. their agents will argue with you and laugh at you over the phone. stay away from these dodgy agency. the vast number of positive reviews make me think they must encourage their agents to fill in positive reviews to deceive prospective customer. AVOID AT ALL COSTS
3	@skypickercom hi ive contacted u guys this morning but some website was malfunctioned so couldnt view the options my order no. Is 326103
1	J ais pris un billet a 5jours de mon depart,j ais reçus le n de reservation mais a 3jours de mon depart tjrs pas de confirmation...ça me stress comme pas possible car je ne sais pas quoi faire...attendre ou prendre un autre billet...tres tres mauvaise experience.
5	I was referred to a flight deal with Kiwi by searching through <http://Momondo.com|Momondo.com>. Knowing nothing about the company, I was hesitant to book the flight, but the deal was so good I had to take the risk. I was very pleased that I did. My flight was in two parts, the first from Nashville to Las Vegas on Frontier Airlines, the second from LAS to San Francisco on JetBlue. What I particularly liked about Kiwi was the email I received the day before my first flight, providing a link to check in. I did not have to hunt around for the right website to check in, it was all set up for me. One less thing to hassle with before traveling is a great service in my experience. Everything else worked without a hitch, too, which was especially helpful during the busy Thanksgiving holiday travel time. Thank you, Kiwi!
5	SkyPicker is the best option available in the market. The web page makes it really easy to know what days have the best prices to flight to the destination wanted. As well as the specifications with luggage, food, etc.I will add that will be amazing if there will be a possibility of doing the pre-check, that well its easier to find better sits. As well that in all planes appeared that food wasn't included and in my flight from SJO to FLL the drinks and snacks were included.But overall and incredible experience and I wouldn't doubt to use SkyPicker in the near future.As we say in Costa Rica, Pura Vida!
5	Never used this site before. I was a bit hesitant to book via kiwi but after seeing the reviews I went ahead and booked. Reviews were not wrong afterall. Thank you KIWI.
5	They help me to pass online check-in even when I was drunk! No problems, best website!
5	I had to book multi destination flights and I was not fully confident , so tried to call sky-picker customer care service . It was amazing welcoming pleasant  and friendly way of solving my booking issues , I am not sure if I wrote her name  properly she was Horiyat . I really liked the way some one was in a state to answer my queries without any hesitation , this my first time with sky picker but with this kind of service will always look forward to book in near future . I will say  to all experience the hospitality .
5	Thank you Eva S!  After missing my transatlantic flight due to a delay in my connection flight, I called the Kiwi help desk. Within a minute of dialing, Eva was already on the line assisting me - this is extremely helpful after having just missed an international flight! After I explained to her my situation, she put in a service order to be reviewed.  Within 20 minutes, she called back to tell me that I had received a full refund and was able to help me schedule a flight for the next day.  Thanks for helping me make the best of a stressful situation!
1	"They took my moene, twice, and I didnt receive any tickets. First time thay told me they got technical issue( they sent email in two hours) for the second time guy on chat told me thay just don't have tickets and if  i want I can buy it for more than 1200 EUR instead 126USD for the first time, I was waiting for anwer from them for few hours and that send my moeny back for the second time, no I don't have ticket and I don't have my money coz its stuck for ""10 business days"" in CC. aaaaand I don't have moeny to buy tickets. This company really bad."
5	Quick and very helpful Live Chat support, sorted my passport information out with the airline in matter of minutes! Looking forward to using SkyPicker in the future.
1	Hello,I booked a flight from Santiago to Frankfurt with <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> and I had some serious problems with my flight, I've attached the tickets so you can check what happened, the first flight with Gol had a delay of almost 2 hours and I couldn't take my connection flight with Latam, after explaining what happened they gave me a letter which I had to give to Latam so I can have a new flight, this was for the next day, so I had to spend 24 hours in Sao Paulo, and Gol didn't want to pay for anything (like acommodation or food) because they said I had a connection with a different airline and according to them it wasn't their obligation because 2 hours is not enough delay, so I had to book a hotel close to the airport (late at night) and I payed all that from my pocket.  I didn't have wifi because there's no open/free wifi in Sao Paulo's airport (and they didn't have roaming so I couldn't communicate with my family and friends), and also I didn't have reales because I wasn't expecting to stay there, so it was really uncomfortable for me, because travelling alone at night in Sao Paulo is not safe at all. I'm expecting full compensation for all the extra costs as well as a refund for my flight as I didn't get what I paid for. I've attached all the required information from my flight and you can check with the airline about the times (they changed the gate and the time of the flight). They didn't want to give a refund and when they finally accepted to I never heard back from them.
5	I am using Kiwi second time. I like it first of all because of ease of use. The  website is easy to use and really flexible. Second is because the prices are always low. And the third, because all run smooth and well.
5	Great customer service from Tomas Muzik
1	Avoid this site.
5	No problems. Great customer service.
5	Lenka resolved my issue in less than 2 minutes and was very helpful.Will recommend Kiwi to others.
5	I Got the help I needed from Puput. Very useful and kind
5	Yesterday I booked tickets on <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> and filled up the wrong date of fligt. I had an online conversation with travel consultant Jan S. He helped me and quickly solved my problem. His help was extremely important so i apreciate that. Thanks a lot Jan!!!
5	I am very satisfied with <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com>.First of all, they helped me get the best solution for my flight.Second, when I needed assistance, I spoke with David who was very attentive.Great services and highly recommend this site.
5	I had some problems with my e-ticket and Eric solved them.  Told and explained everything! Thank u for your help !!!
5	Apparently the boarding cards were not received earlier. After contacting the online support this matter was solved in a few minutes. Thank you for the successful support!
5	This is the best assistance I have ever received. Jan calm me down, was very patient and attentive, he/she did more than expected to make sure I was able to get all my information correctly. Overall Jan support is magnificent and I am happy I did my booking with this company since I can truly feel Helpdesk really care about their clients.
5	"The service is absolutely stellar. I got what I needed for a fantastic price and a guarantee i didnt even expect. Had to make some changes to the booking out of their actual ""legal"" period but still had the impeccable support to do it for me."
4	Hi!I booked via skypicker for my first time in my life. I did not have enough money to travel from Bucharest to Bergen (Norway), but with skypicker I did it. It cost me 150-160euro. I knew is gonna be a long day becouse of the costs. So, my travel was composed from 3 flights. All in the same day. Bucharest-Milano, Milano-Kopenhagen. Kopenhagen-Bergen. All flights was in time and I sucseed to catch all. Overall I am happy becouse of the price! If someone tells me this, I'll never believed! Thank you Skypicker! P.s. I also used the online chat with one of the agents of Skypicker for some misunderstanding issues I had after I left my home. Everything is possible with a smart phone and a internet connection!!
4	@Starrvinnius Of course! :) Please find the button for live chat in the lower left corner. <https://t.co/PD6QF6R1yP>

5	I was very impressed with Skypicker - updates  were every 8 - 10 hours - booking & paying was a doddle...  boarding passes easy peasy! I will definitely be using then every time I fly away... Thank you. Angela
5	The website and app are really easy to use, seamless booking process. I did have a problem with an incorrect title on the booking (my error), but had a live chat via the website with Lorena who sorted it all straight away, she was extremely helpful and efficient. Thank you Lorena.
4	@SkyPickerCOM I have received a call from this number: +380947113191 and i read on internet that is a number support of skypicker. Its true?
3	"BUYER BEWARE ....                                                                        "",,,but as we at Skypicker know that baggage allowance is different with these two airlines we do not mention Extra Hand luggage, because it may cause a problem as for example you have experienced…."""
5	I used the help online to have some info and Tomas was extra helpful.
5	Flight Booking without worry.
5	I bought the wrong flight and I was freaking out, before I reached for the customer's service chat. Soon I was connected to the agent who was Lukas P and he very quickly helped me with my situation. I was worried I will have to book another flight, but thanks to Lukas P I got my money saved.

5	I had a problem with my booking - which was my own fault. I Got a fast reply from their online chat support. Dominika was my supporter and i was helped without a charge and in a very pleasent and helpfull way. Was very impressed and i felt really good afterwards.
5	Thank you for your quality of service. The online chat is very useful as well and Ulug'bek Z. who helped me was very helpful!
5	Really good. They did my check in and put me and my friend in good place. When I needed help I called them and they were helpful
4	it's really nice to talk to the friendly staff and especially to the listening
5	Excelente servicio por Seth Alex al ayudarme a resolver mis dudas, facilitandome una respuesta y solucion rapida de forma eficiente! :)
1	Avoid this company. I booked  5 days ago & they will not provide PNR number. Time to contact Mastercard
5	Thanks to Concosta (hope I've spelt your name correctly!) for checking out my boarding pass worries and leaving me stress free to travel tomorrow!
5	"I have been travelling the Far East for the past 21 months. As any traveller knows: plans change. I have learned not to expect much of anything from ""help"" or ""support"" ""options"". But by chance, I booked a ticket through SkyPicker, and then made a BIG, STUPID typo filling out the online form. Nevertheless, EVERYBODY at Skypicker support was helpful, friendly, and  top-tier courteous in getting the problem solved: there were four steps forward, with no back-steps. One of my Skypicker helpmates even warned that the airline may charge me for the change, but that never came to be. To paraphrase the great ending line from the movie Casablanca: ""Skypicker, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship""."
5	The service gave by <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> is excellent, very easy and fast. We had to buy a flight with less than 72 hours and firstly it was a problem because to ensure your correct check-in their system don't allow to fill you passport numbers in less than 72 hours, however with their chat on line service to help the customer we could talk with Hana, a very helpful and kind agent who could help us in a very efficient way. We also want to remark that <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> offers you a service in your lenguaje and the translation is perfect, at least the translation to Spanish. We recommend <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> very much and if you have to ask for help you will be lucky if Hana is who attend you
5	Excellent customer service by chat. Tatiana O. was very professional and quick at responding and fixed my problem immediately. Good experience.
3	Dear Sir/Madam, we still haven´t been reimbursed flight reservation with reference 198153 when we were promised by Nok Air (Thailand) you will do it in 45 days. It´s been almost 90 days and haven´t received the money back. I was forced to pay again to the airline in cash due to the card holder was a different person than the traveller. Please reimburse the money ASAP. Kind Regards.
1	Complete fraud, shady website with vague language to instill confidence with your purchase. I searched for a flight in March, and results recommended a flight in May, I made the mistake of booking, and shortly after realized the mistake, I attempted to change the flight and was charged more than $50 more than a similar flight on ORBITS, I figured it'd be fine to pay $50 extra for the mistake. I then reached out to make sure I wasn't charged for the first flight only to be told that they offer no refunds and the flight change was basically just buying another ticket and voiding the old one, while paying for both. I will be disputing the charge with my credit card company.
5	David was excellent and helpful and good at communication and making me feel listened to
5	after 4 hours i havent received my flight confirmation and krystina solved it in 5 minutes by the chat (some Passport details were needed to confirm it)
4	Just got off the phone after having a nice chat with Babak. I am pleased with Skypicker's customer service, which is not something you can say about any agency.
5	the best assistans help i had experience in my life.
5	Great, great customer support :)
5	I like Lukas, he was very helpful. Would recommend!
5	I recently spoke to two advisors (Bogdan and Aliz) who went above and beyond to help me sort out an issue (which was my fault anyway!). Both advisors provided excellent service and gave some superb customer service which seems rare these days. Thank you so much to you both. I will forever use you again!!Well done Kiwi!
1	"We were informed that our flights via Brussels airport had been cancelled at 10 pm the evening before our departure, which was quite understandable given the circumstances (6 days after the bomb attack). I contacted the Skypicker support hoping to be offered alternative options on how to get home, as they promise in their ""Skypicker guarantee"". Their response was that they would look into it and get back to me shortly. After not hearing from them for an hour and a half (that was at midnight), I called them again and was told that the operator would visit their booking department personally, speed up the process and have them call me within half an hour. After another hour and a half (1:30 am) I called them again and was told that the operator (another one than the ones before) would visit the booking department located next door and would call me immediately. At 1:45 am I wanted to give up and called them that I would book my alternative transportation by myself. At that point they told me that they found an alternative connection leaving at 9:00 am and that they would verify it and call me back shortly. At 3 am (6 hours before the flight; 3 hours before we needed to leave the hotel in order to catch the flight) I called them (pretty angry at that point) and found out that the only thing they did was that they asked Brussels airlines whether they would refund the payment for the original tickets (even though the airline had stated on their website that they would) and waited for their reply! They would not have booked the alternative flight for us until they got their reply! Why kind of guarantee and customer support is that? What if the Brussels airlines responded after the time we needed to leave the hotel to be able to catch the flight we did not have tickets booked for?I ended up booking alternative flight and then bus + train + bus to get home by myself and got one hour of sleep before leaving our hotel. I could have done the same at 10 pm and could have rested for the long trip that was ahead of us. If you ever book with them, definitely do not rely on their help and book your alternative transportation by yourselves. You will save yourselves some nerves and at least will get some sleep instead of waiting for their call that will never come.Apart from that I do not believe there is any reason to book the tickets through them, as I booked my alternative flight with Ryanair 5 hours before departure, did my on-line check-in and I got two seats next to one another automatically without having to pay any fee for choosing the seats. Not on one of the two flights we booked with them for our way there we got seats next to one another, even though I've booked the tickets approximately 2 weeks in advance. Apparently they do the online check in for each ticket separately even though you book two (or more) seats at once."
3	"The process was very quick, but I ended up paying everything "" I saved "" at the airports with luggage and everything. On the other hand Tom at the online chat was very efficient and helpful, he solved my problem right away! :)"
5	I found this website accidentally yesterday and immediately bought flight ticket which saved me 25% of cheapest fare elswhere. Once they have multi city search available, this will be the top flight ticket search engine for budget travelers and backpackers. Chat is superfast and staff is friendly and helpful (at least David who I talked with was :)). Two thumbs up.

4	Thanks for solving out the problem. Especially for Pedro.
5	Found the lowest prices on flights. Included low-cost airlines with options of stopover. Extremely flexible search engine. Great service doing the check-inn for you. Highly recommendable! Wow!
4	I discovered a mistake in my booking, so I called the airline and they told me there was a change. Then I contacted Kiwi, and Filip helped me out. He revised everything and cleared up the confusión. Then he sent me a new e-Ticket. Now everything is clear. THANKS filip !
5	I had some doubts and I got really fast reply. Many thanks to Lucie O'Bryan for her help and for dedication on my problem. It was my first time booking through <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> and until now was really good.
5	Booked all my tickets with kiwi during my travels, great website and service. I wanted to upgrade my lugage so i can bring all my presents and souvenirs home, got a quick response by Leo (great sense of humor), much appreiciated! Many many Thanks to you all and wish you a very lovely christmas :)Greetings,Sari
1	Overcharge everything for not adding any value.Can't believe I got trapped into this kind of scam
5	Excellent costumer care, fast problem solving Highly recommended! Thanks for all the support at that time the airline cancelled two flights which it made our family miss our connections to our holiday destination. Thanks to Kiwi to fast response re-booking new flights and refunding our forced stay in a hotel. Will absolutely keep traveling with your services!
5	My son was travelling to Europe and missed his connection.  Katrin at Kiwi was very helpful, followed up diligently and assisted with booking him on another flight the next day.  Great service!
1	Let's review together:1. You only mentioned the 1% but you didn't mention about failure in your mobile apps that showed the price that we pay, it's in IDR and after paying u are charging in Euro, so let's be fair in this case, we also don't appreciate the fraudulent due to your technical errors2. About 1% it's the failure of your payment getaway because most of credit card will not allow over limit by 2x,3x,4x even 10x their credit limit so by charging 1% then the bank can't detect the charging and since you did amount correction in the on hold transaction, I guess we need to be notified personally and not only by awareness email3. Your system has big errors because you are still charging for those flights that you have emailed the cancellation at the beginning of you system error4. In your web, it's written then you will not confirm the ticket unless it's fully paid, but you actually confirmed the ticket before securing the payment5. You claimed your site have hidden cheap price, so people are thinking exactly what you advertised or is it only a trick to gain more money6. This is not happening in Indonesia only but also German by reading one of the 1 star review in your web, so apparently you website is NOT SAFE for any booking out of Chezh RepublicI strongly suggest that you settle this matter quickly and well because I guess you can't stop people of giving you bad review and negative comment in media and more over to gain back the trust.
4	Even though I had issues with my reservation (wrong terminal and issues adding extra luggage online), Jiri and Filip from the <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> Customer Service team were very helpful when I contacted them through the chat. Don't hesitate to get in contact with Customer Service if you have any questions or doubts!
4	Very nice service and fast response. Thanks to Michaela O. for calling me and making sure I understood everything! :)
5	Excellent help from Eric on the phone. Problems solved. Thank you for your kind help.

5	Everything was perfect. We got boarding passes early. The customer service in some details we wanted was great. We had a very good trip even though it was long, with many connections the flights. Thank you Skypicker
1	The ticket was terrible. This has never happened with other online booking services. They separated my tickets as if I purchased it from each different airline. I had three stops and each time i had to pick up my luggages and I had to check in and go through 3 different security checkpoints in 3 different countries because KIWI separated my tickets into 3 different transactions rather than one. Although I bought ONE ticket from KIWI...At the check in they kept telling me that I had my tickets separated into different transactions rather than one and they asked me if I bought it from different airlines. I said no and that I bought one ticket from KIWI. Just from europe to new york it took me 33 hours, plus had to pick up each luggage and go through security 3 times (take off my shoes, check my luggages, take my laptops out, go back and forth through the metal detectors) and check in 3 times with luggages and check the weights and pick them up at each layover..and the ticket was supposed to be cheap! No it wasn't and I was exhausted! Terrible!
5	Great prices and service! I needed assistance with inputting the travel documents and their online customer service worked super! Mohamed Abdelkader was of great help and high standard! Thanks!
5	The whole process was so easy. No hassle, and I had email updates regarding the flight check in to remind me! Brilliant
5	I want to thank Aurelija for all the help with my flight :)
3	RT @SolRobayoS: Be careful with @skypickercom They divide flight tickets even in transit points. Means you have checkin again in every stop…

1	"Very poor customer service. Will not use again, even if it saves money.We are traveling LAX--> London in October.  Last night, I called to upgrade our flights to first class, because we had discovered that the upgrade was only $300 per person on a 10 hour flight.  Unfortunately, Norwegian Airlines does not allow you to upgrade via their website if you booked through a third party.When I got on the phone with the Kiwi. com representative, I was told first that ""there are no seats available in premium cabin.""  This was actually a lie in an attempt to get me off the phone.  Before calling Kiwi. com I had  spoken with Norwegian airlines who said there were many seats available, and had even quoted a price.I was then told, ""we don't have time to deal with this right now.  Can we send you an email in about an hour with information on how to upgrade and how much it will be?"" 22 hours later, no email.  I should also note that we booked our return flight through another company, OneTravel. com.  We called them to upgrade our return flight and it was done over the phone in 20 minutes.So, after no email from Kiwi. com I called again the next day.  The representative started by telling me that they hadn't been able to do it.  She then said that she could try to call Norwegian Airlines, but they are closed right now.  Another lie.  I was on their customer service website which clearly states ""available over the phone 24/7.""After telling her all of these facts, and expressing a lot frustration, she finally agreed to ""check"" if she could do it.  5 minutes later, she got back on the phone and said they are available.  I will email you a link to process the upgrade.  Still waiting with no email.  Hopefully I will get something soon, but regardless, I am pretty frustrated that this company lied to me twice out of laziness and deferred my request. It seems to me that if another company is able to take care of an upgrade request in 20 minutes, their company should not require 3 phone calls and multiple emails. If they had just tried to actually do what I asked, it probably would have taken less of their time."
4	I had panicked when I missed my flight booking confirmation in my mail box. Jonathan, on the phone, was most helpful and patient with the whole issue. He resolved it in a breeze. Definitely a fantastic start to my much looked forward trip.
2	A startup that finds 'hidden' discount flight tickets just launched in the US <https://t.co/bn5ucv9GlC> <https://t.co/929D1MDXtH>
5	I was confuse with my check in, and agent Tom helped me a lot, and was very Attentive and efficient.
5	I phoned twice in today in order to verify two bookings I had made. I spoke to two super friendly ladies, one called Joshna and the other one I sadly dont remember her name, who were of great help and made sure every thing was clear as water. When I called the second time, I also took the oportunity to fix a little error I had made with the first booking and Joshna helped me amend this for me.
2	I've had a number of issues with my booking. So I like that I can easily contact Kiwi through online chat. The agent was incredible friendly and willing to help with all of my questions.However, a lot of the information the agent gave me was incorrect, which in the end, would cause me to pay more money. Also, a number of my issues are still unresolved because I was told to send emails rather than the agent handling it over chat. Also, I'm finding it would have been cheaper to book my two flights through the individual airlines. But I like that Kiwi offers a guarantee if a delay or cancellation causes me to miss my second flight. But I have a long layover, so I'm thinking it wouldn't have been much of an issue booking individually.I'm very disappointed in the booking process. It would not allow me to add a carry-on, and I was limited to one checked bag (which was also more expensive to add through Kiwi). Budget airlines like Spirit and Allegiant offer the cheapest bag prices during the booking. After that, the prices increase. Before booking, I contacted an agent and she told me I could add the carry-on later at the same price. Now I'm having trouble even adding it, and the price has indeed increased.I appreciate the friendly customer service, but there have been several issues and I'm beginning to regret using Kiwi. It's turning out to be way more expensive than booking through the airlines. My flight is in a week, so I'm hoping my issues are resolved by then and that my experience ends up being a more positive one.
5	Merci Juan Costa, encore une fois, vos services sont supers et vos agents vraiment sympathiques . j'adore!
5	Wow. Amazed how helpful and easy this was. Booked cheap tickets and found this company on the off chance.  Decided to extend our holiday last last minute, kiwi helped us to do this by contacting the airline, unchecking us, ensuring everything was correct, changing flights and re checking us in and sending new bording passes. Every time I contacted them i had a message back in minutes, very very helpful everyone i was speaking to!!! Would defentialy use again!!!! Highly recommend.
5	Miss Natalie just helped confirm my tickets.  I am in an emergency situation, and she was very helpful in booking our tickets.  I am sure the rest of our journey will go smoothly.  Thank you very much.
5	Had a tiny issue with the booking management page (@strajk :c), but Yekaterina from CS took care of it really quickly. Thanks!

4	Kiwi turned a potentially negative experience into an exceptional one. I was halfway through my trip from Paris to Boston with a layover in Manchester when I was informed by the desk agent that the second half of my booking had been cancelled. I called Kiwi and spoke to Renata, who informed me that they were showing the booking as active. She told me not to worry, she would take care of me. I had 5 conversations with 3 people at Kiwi over the course of 3 hours--Renata, Katarina? (I think) and a young man whose name I missed. They ultimately got me booked back on the original flight. I don't know what happened to the original booking (per a conversation with an airport employee, I believe it was a problem with the airline, NOT Kiwi) but I NEVER felt stranded or without recourse. Everyone had a sense of urgency and care.
5	lots of things changed for me before I make this trip so I had to check in the very last moment and add luggage! the chat was really helpful and within few moments everything fell into right place! I will surely choose these services again!
5	The customer service (the operator called Simon) greatly helped me to manage my booking and to issue the boarding pass.
3	"I had a good experience with MR Emre tam. I booked a ticket where i would have one stop over, unfortunatly, on the day i still have not recieved the boarding pass for the second flight, so i got worried and wrote to the support team. First i had a chat with Bachana K. , i was not really impressed, just normal answers that even i could write myself.... But then suddenly Sir Emre ""came to rescue"", and took over the chat.. and after some explenation, he himself sended me the boarding pass and i am now ready to go. The 3 stars are for Emre Tam, i would love to give more, but, that i had to write to get the boaarding pass, and that Bachana K. did not really help much.. made me minus some of the stars.. But if the boss of Emre Tam see this, he should do something special for Emre, He know what service is about."
5	I got great service via online chat provided by Kristina Burešová. Hope that the customer service will keeps its good level through the whole trip! :)
4	When I was about to print off all of my e-tickets, I noticed that I was listed as a man and not a woman. I had a text chat with the customer service rep Michaela. She was very helpful and was able to fix the problem. I thought that I might be charged a large fee for  fixing the error and there was no charge at all. It was also quite efficient customer service even though the change was reported  over Easter weekend. I had my updated tickets by Monday morning.
5	I had to change one of the flights in my booking, and the system only allowed me to change the whole itinerary. Contacted the live chaat and Agent Filip was very helpful, and attended all my needs in a very efficient and professional way. I would recommend their service to anyone.
4	Booked last minute flights at a tricky time of year (end of school holidays) so all flights are very full. Outbound to Turkey went well. Homebound flights a bit of a disaster as we arrived at Dalaman Airport 2 hrs before departure, only to find our flight time had changed, and the plane left 45 minutes later and as the check in was closed they didnt let us on board.No email, phone call or anything to tell us of the changed time!Then comes the problem  of trying to get home, no one at the airport was able to help as all flights seemed fully booked for 3 days, and there were no agents for our missed flight on site.  Only thing to do was to trawl the internet to find a flight for our family of 4.  Luckily there was wifi at the airport and a comfy lounge area.Eventually did manage to find return flights via Amsterdam to Birmingham, as booked a night in an hotel. Got home 24 hrs late.To be fair to Skypicker, they quickly held up their hands and apologized for not letting us know the change in flight time. They also refunded all my costs from the new flights hotels etc. so all in all they made a mistake, but didnt make a big deal about sorting it out afterwards.Lots of friendly emails, and the refund.  I will use them again as they do have a really good customer relations team.  They should be an example for other business's to follow.
1	3:00 For my order is processed . I wanted to buy a ticket on the fast action . But now I'm risking to remain without cheap tickets . I have no way to call the UK for a confirmation of the order ... Why do everything so hard? In the chat I no answer . Confirm tickets or return my money
5	I had some two issues with my reservation, there was a mistake in the name and also the flight was rescheduled for another day which was really uncovinient, so I decided to go on the live chat to sort it out. I was so lucky that Miroslava P. attended me, he sorted everything out, and he was so helpful and also patient. Very efficient.Thanks
4	Thank you so much Skypicker for attending to my booking problem. It took quite sometime but everythings ok now, the customer relations are very generous. It took 11 days though to resolve the problem but everytime i message them, they always apologize and respond in a very positive manner. I will recommend this to my friends cuz it means a lot to tight budget people to avail a low cost airfare. More power!!!! Do not stop improving your service and aim to be the best...
5	This was my first purchase from Kiwi. So I was insecure their reputation and abilities. So I had a lot of questions... but Pedro countinued answering me and very kindly explain until I can understand.Thanks to Pedro, I think I can have hope have good trip.Thank you Pedro!
5	I'm speaking about Eric , today I call for problems with 4 fly , changing dates and check-in problems . First all I want to say I call many times call center but I think this is the best operator has preparation , respectively and kind person I ever meet . He resolv all my problems, he understands very quickly even where my problems become and how I and fix in the future . Thank you much again !
5	I just want to thanks <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com>, mainly Cintia Schelbauer, for the help she gave me. I was not sure if I really did my check-in online and she was very helpful. She confirmed my check-in and she send me the boarding pass.Thanks again.
5	Bogdan helped me fix my problem in 2 minutes. Very good service
1	1. We are stuck at the airport and are being denied boarding passes because the credit card number on the e-ticket (the agency's credit card) does not match my personal credit card number that I used to purchase the ticket online2. We were NOT informed of a change in departure time that was 30 minutes earlier than the departure time on our tickets3. We were NOT informed that changing flights in KUL would require passing through immigration and taking a $12 taxi at 4am to a completely different airport. VERY DISAPPOINTING AND FRUSTRATING
5	I have used 4 services at the same time and Skypicker provided cheapest price for my trip. This is first reason I chose Skypicker.

5	I was reaching out to <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> via their chat service and got in contact with Ajit from Kiwi, as there was a schedule change in my upcomming flight plans. After handing over my booking information, I was quickly assured that the flights and e-tickets were confirmed and there were no problems. It's nice to get a quick confirmation, as schedule changes in the air travel industry can quickly become a hassle. Thanks Kiwi.Best regards,Nilas H. Simonsen
5	We had a flight cancellation due to a strike in CDG Airport and we had to find an alternative in less than 24h. Kiwi's customer support team via chat was very helpful and we were able to find a solution which included a car rental. The bills for this were sent per e-mail and we received the reimbursement in less than a week :). Thanks to Barbara K, Yelena F, Rebecca C, and Aliz once again. Omar Trevino
5	I was plan to cancell my flight which is already confirm..i contact the <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> and with no waiting time agent michal attend my inquiry.michal was very helpful and at the same time he contact the airline and help me cancell my flight and told me about the refund amount.which normally takes times but he put an efford to let me know at the same time.i strongly recommend the <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> as i checked many other websites for flight booking i found here is cheeper and also there is more better service for customers..thats what i think it makes different.i will defenetly book my next flight in <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com>.
5	My first time using them, but i had no problems. Everything wad easily understandable. They even did my check-in for me. And as a quarantee if there were problems with delays or missed flights, they would help with this too. Luckily i had a safe and uneventful trip, but it was reassuring to know that they offered this quarantee. Thank you for a nice experience.
5	He was really nice and helped me with my problem! You guys have a really nice online service!!
5	I'm very pleased with this service, I had to add passport details to my tickets and with the help of Michal Birčiak on live chat, it made my process so much easier. Process was smooth and quick. The best service!.Thank you!
5	Julia helped me book my seats and was absolutely amazing at it. She was patient and walked me through the different options. Five stars for julia!
4	Despite me being wary due to all the terrible reviews, I went ahead and booked 8 flights for my husband and I through Skypickers, all went perfectly, as we followed every instruction Skypicker sent via email, there was only one boarding pass that we couldn't get (not really sure why either?), but improvised and worked out fine.I am happy to recommend them, as long as all goes well, and you don't need/want a refund!
5	I got in touch with Kiwi last week to ask some details about some flights  and there was Vlad at the end of the line. great help from him and valuable advices i got. thanks vlad. I will definetely book trough kiwi next time.
5	I dealt with a Jan Lukasek on the live chat about changing my baggage allowance and within a day I had been sent the cheapest possible option ($6!) to increase my check in by 5kg. She was very helpful, I haven't got my flight yet but so far kiwi have been very reliable and the cheapest/shortest flight I could find.The live chat is reliable and they actually give you solutions and try and help and reassure you, which is unusual in my experience.

2	RT @RichardJacobson: A startup that finds discount flight tickets 'hidden' on airline websites just launched in the US<https://t.co/3lxriKD>…
1	I clicked on a flight for one time, and the site booked me on another flight... 15 hours later.  And even if I did make a mistake... I called as soon as I got the confirmation and the company was unwilling to change it for me.  Bad business practice!
5	My flight from london to paris was delayed for 2 hours i miss my connection flight. when i call the customer support they told me they will book me other flight with in next 2 hours and that is what they did. they offer me 100 euro for  transportation. i wish ever company i deal with  will be like thatthank you guys
5	Absolutely satisfied with the provided service.
3	I was disappointed with the service because two agents didn t heed me well and they kept me very worried for 1 day , but a while ago Roman Slobodyan has served me has been very helpful and has solved my problem in a moment. I'm very grateful for helping me and reassure me. Thank you very much Roman.
1	I booked a ticket from them last June 12 but instead of getting a confirmation I was told that they have to cancelled my flight as they experience a technical issue with the carrier. Hence they just decided to refund my payment. I selected  a debit/credit card reimbursement that would take up to 10 working days. I followed up to them the refund I was expecting after the so-called 10  working days and they have confirmed that I shall receive it last week. Unfortunately still no refund. I was constantly informing them about this and yet they are still giving me that they are in the process of investigation of what is happening. I am really just disappointed on their initiative to resolve the issue since they are the one who caused this at the first place. If they cant accommodate the flights they are offering then don't sell such service and then give your customers a hard time getting their refund. I am not really the type of person to rant in social media but this display of poor quality service is really disappointing and I want to share this to other people as well so that they may reconsider first before taking any services from you. I just hope this serve as a way for you to improve.
5	Thank you guys for amazing app and thanks to Pavel Fridrich for helping me with invoices :) thanks.
5	So pleased with everything! I looked around a lot on the internet for the cheapest and most efficiant way to get home from Costa rica to Sweden and Skypicker had the best deal and flights by far. Since I live in southwest of Sweden i usually fly from Copenhagen and then catch the train from there back home. Not a single problem on both of my flights and since you guys used JetBlue as a company I got really surpriced that i didn't have to pay my departure tax in San Jose, it was included!I also made a typo when i was writing in my email and because of this i didn't get my tickets. That was easaly sorteted out withing 48 hours! The person who helped me with this didn't speak any swedish (My mistake, again) and translated it to english and sorted out my problem.Will defenitly use Skypicker next year when I'm flying to Costa Rica next time!Best regards, Mr. Dennis Thuen
5	Thank you very much Lucie G.for your patience and respect,you saved my day. Because of you I can see my family.
1	"We got word today that my wife's brother passed away.  I booked a flight from Santa Cruz, Bolivia to Atlanta, Ga.  I received a booking number and a status saying it was being processed.  After almost 2 hours waiting for a confirmation I called and was told they were still working on the ticket and assured me it would be ready in 1 to 2 hours.We live in a small village in Bolivia and had to drive 3 hours on terrible roads to the city to get to an international airport. Upon arrival in the city I checked my email and had a notice that due to technical difficulties my flight was not able to be booked.  Why did the first person I spoke with not tell me things were not looking good for booking the flight?  He assured me the cofirmation would be out as I mentioned in 1 to 2 hours.  I even told the person I spoke with that I had to travel to the city and he replied that everything would be ok.  When I got to the city and checked my email seeing that the flight was not booked I called Kiwi and was told, ""we're sorry"" but we will refund your money.  The money has been credited back to my card, but sorry seems to be very little when you miss the funeral of a loved one."
5	<http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> is an easy website to use & I would use it again. When I called up to sort out an issue with my booking Tomáš Jurík was extremely helpful and solved the problem right away. Sending follow up emails as discussed, thank you Tomas for your help!Thanks charlotte
5	My first time online booking.. I have no trouble at all. It guide me through every step.
5	Cheap flight finder Skypicker launches in the US <https://t.co/q4EXZABW2j>
5	I had a problem with my booking which, to be fair, was not entirely the fault of Kiwi rather the airlines trying to charge extortionate fees for additional bags. I was unable to get prices for this at the time of the booking and I should have seen it coming... Although I'm dissatisfied with Kiwi for being vague when I made my initial approach, I dealt with Filip afterwards who was very helpful, extremely polite and talked me through the process. Considering I was cancelling the booking, he couldn't have done more for me and is an asset to the business. Kiwi really do need to look at their website for baggage, though; finding out after you've paid for flights that additional bags will cost almost as much as the original booking is not cool at all.
5	I have received really good attention, they have answered all my questions with patience and in a very proffesional way. Eric from customer service (specially) talked me through every detail of my different flights. So very happy with the service.
5	Skypicker, is the most friendly and professional travel agency that I've ever seen, it's my first booking with them . But will  difinately won't be the last.. They had problems with my email address and this kind  and friendly travel consultant by the name of Kira called and sout it out, I must say that I've never had such a wonderful  and friendly service like this before.. This young lady really enjoy working with skypicker . Will always recommend them..Regards ....Julius  Francis
5	I had to amend my booking and James was very helpful. Process was quick and painless and the price to amend my flight was much cheaper than gong through the airline direct
5	Maria is great! she was very nice and quick in answering. Very professional!
4	Online chat reply very fast and friendly!!  Thanks Aura for helping me : )
5	I have a problem with my ticket, but I was helped by an very gentelman boy called Jan Lukasek who has patience with me because I don't speack verry wel english. Thank you!
5	Made an error in the name booking. Contact the Live Chat, representative, Elsa helped correct it in minutes. This was great service as there were numbers of bookings needed to be completed, it has made my job easier. Thank you!
5	I made a flight booking tonight and right after entering the passport data I realized that I did not put the right data in for one of the passangers. I contacted customer service by live chat. My supporter was Jiří Červenka. I was very satisfied with the support. He was polite, very helpful and solved my problem. It was a pleasant experince. Thank you.
5	I had to cancel one of the passengers on my ticket and I must say <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> telephone service is extremely good. Igor Iegorov from <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> was so very helpful and supportive of my difficult change. I recommend <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> because they have 24 hour support! Thank you to Igor and Lucy at <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>. Really wonderful service.
5	Adam Jelínek was really helpful and knowledgeable in providing me with the answers I required. He was polite and was solved my issue very quickly. Thank you :)
5	I called Kiwi to update some passenger information for a booking and spoke to Juan Costa on the phone.  Juan was worked quickly but was also careful to ensure that all details that I provided him were correct.  He was very helpful and the issue was resolved within the hour.  My many thanks to Juan and the Kiwi services team.
5	David was great, got me a cancellation and refund after my itinerary was wrong.
4	Bogdan helped me follow up with a difficult booking.  It took several calls but he followed up with me several times, as he said he would.  Always polite.  He's five stars, the process maybe only 3-4 but he did a great job
5	I have a flight tomorrow and Kiwi won't let me check in and spirit can't find my itinerary. Figured it out!
1	. @kiwicom247 Any plans for including Shetland Islands inter islands flights? Kiwi lists Tingwall, Foula, etc. but finds no flights. :-(
5	The team representative was very kind and immediately answer my query on line.
5	Radim was very helpful and very professional!  Thank you!
5	I had the need to change my booking, and the support I received was very effective
1	This is the worst service I ever had. Please do not use Skypicker. I have lost at least 300 euro over flight delayed and skypicker was not helpful at all.
5	We had a problem with the online check in (it was not available on the website as it should).The solution was contacting the support line and calling the assistance.Within a few minutes and by giving the needed data, the travel consultant João Carreira, was very helpful and resolved it, by doing the check in himself and mailing us the documents.Very helpful and nice. I am very pleased with the service received.
5	I am very satisfied with my Kiwi experience.  Kristyna Novotna and Emre Tam (both Kiwi employees) were extremely helpful in re-booking my flight to Krakow after bad weather caused a cancellation in New York.  They were very courteous, even calling me back after they had made a rebooking without making me wait on the line (as any American carrier would have done).  Thanks again to Kiwi.
5	Katka gives me a lot of help when I ask for information, I don't speak english so much, and she was so friendly with me, I'm so happy!!! Thanks Katka!! :)
5	I had some troubles to book a ticket from Sweden to Belarus, called the office and girl helped me so much! I could even find cheapest ticket in 50€. I liked the service very much. Thank you, Huriat!!! My best thanks!!!!!!
1	"I am travelling with a group to Dublin and we spent quite some time early today (before 10 am) booking our tickets on Skypicker. Six of the tickets (the last six ones, incidentally with reference number 790596) were confirmed quickly, but the two other batches (reference numbers 790569 and 790559) were confirmed although we then received a strange message that the purchase was being processed. I called Skypicker after approximately three hours and was told that I would receive the confirmation of the remaining 18 tickets within an hour.Late this afternoon at approximately 17:30, we receive notice that the tickets with reference number 790559 cannot be purchased due to a ""technical fault with the carriers reservation system"". I then received a message telling me that the other tickets with reference number 790569 can be bought, but at a higher price. I already paid for them! Now I am stuck with six tickets out of the 23 I need and a big head ache. This is unheard of, and extreemly disappointing! A very bad experience with Skypicker!"
1	"Please do yourself a favor and STAY away from this company. They are HORRIBLE!! I have been traveling around the world for years and have never come across such horrible non-existence customer service in my life. We lost over US$200. DO NOT TRUST them. I dare you to actually talk to a human on the phone. Also, they are liars and put their own ""Positive"" comments on Facebook. Look it up."
2	"My 1st experience with <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> was poor one. I ""bought"" flights from the USA to Greece. Within 20 minutes I received an email saying that my flight had been ""declined due to security"" and ""In order to process your reservation we need to confirm that the payment was placed by the debit/credit card owner."" I immediately called and spoke to very nice gentlemen named Archil. He explained that there might be a conflict between my passport having my full name and my CC only having my first and last name. Ok, that is a first for me with millions of miles traveled, but huh, then I guess send it back to the ""independent security co."" for validation. Note - this was not my bank declining the purchase it was an agency hired by Kiwi to prevent fraud. Fair enough - now you have a voice call from the card holder but the purchase automatically flagged cannot be un-flagged for 10 hours because the ""team"" that needed to review the transaction ""had gone home for the night and would not be back for 10 hours."" I set my alarm for 0300 (USA time) to check email and found the purchase had been denied and they said the money had been credited back to my account. I called customer service again and spoke to Babak. Who essentially told me there was ""nothing he could do to influence a change in that decision."" He was very polite, but he could not tell me WHY they had denied my purchase. I had my online bank statement open and no money had been credited back. I ask to speak to a supervisor (Miguel) and he was also very polite, but informed me ""because of security reasons"" they could not explain why I had been denied the purchase. He also advised me that I should not try to purchase other tickets on <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>. I wished he and his co-workers luck in their efforts working with a company that treats legit customers this way.I immediately booked with <http://JustFly.com|JustFly.com> and had no problems. The cost was higher, but the connections much better.update: 21 hours later - the $$ has not been credited to my bank account"
5	She helped me by chat to managing my reservation.
5	it was very nice to talk with u mr #Babak. well explained.
5	I've got in contact with Skypicker's chat service regarding online boarding pass and check of additional changes to my ticket. Very kind, fast, and efficient service provided by Alexandra L. Thanks, looking forward to book fly tickets from Skypicker again ... :) Romulus
4	Had never tried this site till recently. Was fast easy service with great prices. Leonardo called me to sort out an issue. He was a good help and a very friendly guy. I recommend Skypicker highly.
5	SkyPicker is the best place to find cheap flights and the best thing is that you can sort the search options in many different ways. Also when purchasing the ticket it tells you when you need a visa for a certain country.
5	Had trouble filling in some passport details, but it only took a few minutes on the 24/7 live chat support (with Alan Whitfield) to fix that and get my boarding passes sent directly to my email. This is MUCH easier than trying to call some automated helpline, especially when you don't have overseas mobile plan.
4	I liked everything! Thank you
5	Thank you all kiwi I bought very easy and cheap, I needed help and I chatted online with Daniel he was great helperthanks
1	I booked a return flight from London to Hanoi a few months back. 5 days ago I was emailed saying that part of my return journey  (Tehran to London) was cancelled and they would be in touch. They did not get in touch. After I called several times to find out some information I was told that I could either wait 33 hours in Tehran departure lounge for a connecting flight or have a £160 refund- not even close to the amount needed to get home from Tehran. They would not refund the whole return leg and allow me to book my own flight from Hanoi, instead they insisted I leave myself stranded in Tehran or I would be entitled to nothing. I have since been offered a flight with just a 31 hour wait and this has still not been confirmed (I am due to leave in the morning). They have ruined the last week of my trip and I am still without transport home. As things stand I will be late for work and most likely out of pocket to the tune of £500 - £1000. Never mind the phone bill in excess of £100. I was also not offered any compensation for the 33 hour wait at the airport (meal vouchers, accomodation, upgrade etc). A truly shocking company, I have recorded all the correspondence and will soon be posting it to YouTube to let other people know what they are like. Beneath this review they will say that they are sorry for the inconvenience and that they will look in to my case and get back to me. They won't. I'm sure that no tangible assistance will be offered as per usual. They don't value their customers whatsoever, they just want to take as much money from you as they can. Do yourself a favour and avoid them.
5	My flight on JetBlue was cancelled and the airline provided no alternative flight for 5 days. I needed to get back to NYC sooner so I contacted Kiwi through their chat system. I spoke to both Stan and Lucia who were amazingly kind and helpful. Lucia rebooked me quickly on a flight on United free of charge and I will now be able to return to NYC. After having a frustrating experience dealing with JetBlue it was a welcome surprise to find great help and understanding from the people at <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> I will be using them to book my trips in the future. An excellent experience!
5	I wanna say big thanks for online assistants Martina and Tamara for help and support :)
5	This operator was very helpflu and responsive.He made a great job
5	I like this chat help, it is personal and fast. Thanks
1	Booked flight to Riga with stop in Liverpool. Some very smart in this company booked 2 separate tickets for me and my husband so we have different booking numbers and seats in opposite ends of plane. When asked to amend this I was told that because we had different surnames we were treated as separate passengers and I was asked to pay to seat us together?!?!?! Even thou on first leg of our flight they managed to book us with same booking number and we are seated together. Would not recommend to anyone. They screw up and then try to charge you to fix it...
1	I had booked a flight to New York from San Francisco in September 16 JetBlue flight reservation from <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com>I tried to book a flight that leaves at 22:45.But I mistake flight schedule, So I booked a flight departing at 11:30.I would like to refund my reservation but <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> said refundable is not allowed.So I chaged my fight schedule to 22:45, but As it turned out,the plane fare was charged twice.They said me to 'CHANGE', but it means 'PAY FULL PRICE AGAIN'If i know i have to pay full price again, I would not pay.I can not understand that I have to pay for not used flight ticket.This is absurd.Do not Never reservation <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> or skypicker!!Do not Never reservation <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> or skypicker!!
4	The Agent named Mary P in the chat help was very helpful to me today when I need help changing information in my flight and very much appreciated for all her help.
1	I get a notification of a change to my flights and the website is not available to mange the change. At best you are amateurs. more likely rip-off merchants
5	It is an easy to use website and helps us choose the cheapest flights combination!
5	My flight was cancelled due to weather, contacted Kiwi my flights got was rebooked by Dominika right away. Great service
5	Skypicker's service was second to none. Prompt confirmation, regular updating and all boarding passes provided in plenty time. Highly recommended.
4	Excellent customer service ,much appreciation Alan Whitfield(travel consultant).
5	Dear Madam/Sir,I would like to express my honest gratitude for the communication with your company, namely your employee Dominika, who was able to solve my unpleasant issues with the highest possible level of professional attitude. My review may not affect the salary of the aformentioned employee from the long-term point of view, but still I would love to suggest at least a modest bonus, for her attitude is the reason why I will choose your services in the near future again!
1	Hello,The reason for this email is to describe the situation I am currently living and which was caused mainly due to negligence from your company.First off, I booked three flights with destinations Munich-Dublin, Dublin-Brussel and Brussel-Munich from your service, with Skypicker booking number 728172. These flights have the following descriptions according to the latest email I received from you dated the 10th of April 2016 at 23:00:Munich - DublinAirline: Aer LingusDeparture: April 8th at 20:20Arrival: April 8th at 21:55Munich airport code according to booking: MUCDublin airport code according to booking: DUBDublin - BrusselsAirline: Ryan AirDeparture: April 11th at 16:30Arrival: April 11th at 19:15Dublin airport code according to booking: DUBBrussels airport code according to booking: BRUBrussels - MunichAirline: TransaviaDeparture: April 11th at 21:55Arrival: April 11th at 23:15Brussels airport code according to booking: BRUMunich airport code according to booking: MUCThe first two flights went smoothly. However, at my arrival in Belgium, I came to realize that the information provided by your company in the last email mentioned above was wrong. The airport where the second flight of my journey landed was not Brussels' International Airport (BRU), but Charleroi CRL Airport, approximately 75 km away from BRU. Therefore, at my arrival and realization that my next flight would depart from BRU airport, I contacted your customer service, to which, at his surprise this event had happened, one of your agents instructed me to take a taxi and head of to BRU airport, in hopes of catching the final leg of my journey.  At this time your customer service representative refused to confirm to me that the costs of this transportation, a requirement for the continuation of my journey due to the limited time between flights, would not be refunded to its entirety and that only 100€ could be paid by your company for this necessary travel. After I told him that I did not agree with his statement he told me that I should take the taxi either way and he would look into a complete refund at a later time. So I did and headed off to BRU airport. About 5 to 10 minutes later the same representative called me and said that the flight had been cancelled and that I should head back to CRL airport. I looked in flightstats for this information, however I could not corroborate the truthfulness of this statement. After I arrived back at CRL airport, I got a call from another representative called 'Eva' which told me she would try to book another flight for me in the morning due to the fact that just one more flight was available for me, which flew to Rome at 22:10 from BRU, after which I would have to overnight there and catch a new flight to Munich in the morning from the above mentioned airport. She dismissed this option later as 'too risky' and instead told me she would 'look for options' on how I would get back to Munich.I insisted that it is for me very important to be back in Munich early in the morning, since I have reasons which I will not disclose in this email, however she did not commit to doing what's possible in arranging the first direct flight to my destination.Even before I realized that I had arrived at a different airport that that from which I would depart, your company has committed huge negligence by not knowing or failing to inform me of this issue. Evidence can be found on the travel receipt I received on the 10th of April, where it is clearly stated that both arrival and departure in Brussels would take place from BRU airport. Furthermore, your company has continued to behave in an unacceptable matter by giving out false information concerning Transavia's flight HV9516, stating that it had been cancelled when evidence thereof was lacking on flight tracking website 'flight stats' from which evidence is attached in this email.Worst of all, your company continues to ignore the customer's well being by not providing the customer a solution to his problem, and leaving him stranded in an airport and city where security is currently an issue do to the recent unfolding of events.I hereby request again to be booked a direct flight at the earliest possible time to my final destination, and a full refund on any incurring charges such as a hotel room, single room, and any transportation costs to the departing airport.I therefore will be filing a complaint to your company to the commission of customers' protection, and depending on the outcome of this situation, I will not hesitate on filing a formal civil complaint on the damages.Best regards,Andres Garza
5	I had two problems, both of which were my fault. Julia G. helped me with both of them in short order, and moreover seemed a perfectly delightful person![I did wait on hold for about 15 minutes before anyone answered, but it was a Monday morning after all.]
5	Hi,I want to thank you all for very good service.Did a mistake with the year of birth. And Kiwis service desk helped us very fast with that. They even checked us in and send us the tickets.And they have open 24/7, could it better then that.I recommend Kiwi and will book the tickets here again!
5	Martin Carter helped me the way I expect it from a XXI. century web based service. I am happy with the front end, the service, the price, and the client service.Good luck KIWI!Robert Banki
1	I booked a flight on Kiwi for around 310€. around 6 hours later they send a message, that it is not possible and offered a new price, around 120€ more. 6 hours later?! what service is that? it never happened on any other website to me to get such an important information so late. i can`t recommend kiwi at all but recommend to go to websites where you get confirmation within a minute.
5	L'aide sous forme de chat m'a rendu un grand service! encore merci Skypicker!
4	The positive for me was that I had quite a complicated route plan, which would be a nightmare to book separately (Europe through India to Australia and back to Europe) with the various airlines or other companies. The price I paid I was happy with, and I was happy with all aspects of my journey. I called to Service Centre once to make sure some luggage was added, and they were friendly and helpful.Only negative I found was that for the 'add baggage' feature you can only add bags for the whole itinerary rather than separate flights. I had some flights where this would have been included in the ticket, and others where it was not. However I could only add baggage (and pay for this) for all flights.
5	Booking was fast, easy and reliable. I will definitely book again.
5	For security reasons I had to call the helpdesk in order to make my reservation possible. I had the pleasure to talk to Eric, together with his collegue Bogdan C he was going to figure out how they could solve this problem as fast as possible. A couple of minutes later Eric called me back, left me voicemail and send me an extra email to tell me that my booking was confirmed!
5	Its my first time using this site for bookings. I did misspell a letter on my name so I called to change it to the correct one. The person on the phone was called Monica and was really helpful and found a solution for it.
5	Very good customer service! I just talked on the phone with Danielle and immediately got the electronic tickets I needed :-)
5	@chris_muther Great feed of travel news & tips! News of <https://t.co/6MN8N4GW19> should be added-it's the latest innovative fare-casting site
5	I received amazing travel consultation beyond my expectations. I was only going to ask to change a flight, but ended up getting fantastic traveling tips for Colombia and Ecuador. Thank you Natalia! Props to you!
3	RT @traveldudes: Dreaming of White Sandy Beaches? Start your planning with a gift from @SkypickerCom!: <https://t.co/WPbuQNWSvP> <https://t.co>…
4	Kiwi had a problem with contacting the airline to secure the booking. It was 3 hours before the flight, where I had not got my ticket confirmed yet. It was still in progress. So I called kiwi in the airport, and they worked very fast to get this all set up in order for me to attain a seat on the plane. Good customer service. But shame about the poor process of order the company has with the airlines.
5	They provided a fast, effective and friendly customer support; solved all my worries regarding my flight reservation in no time. I was attended by Lucie O'Bryan, who solved the issue with a very friendly treatment.
3	Best way to guarantee you will see these is to use another booking agent, SKYFUCKERS are Useless, Thieving, lying bastards, they will fuck your holiday for sure, Go Expedia or one of the other booking agents and save money and grief
1	Ottimo sito . Call center motlo professionale ed esaustivo. Le operatrici rebecca ed eleonor molto preparate gentili e desaustive! complimenti aloro.
5	I didn't add baggage in my booking so i reached out to Jakub P and helped me. Such an awesome customer service representative.
5	The costumer service of Skypicker has quite deserved its title, by offering what it's aimed for : to serve costumers. And they do it well !I never post reviews normaly. In fact, all the process of doing it is repulsive to me. Baby-king costumer playground, i've certaintly thought. This review processing, and its long-lasted print on internet, built a whole community of judgements, paranoïa inside a society of pure control. A global village, yes, where one's reputation can be destroyed only by throwing rumours around. Without even talking about the too high and unfortunately rising pressure put on very often low-wage employees !But this time, the job has been done so well, so quick i can only take my keyboard, write, and applaud. I've been taken in charge by the marvelous Mariya Podglaznaya who helped my case so kindly and so efficiently, even though it was a saturday night, around 11pm ! Didn't expect this honestly, saturday evening being more like a windy dusty road crossed by hairy tumbleweeds with no one in sight in costumer services, when the city sleeps or gets drunk in weak lighted modern saloons... But her patience and sense of understanding made it all !The dates of my tickets have been changed, and i received the confirmation just about the same time it has been told (special thanks to the great Tanya Vorobyeva for her sunday morning mail).I don't know who's running the company, but she/he should definitely offer a promotion to them both ! Last minute emergency on saturday late night, solved in early sunday morning. What more one can ask for ??Thank you again Mariya and Tanya ! And i sincerely hope you have a life aside this too ! I do.5 big shiny stars !
5	<http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> is simply amazing. The website is easy to use and has everything a seasoned traveller would want in an airline website. The interactive map is unique and a life saver for visual people like myself. I have contacted <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> twice via the live chat and both Lucie and Melinda (wonderful live chat staff) were 100% helpful, quick, personable and informative.
5	Everything went really smoothly. Kiwi checked in to all the flights for me and I received boarding passes in an email well before my trip so I had plenty of time to print them out. Would highly recommend.
5	My experience of using <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> has been amazing.  The level of service I have recieved throughout my trips has been outstanding and the customer service is second to none!  Special thanks to Bogden and Ana for being ultra helpful and taking the trouble to answer my queries.  I will use this company forever more and highly recommend them if anyone is thinking of travelling on multi destination trips.Oh yes, and the web site is extremely well put together as well and one of the best I have seen in this industry! :)
5	I was actually looking for someone who can help me book a Flight to Paris.I was able to chat with 2 different Person but they are not Helpful. .For the last time, I clicked on the chat support icon and was able to chat to another Agent named Martin Mikes.He was very helpful and patience..He has the willingness to Help me.He even went extra mile just to answer my inquiries..To: <http://Skypicker.com|Skypicker.com> - Martin Mikes deserves a commendation .. Please don't loose Him and Keep him in your Company..Thank You Martin Mike and Kudos!!Jess
5	"Nothing in Life is perfect. I have only Praise for the Guys at Kiwi-dot-com. Especially NEAL from customer Service. My case took over a month to sort out, and NEAL went out of his way, mobilized his whole team and took extra effort to solve my situation. I missed my flight on August 10th and walk up in the hospital. Lucky me I had travel Insurance. After I contacted them, to my surprise, they answered every time right away. Not only that, each time, between Email conversations and chat sessions, whoever was on duty, seemed to take a personal Interest about my concerns. Once I explained of course. The Airlines all have different policies depending on your flight route. So in case of a Refund you are stuck with them. The Travel Insurance, a different company, performed rather quickly. All in all it was a satisfying experience for me, mostly due to the People working at Kiwi-dot-com doing more than just their ""job"". MY SINCERE GRATITUDE TO ALL OF YOU. I highly recommend Kiwi-dot-com, not only for having the BEST DEALS AROUND, but also the BEST PERSONALIZED CUSTOMER CARE."
5	Because I didn't not enter my passport details when I bought the ticket, I realised only shortly before flying that RyanAir would sting me for checkin at the airport. The call centre agent was amazing, and sorted out my problem quickly, even calling back to confirm the problem was solved and going the extra mile to check in for me and email me the boarding passes. Very imressive!
4	Flight booking was fast and super easy. After service I had some extra request about payment and invoice. I spoke with travel assistant Gabriela K and she  has processed everything without any problems.
4	Your customer service representative, Vladimir Fedorenko, gave me great customer service in helping me make my fiance's booking. the whole process went very smoothly. Keep up the good work and thank you again.
5	I used Skypicker for the first time since they were one of the very few ones providing flights for this special route I was taking. First I was skeptical as I did not receive all 4 boarding passes right away, but they did write in the same confirmation mail that they would be delivered at certain dates. And they were. Everything went to plan, no problems at all. They had checked me in and I had no problem at all in my 4 leg trip. Recommended.
5	I had a question regarding re-checking myself and my luggage during the layover in Belgrade on the flight from Zagreb to New York (JFK) and back. I used live chat to ask them my question and the lady named Daria, who answered my question, was really nice, kind and she provided me all the needed information. Also, the chat worked well, the response of Daria was fast and I can only rate their customer service and her assistance as excellent :)
5	We booked a connection flight through <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> and our first flight was delayed about two hours which made it impossible to catch the connecting flight. The kiwi support team sent us an email as soon as they knew about the delay and found a new connecting flight free of charge for us within less then one hour. Excellent customer support!
5	Spoke to a lady named Mariya Potello regarding my booking, she was lovely and promptly fixed the silly mistake i had made! :) wonderful service!! would defiantly recommend and go through them again :)
5	My husband and I spoke with Issis Castro through the Skypicker chat  and Issis was extremely helpful, professional, courteous and responded quickly. It was easily the best and easiest experience we've had dealing with a business through an online chat room. Thanks for your help Issis!
5	I had couple of inquires about the possibility of my flight refund and some other changes. Their staff members (Olga and Mary) were very responsive and kind to my inquiries. Even though I decided to not get a refund for my flight, I was impressed by their services. I will definitely use kiwi's service later.
5	Each time I needed help, there was someone available et gave help professional
5	There had been some strange delay in confirming my purchase of travel insurance via <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com>, so I've been forced to waste my time speaking to several different agents. Alice W. is the one who has, apparently, resolved the situation. Thank you!P.S. I still think that the company (<http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com>) is good and would use it again – probably, I've been unlucky to face that unexpected delay, which was probably not due to <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> itself, and they have helped – even though with a bit of wasted time – to resolve it.
5	Pedro is an excellent agent, he is réactif, very nice, proffesional and patient ! All my problem it's fixe now... he give me the best solution for my trip ! Thank you verry much for your help... I come back to kiwi for my next trip reservation... ;-)
4	After experiencing some troubble with a Ryanair flight that was included in my trip, and after finding out that the contact info (phone and mail) provided on the website was not operational, i received quick and excellent help from Nina through the skypicker website.
5	Excellent service, operator Daniel made maximum to re-book my cancelled flight and he made it! Thanks so much.Ladislav.
3	You are a scam. Never book with these. Scumbags
2	I had booked 3 connection flights via Kiwi. I was informed about the cancellation of my flight very late and then I was on the phone and the e-chat for hours waiting for a response JUST before I leave for the airpot. The online service people kept promissing that they would contact me in one hour but nothing happened. Thanks God I finally spoke with Hana, who was VERY helpful and efficient...but the whole situation was very stressful for me....So, with the exception of Hana,  I consider this a VERY bad service! In addition, the alternative suggestion waiting in the airport for 10 hours instead of chaning my first flight or give me a hotel in Athens airport is just unacceptable and I am going to complain about this!
5	I'm a fool and realized less than 32 hours before my flight to Dublin that I forgot to check in online, which they clearly state over and over to do at least 72 hours in advance to avoid self check in fees the day of the flight. I'm flying Ryanair and have only heard terrible stories about the unlimited fees they are just waiting to pile on, including one for self check in. I thought I was doomed until I decided to use Skypicker's lovely chat option. I was connected with Tomáš Jurík who was more than happy to help me fix my mistake. He manually checked me in and made sure my boarding passes were sent directly to my email. It was a such a relief! He offered great service in a very timely manner!
5	Aliaksandra was really friendly and helpful ! Thanks a lot for your help ! We will book again :D
5	"I had a very small problem with the Booking confirmation .. First after Booking I need to make an International call a thing that's not really available with everyone and after trying to find someone who can help we couldn't reach the customer service representative after waiting for a few minutes on hold. * I resorted to use the Live Chat .. which is not really "" Live Chat "" at all, as the responses there were automated and it directs customers to FAQ page to send "" Message to customer service "" where you can easily access it from the top right navigation bar [ I don't need to go to live chat to see the FAQ page ] !! * Then I resorted to send an E-mail which was the best part of my experience. Agents were super responsive, very helpful, very clear on the steps and very clear with exact timeline for the process and that's the main reason I gave full stars My Feedback : 1- Increase the Confirmation cancellation limit to anything more than 12 hours, because 12 hours is so short period of time and it creates unnecessary state of urgency and worry 2- Have a true Live Chat which is brilliant idea implemented by so many companies like "" Godaddy "" 3- Try to automate the process of confirmation a way or another to be involved in the reservation form. Anyway , I am very happy with the final result and I would definitely recommend Kiwi to my friends and let them be aware of the process :)"

2	Every convo with @skypickercom is with a DIFFERENT person! poor customer service STILL #skypicker #flying #watchdog
5	Thank you Eric for being so quick in helping to address my queries!
4	I had entered a wrong mobile number and I was quickly helped by the chat service to mend it and the agent name was Olena. Thanks for being quick and efficient
5	so I can speak good things of your assistant Martin Carter , he helped me in everything I needed , more than once , it was always very patient and polite with me .Thank you Martin and Skypicker
5	Irina V. this is the name of a supporter from real time Q&A system in skypicker. Actually, this is my first time to use skypicker and I did mistakenly cancel my booking. For some minutes, I was not in my mind. It was more than $2,000's value. But I met an angel, Miss Irina. V. She did make me feel cared and worried. Now my booking is in process very normally and quickly. Once more thanks to Irina.
5	I'm currently traveling Southeast Asia for several months and have been flying quite a bit between locations. I got turned on to <http://Skypicker.com|Skypicker.com> just as the trip started and haven't looked back! At one point, flight costs were actually lower than on the direct airline's website and the process is so easy. The only tough part (which really isn't tough at all) is you can't check-in online before the flight. I'm not sure if that's always true or only for certain airlines. Either way, do yourself a favor and give Skypicker a try - you won't regret it.
4	Very helpful speedy resolution to my booking received from Hana via online chat.
5	"""How?"" was the first impression which I received. The price they offer was unimaginable. To be honest, I first thought it was a scam. I believe their trick is to search a flight from the second large airport instead of searching the first.  My flight from Warsaw(Modlin) to Malmo (via Gdansk) was comfortable as a regular flight. None of other websites (e.g. Expedia or Kayak) weren't able to draw this route but Skypicker. Skypicker is the best LCC search website, and I will continue to use this website from now on."
5	Eric and Bogdan C. helpd me to resolved my issue.
5	It was a pleasure booking through Kiwi. One of my flights was delayed and I thought I will miss my last connection. When dealing with customer service on the phone, Nina Turkian was very helpful and prompt to reassure me that they would be there to assist me if and when I missed my flight. later I received an email from Emre Tam about working on booking me for an other flight and taking care of hotel bill.Fortunately for me i managed to catch the flight, but I am 100% confident I would have been in good hands if anything had been wrong. Thanks again Kiwi
5	I had a tricky situation with my e-ticket, since I purchase the ticket for my son that was a minor with an American passport and I enter the wrong passport info by mistake. But NIKOLA was really kind and helpful and he could solve the problem super fast.

5	We got stranded in London after one of our flights was delayed. Vally from <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> was in continuous contact with me over the phone to help rectify out situation. We had to spend two nights at the airport in the hotel, but it was <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> representatives that helped us through the difficult time. No one from the airlines would help us. I am very thankful to Vally and <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> for getting my girlfriend and myself home. Garett
5	I booked a couple of flights with Skypicker. It was an easy process and competitively priced. Having trouble entering passport details to check in they very kindly took care of it for me. Many thanks to Vlad Diakov and Jolana Dominguez for very prompt and helpful customer service.
5	Option for heavier baggage wasn't on the website but they addressed my problem quickly and politely. Would recommend!
1	Worst company out there would not change my flight time with more then enough time 7 days respond to my request after two days so cause the new flight that I booked direct with airline to go more expensive and they did not change my flight so all in all they made me lose the flight that I booked with them for me and my partner and pay more then I had to (if they had a decent service) for the new flight that I booked!!Be very careful this company are a scam and are not human that understand and try to helpRUBBISH!!!
5	Very supportive and communicative - nicely solved the issue when my flight was cancelled after the Erbil airport was shut down. It also offered me a max. 50 Euro hotel accommodation in Istanbul to ease my 14 hours time to the next connecting flight. thanks
5	I booked two flights on two separate carriers from Lombok to Singapore (transfer in Surabaya), and somehow ended up stranded on Bali in monsoon season with no money and no flight home well past midnight (Central Indonesian time). I called Skypicker's U.S. number on a mobile application using the airport's questionable Wi-Fi and the customer service was superb. Mr. Graeme Fairweather worked for hours to ensure my friend and I both got home as soon as possible. The staff was warm and reassuring and we are extremely grateful to Skypicker to be home!!
5	I am very satisfied with kiwi service, specially the Help service, the agent whoes name is Jan, is very kind and helpful. Answer and solve the problem is very quick.T
5	Thanks a lot for your attention and kindness. The costumer service was really polite by Jonathan. I had got some problems on interner issues and Jonathan was really helpful to confirme our plane tickets. In addition of being polite, he was very patience. Thank you so much.
5	Got assistance from kira, who gave me an exellent service including calling me back to give me the most accurate answers for my questions.made this reservation without expecting it would be so easy to get a human respnd. thank you so much for your help. take care,mika
4	Sena was helpful in sending me the invoice, which I haven't received initially after booking the flight.
5	I bought two tickets, I made a mistake with my name, and I needed additional kg for my luggage, and I was accompanied by travel assistant Mrs. Sabina, and she was quick and helpful. Now I am on the plane and everything is fine :-)Recommended.
4	Even if many reviews are bad I've got excellent service today by Aura! Due to a family emergency we had to bring home our daughter from Seattle to Stockholm, with just a few hours notice. When we can't pay a fortune we find a ticket at Kiwi. Even if the price went up it was still cheaper than other options. The wait for the confirmation took about an hour. But then the link with the additional payment didn't work. I contacted them via the chat. There Aura had just the best approach. I was very stressed due to circumstances but she was very helpful and stayed we me on the chat until everything was cleared with the ticket. Thanks so much for your understanding from a stressed mother!
5	I was really worried as I had received the information of my payment and booking number but had not received confirmation of my booking with e-tickets (which was suppose to have been done within 4 hours of my payment). More than 24 hours went by without confirmation when I called the Help Line and Eric finally helped resolve the situation with the confirmation of my booking and e-tickets. Eric called me to inform of the exact situation, of how they were trying to resolve it and then later confirmed the booking and e-tickets by e-mail too. This kind of situation had not happened to me before but with this kind of excellent customer service by Eric, I will recommend and once again use <http://KIWI.COM|KIWI.COM>. Thank you Eric.
5	I booked flights to my daughter and her friends from the Philippines to ThailandOne of the flights was late and they missed their connection flightI called costumer service by phone and immediately the representative on the other side of the line booked for them the next flight while in process she called me 4 times to make sure my daughter and friends are ok
5	The customer service accessed via a london telephone number answered immediately and after a short and clear phone routing system had anImmediate contact with a service agent who was very helpful.
5	So far the service of Skypicker was very good! I called several times for my extra luggage and the consultant was very friendly and helpful, all my issues had been solved.She also gave me the tip to book the ticket without the luggage (because its only for 15 kg) and add my luggage of 20 kg after the booking - and it worked out!They even offer that they check me in via web-check in to save me some fees from the airlines.I hope this good service will go on if I have any difficulties on the journey, but they promise it and I'm convinced by the service I experienced so far that they will keep their promise. :-)
5	Excelent service !I was struggling about how to carry all my luggage. I received support from Calaina L who solved all my questions and she helped me to fix my reservation in order to carry all my luggage with me. She answered quickly and very nicely.Thanks for your excellent service. Fernando García
4	There was a problem, but they solved it very quickly.
5	thanks her we make the check-in with no problems,very good service and operator
5	I had problems trying to do my check-in online I had help from Jiří Červenka in support chat who helped me a lot  sending me my tickets, he was very friendly and my problem was solved in just minutes.thank you.
1	Hi Guys,You have booked my flights separately from Sydney to KL and KL to Bangalore and I had to recheck in which is collect my baggage in KL and again do a checkin which was painful and not a good experience. Could you please amend my booking of return flight and make sure Air Asia does direct check in from Bangalore to Sydney for my outbound flights. Very bad experience. Can't describe it in words. Thanks for messing up things. Regards,Diwa
5	I have been traveling intensely for the past year (North America -> Africa -> Europe -> South America) and have been relying on Google Flights. This was by far an easier solution, and found flights at half the cost. Thank you!
5	Thank you <http://skypicker.com|skypicker.com>. I had some problems with my password and I had to change a number. I chatted with henry, a very nice guy. He helped me very quickly.Your support is very good. Please stay at this high quality!I will book again :D
4	One excelent way to find the best rate
5	Kseniya was lovely to talk to, when found out that our air Asia flight was delayed and we would most likely be missing our connection, She/he promptly found us replacement options by the time we landed. Fortunately this is Air Asia we're dealing with and our connecting flight was also delayed so we managed to make it. But it was nice to see our trip was covered to our final destination regardless. Thanks again!
5	Hi,My name is Badri Kapanadze and I am from Georgia. I live in London and travel to my country often. I have experience with many different airlines having disappointments and satisfactions.I feel it would be very selfsh if i would not share  the best Online Check in experiance with you guys. It was the first time that my choice went to the Skypicker. Time has come for online check-in and i had to ask for online help where Enri Akhvlediani had answered for all my questions. He was very polite and straight forward. Enri really has  high knowladge and knows his job very well. The iceing on cake is that i found out his nationality, which answers the question that why Enri can handle his job effectively and efficiantly and i have no offense with other nations but in my oppinion the Georgian people are more talented and awake in todays life.I have recieved one more friend today and would like to thank Skypicker and suggest to hire more Georgians as i am going to tell all my Georgian friends on what website to book their next tickets travelling back home.Great experianceHappy New Year SkypickerRegards,Badri

2	Awful experience dealing with this company. I booked a flight for 2 people and one checked bag. Upon arriving at check in I was advised that the tickets Kiwi purchased did not include checked baggage and I was charged  to check in one bag. I returned and tried to reclaim the cost from Kiwi and that's when the trouble started.10 emails later explaining again and again that there were 2 travelers ONE bag, they have refused the claim on the basis that they paid the airline and take it up with them. Despite my request they have not provided me with any proof of payment to the airline. Once again Kiwi - I arrived at the airport with 2 travelers and ONE bag!!! I did not try to reclaim a 2nd checked bag! Give me strength.Lesson learnt - Always book direct with the airline for stress free travel!!PS. I wanted to give 1 star but in fairness they haven't been rude so it's a reluctant 2 stars!
4	The customer service team is really helpful, and provides quick resolution to any problems faced. I missed on a connecting flights as the first of the two flights got delayed, and hence contacted them. They were quick to rebook me on another flight, with no hassles involved. Thanks for that!

3	I didn't have any problems with Skypicker. They corrected my booking mistakes.
4	YOU BE LUCKY TO GET THERE WITH SKYFUCKERS
4	Very good online service through the chat.  Huriyat did his best to solve deal with my issues in an efficient way.
5	I booked my flight through Skypicker and the did not disappoint me. They are truthful and the give the right information in time. At first i was afraid i could be duped, but i came to learn of their dependable dependability. Making the right choices drives away distress.Thats what is needed when making flight bookings
5	"I made reservation for trip to london and paris, and I was curious about how the online check in procedure goes on. I used chat for asking, and ""Tomas U"" was really, super kind for explaining the procedure and make me comfortable. I really appreciate him for the kind explanation. And the point that <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> is doing online check in procedure instead of me was really awesome.  I'm just waiting for <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> to do online check in instead of me and send me actual flight ticket by email. Thanks!"

5	I booked a flight to Tehran today and I contacted via live chat to add a baggage to my ticket! Thanks to Emre, he quickly contacted the airlines and found out that he can do that for free! Good prices, quick chat support service, and polite travel consultants.
5	Have a 12 ours transit i Bruxelles and Skypicker was very helpfull about the situation.
1	I have been twice on the fone because i got a wrong flight confirmation with one overnight. My time is running to find another flight but don't get any help from the Manager.
4	I was stranded with missed connection in the middle of my trip due to aircraft maintenance issues. Kiwi was helpful and easy to reach but extremely slow to act. After speaking with 4-5 agents over a period of nearly eight hours who promised but failed to deliver on their anticipated timelines, Puput took ownership of this issue and was able to resolve everything to my satisfaction within an hour. Trip interruptions are always far from ideal, but after a cancelled transatlantic flight which led to three missed connections, ultimately arriving seven hours past my initially scheduled booking is a pretty good outcome. Thanks Puput!The missing star is for all the missed timelines. At the outset I was given estimates between 20-60 minutes. Nothing materialized for eight hours despite those promises.
5	I had a good experience dealing with <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> because they are very helpful and attentive with their online support. Their answers were always  very quick and clear.
5	Bought some tickets online. Even though there isn't really a customer service by phone, the one by chat works really good. They've helped me with choosing the flight and service after wards. I would recommend it.
5	I'm in the midst of changing my flights, and Miroslav from Kiwi's customer service team has been incredibly helpful so far. After working with him, I'm confident that I'll be able to make the necessary changes that will allow me to make the trip! It's clear Kiwi is a customer service-oriented organization.
5	Great experience with Skypicker and kind help of Vlada Gusar. Any problems that appear can be solved easly at all time!
4	I wanted to change my departure date by one day.  The Skypicker consultant ensured he had the full and correct details of my requirements by checking with me carefully and then made the changes within the hour.  The new e-ticket arrived by email the next day.  The consultant was courteous and communicated well.  I only gave 4 stars instead of 5 because the new ticket didn't arrive until the next day but I guess this was down to the airline rather than Skypicker.
5	After incorrectly entering DOB on a booking the team at Kiwi (thanks Jakub), sorted it it out across a complex flight connection quickly and painlessly - thanks team
5	Had a small Live chat help regarding some queries with Mayyas. She was really helpful in providing relevant information.
5	Very good them give me a better solution for my flight the airlines change the hours of the flight but <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> get a solution very thanks
3	So far so good. Just chatted with Eleonora today to change our check in from airport check in to online check in which was accommodated. No issues here. I have to wait and see when we get to fly from Coolangatta to Singapore, then Manila. Keeping our fingers crossed! Thanks Eleonora! Wonderful to chat with you
4	"Everything worked very well. The whole process was simple, I just had to give the information required. The boarding pass was provided very soon.A better service would be provided if I have also received the electronic boarding pass for ""passbook"" app. It would have avoided the printing of boarding pass."
5	Great customer service who helped me sort out my booking fast! Thank you :)
5	A HUGE  thanks to Kristyna and Martin!I was denied boarding in Colombo for my flight to Oman by the airline, due to a ridiculous policy. The airline just completely ignored me and told me to buy a new ticket. As I didn't have any call time (after trying to call the airline) , I used the 24/7 chat to get immediate assistance. Kristyna guaranteed me that I would get to Muscat today, called Oman Air and did the best she could to get me on that flight. Even though it was too late and her shift had finished, she passed on my issue to her colleagues who rebooked me on another flight to Muscat later that evening as the Kiwi team didn't want me flying with this airline!I then contacted Martin who followed up my tickets and has sent them to me so I can now fly!You do pay a bit higher for Kiwi, but this is inexpensive compared to the battle of buying a new ticket with a difficult airline.A huge thankyou. As a fellow travel industry employee, this is a perfect example of great teamwork and customer care.Would highly recommend to anyone!
4	Very good customers service, very polite and helpfull. I made a mistake with my name and they were able to fix it, without paying smth extra, even in the begining one from kiwi said that I have to pay a fee. When I was stressed because of the situation, Aliaksandra and Sabina helped me most talking very respectful and empathic, and they were open to talk to wizz air again, managing to change the name without paying smth extra.  A thing I was not so staisfied with was that I was expecting the other boarding card at a certain date and I did not receive it in my email. But when contacting the customers service, Filip fixed it quick.Thank you.
5	No worries about changing schedules and receiving planty option and information for a better choice. Total support and really quick answers.
5	non potendo fare il checkin direttamente su ryanair ho chiesto informazioni tramite live chat, fantastico!!! grazie a Pavel abbiamo risolto tutto (anche se il sistema aveva già fatto tutto) velocemente poco prima di partire!
5	I too like most people got a ticket through Skypicker from a third party website. I was worried once I had seen all the reviews and genuinely concerned about whether this was an actual flight ticket. In any case, my flight plans had changed drastically. I called into the hotline and was assisted by Barbora Uhlirova. She heard my issue, and summarized my issue in 30 seconds and told me to give her 24 hours to action my problem. I got a call back in an hour with my problem being solved. And followed up with an email to confirm and close the problem. @skypicker - you have a great employee here! Thanks for the help!
5	Very helpful when searching for good travels! Very good Skypicker!
1	Bait and switch. Lists one price, takes money in minutes, and then hours later after booking all connecting flights, hotels, and attractions I get an email saying the price went up over $200 USD. Then it takes 10 days for a refund, in which sits in their interest bearing accounts.
5	I booked several times with Kiwi and I was always very satisfied! Recommend!
5	Staff were most helpful: helped by Tomas
5	kiwi employees exeptional helping in my trip to venice Madrid and Asturiasmarie ,eleonora and lucie  were nice and patient with me in my problems withthe reservations to them thanks a lotI will use the company again and advise about your good services to my friendsthanks  margarita Garcia vianello
5	Few hours before my flight I checked in online at Swiss air and saw on my boarding pass that there are no checked in luggage even though I ordered it through Skypicker. I spoke to skypicker through the online chat and they called Swiss air on my behalf to confirm that my checked in luggage is ordered!
5	I needed to change a misspelled name and find out about baggage policy regarding my flights. Service was quick excellent, thanks Rodon and Lucie :)
4	I was hesitant at first because the fares are kinda cheaper than I expected, but come the departure date, everything went smoothly. The boarding passes are forwarded on time, and I'm sure I got the best airfare deals.
5	Nina, Miraslov, Zita, and Jiri were all extremely helpful when a string of delays left me stranded twice. They booked me next day flights at no extra charge to me and were very easy to deal with. Thank you all again.
5	Thanks again to Katerina G. that helped me for my bookings and was really nice and efficient.
5	Thank you Pupurt Cibro for your help today it really put me at ease as I was so worried that my son wouldn't get on his flight but all is well thanks to you again PupurtKate Deary
5	Customer support was awesome :D i haven't done my trip yet and they answered all my insecurities :D
1	I am going for a surftrip to Fuerteventura and the price for the flight was the cheapest. It wasn't possible to manage bookings on extra sport baggage before the flight was booked. Afterwards we found the crazy high fees which means it will not be possible for me to bring my surfboard bag. Surf trip ruined and will definitely find another airway company next year.
5	Our flight was delayed, so we could not achieve our connection flight. Kiwi support was readily accessible and found a solution in every way satisfactory.
5	if you are looking for a quick and painless service that works to satisfy every client and to fulfill everyone's individual needs, <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> is highly recommendableI had bought a plain ticket where i had missed an important detail that could cost me a lot of money but i had the pleasure to talk to travel consultant Bogdan C.Bogdan helped me solve the problem without any complications or fees and worked towards assuring me and my family a great vacation instead of assuring more money in their pockets
5	Katrin was extremely helpful in managing my reservations. She was quite knowledgeable and very efficient!!! Thank you for making my KIwi experience a good one.
5	Naomi was very proffesional and friendly help on chat. I need one large cabin bag and she checked me availibility in the moment and give me the price. Very well experience :) (I dont know if reference number is all right)

5	I Love Skypicker; they always find the best prices available online. Besides that, the customer service is Excellent!! thanks a lot Miquel. You were really helpful ;)
5	Great service by James.
5	Called twice and had great exper I necessary both times.  Today I spoke with Jonathan and he put me on hold to straighten out some things with the airlines.  He was very helpful and did everything he could to resolve the issue.  G I t my boarding passes as he held on the line to make sure I received it.  I'll use them again for next travel, for sure!
1	I had booked a flight Newcastle to Dubrovnik via Barcelona. This was done several months in advance the airline vuling then changed the connection to an earlier flight time over 2 months before I was due to travel. Skypicker didn't notice this issue or communicate anything to me until I contacted them when i was airside in Newcastle waiting to board. I contacted them via the web chat service and after almost 20 minutes no more information. I then boarded my flight. I arrived at the transfer destination to an email from the company stating that the flight had changed and they proposed another route Barcelona to Rome to Dubrovnik. This involved a 1 o'clock in the morning arrival in Rome and a 7 am departure. I requested that they provide somewhere to stay the night. I rang approximately 5 times in Barcelona with no clear answer. I then spoke to a very friendly and excellent customer service rep who informed me I would be entitled to 50 euro towards any Accomodation. This is not much as the airport hotel was 200 euro and the one I eventually stayed in was 100 euro plus a 25 euro taxi each way. Shortly after booking and the hotel taking payment I received an email from sky picker saying that they would not cover any costs as I had booked to early. As a result I am out 150 euro, 16 hours and I missed the start of my holiday all because of their inability to check what they are selling. I fly very often 30 times this year so far and never had such bad service from any provider! Do not use! Use their software to identify flights and then book through the airlines own sites.
4	The live chat is helpful, I got a help from Helen as an agent
5	I received great support at online chat. Patrik helped me with choosing the best insurence for me. Hopefuly my trip will go as smooth as this customer service.
5	BIG Thanks to their customer service ! for some reason i can not reach them via phone but tried via this fb page, they immediately called me back and solved my issue in my native language. Their employee was a kind and helpfull guy, his name was Lukas. Thanks !
2	A startup that finds discount flight tickets 'hidden' on airline websites just launched in the US <https://t.co/5Xq5kpc4Ap> johnangel1977
5	Lenka just helped my with our flight schedule which had been changed and she assured me to take care og sending me new etickets. Great help!
5	I spoke to Jonathan and he was so helpful and quick to resolve the problem which I was facing in IndiaGreat service
5	HiAfter you have purchased a ticket, but have not yet found boarding card, I tried to contact you via chat, but I did not understand very well. And Aholt call back to the phone mobile and the response to my call Brother Youssef latter who explain things to convince me well, which helped me to methodological understanding carried on by Kiwi companies for their customers, it is important from this thank you warmly, brother youssef on a helping hand dismantling formers and thank all the crew technical kiwi on good treatment your brother and your customer Mohammed Benamar
5	"Had issues regarding baggage weight etc and other information in regards to our multi-city flight. The online chat assistant ""Jan"" was quite helpful, pretty much provided all the information and answers to all the questions and beyond, insisting to help in several other complications which we didnt know. Overall great help, would definitely recommend.Also great prices :)"
4	I was extremely suprised about the very cheap fee to fly to ny. I fly often to ny which ususlly costs me a lot of money if i don t book 6month in advance.I never received a confirmation for my reservation what i realized 24h bevore my flight when i wanted to check in. The phone customer service was very fast and helpfull. I would have apprechiated a notification consering my luggage. Luckly i realized myselfe that i there was no luggae booked with my flights. So i called again and also this problem was handled fast and professional! And rather cheap 36€ for the luggage for both flights.So after reading alot of horrible references about norwegian i was to say the least very conserned to fliy to ny and expected the worst. But actualy it was a very good flight especially regarding the price!!!!!Just be prepared to receive NO food or drinks of you don t order it. I bought a lot of food in advance for my 18h trip and water as soon is i went trough security. Furthermore my 6.5h stop in copenhagen was a bit complicated since i had to check out completely (incl.luggage) and check in again, but for the price i paid a little inconvenance is absolutely ok! By the way the coprnhagen airport is awesom plus unlimides wifi!!! So time flew as well,)The flight copenhagen ny was with a dreamliner. Awesome airplain!!! LOVE IT! Only thing it was super full, but again in order to provide cheap flights i guess this has to be. And it s not like i never travelled in a full airplaim with a more expensive airline.... regarding the crew, well it s true they don t realy care about you. But since i got everthing with i didn t need anything from them so i didn t realy care...So overall i absolutely would use this service again but it s not yet my favourite airline.
1	A few hours after I purchased my ticket, I realized that I made an error in the reservation. I contacted Kiwi to see if they would be able to cancel or change the ticket since despite a confirmation email from Kiwi saying my purchase was confirmed, no tickets had actually been issued. After 2 days, Kiwi ignored my request to cancel the ticket before it was issued and had it issued anyway, then immediately sent me a response that since the ticket had been issued, I was subject to no cancellation rules from the airline.To make matters worse, what I hadn't realized until this set of interactions with customer service was that Kiwi is simply an overcharging middle man service. It is never made explicitly clear anywhere on their site or in your purchase what the actual cost of the ticket is, what their service charges are or the fact that they are not even affiliated with the airline.When I looked at the actual ticket from the airline, it turns out, the actual price of the ticket was 50% LESS than what was charged, and to add insult to injury, I am supposed to deal directly with the airline for any changes (which will cost half the ticket price to make).You are better off purchasing tickets directly from the airline.
5	I have to thank to my agent Saskia for her wonderfull job in assit me in a baggage issue, that was easily resolved by her.
5	Great
1	It is imposible to cancel all the flights that i booked? And get the money back?
5	Kostya was amazing at helping me manage my booking. Great customer service! However their systems could be better. I was given incorrect information about baggage allowance in my etickets which Kostya resolved for me after calling several airlines. Thank you
5	Excellent service and even though the airport closed and ordered everyone to leave and return the next day, I was able to quickly get the news that the airport reopened and get to airport in time for the revised flight schedule.  I have to give all the credit for Babak who persisted and ensured that I received the message.  Not only did he ensure that I got word, he left a voice message, emailed and followed up with a call several times and only because of his persistence did I get on the flight.  He went above and beyond and I greatly appreciate his efforts.  Sincerely Big thank you.
5	The customer service assistant, Miroslava was very helpful and it's been a great  pleasure dealing with her. Deserve a praise & a raise.
5	Very quick response for every question I had, very helpful and I'd like to mention HENRY GHARAGYOZAN who first answered me and guided me, this guy definitely deserves a beer from his boss:), but not forget NINA TURKIAN, YOUSSEF SOUINI, IRINA SELEZNEVA, AAMER TAGELDIN and ELENA SNEYKIS for a good team that shows to be. Thank them.This is before flying using their services and hope everything will be ok like they have shown me.
5	Excellent human service through chat. Specially so, under stressed situation as I was myself with no flights option to go back home. Thank you so much!!!
5	Representative Sara helped me a lot about changing my information at online check-in. Thank you for having her as you employee. :)
5	Great ticket price, great service.  Greg Londo was quick and fantastic and answered all my nervous last-minute boarding pass questions and sent my pass right to my inbox for me.  Thanks Skypicker!  This guy's awesome sauce!
5	I lost all my travel documents in an email crash - but with the friendly and skillfull help from the online chat agent Jan S. I had them all back within 4 min.Premium service!
2	I have used kiwi/skypicker a lot of times but this was the most awful experience ever.I booked a flight for my partner from LAX to Morocco (with 2 stops. One in Copenhagen and one in Brussels). At the booking stage kiwi suggested that he will need Visa for all the stops including Morocco. They say they are not responsible for any visa issues so of course i did my research.I checked with IATA and a the embassy and they confirmed that he will not need a Visa for Morocco, neither a visa for transiting Copenhagen or Brussel as he holds a permanent residence permit for USA.Now the fun part. At the Airport, Norwegian air declined his boarding, stating that he needs a Visa!!! (Again this was not the case). They said they have customers from kiwi with this issue at least twice a week and advise us to call Kiwi. We did so, and again we got the same reply, that we are responsible for the visa, and offer us an alternative flight, trough Paris, what the lady on the phone forgot to mention was that we will have to pay for it 2500€ (!!!). They insist that we were warned that he will need a visa when we booked the flight (we are going in rounds here). The other thing is that the warning was for every country including USA and Morocco for which he obviously didn't need a visa.After hours of calling i get a supervisor that was able to explain the issue. There is no transit zone between his flights. He would need to go through the border control each time, and this means he needs a schengen visa just to change the flight! I asked where is this information stated? He agreeed with me that nowere on the website it's stated that if the flights have a different PNR number that means you will leave the transit zone, how we were supposed to know about that? One of the girls from the support service said she agreed with me that this is an issue, and she will pass it to the technical team! But the company still refuses to accept that this problem is due to their lack of information on their website. If we knew about this we would have booked a flight via Istanbul without any hassel. We will get no refund for the lost flights, nor replacement.I'm seriously looking for a solicitor now.
5	We had forgot to check-in online (which has a 48 deadline), so we phoned up customer service desk if they could help us out. Phone call was answered immediately and Erik has helped us out by checking in online without any hesitation. Thanks for a great service!
5	Thank's Valentin , you've helped me a lot!
5	Skypicker gave me an excellent experience in buying my ticket.   I have tried to use Japanese sites to no avail, but Skypicker let me buy a Peach Air ticket with no trouble.
5	I spoke with Renata today regarding an name change error and she was so patient, helpful and went above and beyond for me. This is a very stressful time for me since I will be travelling soon and she assured me it would be changed. She made sure my e-mail was received and promptly forwarded it to the airlines so they could change my name on the e-ticket.Excellent Customer Service!Thank you Renata & Kiwi!
5	So great experience. Cheap, good service and everything worked smoothly. I wanted to change seats in some of the planes, called them and a day later they fixed it for me.Can't recommend this company enough!
5	I would like to say thank to Dorota and Markéta for their help with the change the date of birth on my ticket. I had been very lucky because they speak also in my language. It was really helpfull because my English is not the best and they solved that problem in a short time. Thank you girls one more time.
5	Very good customer support. You should expect answers almost immediately. Thanks Michaela for the help.
5	Many thanks to Kiwi. I booked a last minute flight and Kiwi offered me the best fares. I have to admit I was a little bit afraid as I hadn't heard of Kiwi before and did not really trust the website. But it all went extremely well and that was exactly what I was looking for. I had a connecting flight flying back to Paris but it was still the cheapest option and enabled me to have a wonderful holiday. So for people not trusting the website or not daring to try, I can only Recommend them to use it. Of course it's easy for me to say, as I did not experience any difficulty and I did not register any luggage. But is it not what I was looking for? A payment and flight without any problems? A great thanks to Adam J. who was really nice when I called Kiwi righty after booking to make sure the reservations had been confirmed by all airlines. He answered all my questions very precisely.
5	Every time I contacted customer service they were very helpful and patient, which I appreciated. My experience was a favorable one.
5	My husband and I were looking for information on meal options with our dietary restrictions and seating options. Helen Shostak, our skypicker travel consultant, got back to us right away with all the information for all of our booked flights.
5	I recently have been in Skypicker website and from Online Chat, Ms. Tatyana K. has been really helpful! I have been in really bad situation and her very positive attitude really helped me. We are in progress of solving my problem now and I am sure we will be able to sort it out very quickly with Ms. Tatyana's help!Thank you Skypicker!
5	Easy to use website, fast and accurate response to my enquirey overall a pleasant experience using Skypicker. I will use them again and recommend to my friends as well
5	I was worried because I was not receiving the boarding pass for some reason but Ulug'bek Z. from the live chat helped me out and I got them in no time. Thanks again for the help, that was really appreciated :)
5	Customer service excellent. Tomas rocked.
5	Very friendly and customer serviced. She solved my problems and answered my questions quickly!
5	I would like to congratulate Dominica and Joaocarreira from the call center customer service. I had a problem with a delayed flight, frustrated from the bad service of Frontier Airlines Dominica and Joaocarreira were so kind to help me find another flight faster than I thought. They went above and beyond to assist me.Thank you Kiwi for your great customer service.
5	Your service is did your job just right.Ticket were went to my email time in time.I like your registration service,everything was did without me
5	While Ryanair tried desperately to get a 45 euro fine for a late online check in, Kiwi helped us immediately to solve the issue and to get access to boarding pass.Thank you very much for you kind help and shame on Ryanair for treating costumers on their flights like that.
1	They cancelled my flight and said that the airline was at fault. Then I was emailing with them and then they stopped answering me. I thought it was a great site at first but they don't seem to care about a customer that was planning on using them for years to come
5	User friendly and modern website in addition to amazing 24/7 customer service.I really appreciate Lorena Gallo for her help and answering all my questions.
4	We went as a group, but used skypicker individually. I did some corrections through email and did not have any problems. My friend tried to do the same corrections over the phone and despite promise to do that on your end it was not done. Otherwise you service is very good.
5	Great service!!!and exceptional assistance thought online chat room,they answered all my questions fast and precise!!i feel very confident about my flight!!thank you!!!
2	It's just impossible to reach them by phone in any country
5	I needed help with adding a checked baggage to my international trip. The help was quick and just what I needed. thank you very much Jan Lukasek! (^_^)b
5	Very Professional and kind! Thanks to Luis Silva for helping us out with our check-in. Keep up the good work!
5	I like the professional way of the customer service .the response time was perfect.
5	I was accidentally double booked for a flight due to the site saying my credit card was denied.  I then tried again to purchase ticket and the same thing happened.  I checked my email and saw that both tickets went through.  I called Skypicker and was able to talk to Henry immediately and he confirmed with me that a request was made to cancel the 2nd booking and it should be refunded within 7-10 business days.  I am extremely impressed with how easy it was to talk to someone and then to have confirmation of the refund without any hassle.  Henry was great and very reassuring that the 2nd booking would be cancelled and refunded.  I will be sure to follow up with another review once I confirm the cancellation and refund.  Thank you so much, I am very impressed with the customer service and the ticket price was a great bargain.
5	Very good cooperation with Mrs. Sabina. Thanks a lot! I can 100% recommand this company :) Best wishes FP.
5	I want to compliment my agent with KIWI.  Ms. Tamera resolved a thorny problem I experienced where I needed to increase my checked in baggage from 15 kg to 20kg, had been sent a link [but could not access it because I was in the forest at a campground with spotty internet reception] and the link expired. She waded through all my correspondence patiently, efficiently and led me through the process of completing my transaction. She was very professional, friendly, helpful --and this was done through online chat rather than telephone! Thank you, Tamera.
5	I am delighted with my experience with Skypickers and am thrilled at how quickly and efficiently you have helped me.Thanks so much.Will defo use you again for a booking.
5	Thanks Aura.. Am happy that you changed our info without any fee
5	After making a mistake checking in to my flight, I used the online chat forum to speak with a representative. The agent who helped me was Michal and not only was he quick in helping me, but it was very easy to do. Thank you <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>!
5	I couldn´t figure out how to check in so I wrote to Sky Pickers chat. Jiří Červenka at Sky Picker helped me check in at nine o´clock in the evening on a Sunday - very helpful. Very good service.
5	I got some profesional and kind service from Lenardo. He gave good awnsers and help to all my questions. Thank you very much! Pontus
5	I was very pleased to comunicate with Olena, she was quick in chat and gave me right information about infant tickets and helped me with changing my booking. Thank you! Tomas
5	My special thanks to PETER and your company for the wonderful job you did for me and my girlfriend!
4	I got great help from a girl called Zuzaba S. She was fast and very helpful and could provide me the information that I needed.
5	I signed up for trip insurance for my upcoming flight to Scotland but, because I did not have a return date, the insurance could only apply to my one-way ticket, and so is only good for 15 days,though the trip  will be much longer. I spoke with Kiwi's agent, Ms. Mariya Portello, who could not have been more supportive or understanding. She analyzed the problem promptly but, unfortunately, the insurance must be attached to a specific return ticket date, which I do not have. Mariya consulted with the insurance company, double checked with her manager and, most importantly, kept me constantly informed. It was an impossible situation (my own lack of planning) and I am hopeful I will be able to acquire coverage through my own agent at home. No matter. What was most helpful to me was Mariya's support and attention. I hope I do not need any further problem-solving on this trip, but if I do, I am confident that I will get the help I need from Kiwi, and I hope that if I do have to call for help, Mariya will answer the phone.

1	Shocking service, seriously bad advice, a genuine bunch of incompetents. There are lots of agents out there, find one that is at least vaguely competent. These people are shysters who have changed their name recently, possibly to avoid lawsuits from disgruntled customers. Avoid at all costs, They are based in Czech which makes it very hard to bring a civil action against them.
5	great support, helped me out in short time.
5	You can find great fares, the Web is user friendly. First time I got a little anxious as of not receiving my boarding pass right away, but they gave it in the date promised and no problems at all.
5	Very long story short: My husband's flight from Gatwick to Vancouver on WestJet was cancelled. Kira of Kiwi got him onto an Air Canada flight instead. His phone was malfunctioning, so Kira called me (in Oregon, USA) and let me know what was happening, and she sent me an email with details. Excellent service, beyond what was required. Thank you, Kira.
4	I just booked a trip to Ibiza from Melbourne for the best price and the best service ever! I was nervous about the booking I spoke to Natalia Zelinska on phone and she was an absolute super star!!!!
5	I had a great time using SKYPICKER ! I definitely recommend ! And a really by thank to my savior Grzegorz !
5	Great support from Stan I had a mix-up with my passport details and was unable to check in online before my flight. Contacted kiwi support over chat and the problem was sorted out promptly. In less than 10 mins I was checked into my flight and had my boarding passes emailed. Excellent service, I was super impressed!
5	I had some questions regarding the check-in procedures at different Airline Companies. I contacted Kiwi on chat and Mr. Jan Lukasek was very helpful. He helped me with the check-in for my return flight, and he gave me all the relevant information that I needed, so thank you for that.And it was nice, that there was no waiting time. Mr. Jan Lukasek entered the chat almost instantly.
1	I booked flight ticket from kiwi. By mistake i wrote wrong surname, but on the same day I put request to change the surname but they denied and even saying that my money is nonrefundable.
5	Had a great chat after stupid me entered the wrong email address. Alaa was a fantastic support. Sorted it out within a couple of minutes. Thanks for that buddy
5	I want to thank Ms Zuzana hruskava for amazing customer support. I talked with her one hour ago and I am very satisfied. She managed to fix my issue with flight change and it was really fast!
5	Kristyna N. informed me in detail and clearly  about the baggage allowance increase I had requested, and even went beyond my expectations, and provided me with better options, to the ones I had suggested by myself.Thank you Keywan
1	I booked a connecting flight via <http://Kayak.co.uk|Kayak.co.uk> (I do regular bookings with them) for my mothers-in-law and I was redirected to this so called company's website; they  book the ticket exactly how a normal person would be doing it! Not like a travel agent! Now I have to exit in Milan Airport and collect my luggage and than check in again to fly to Manchester.Now they don't give me the booking reference number for Ryanair.... called 5 times but no joy...I really was deceived JUST STAY AWAY
5	I like to thank Anitha for qick changing of the wrong name in my booking.
5	A very helpful chat. I talked to Tomas who helped me ASAP. Thank you.
5	God service!!!
5	I express my gratitude to the travel -Cognsultant <http://QIWI.com|QIWI.com>  Olga Shevchenko for the timely and professional assistance in oforlenii booking. V Kuznetsov.
5	Only by not having to visit the site, would make it easier...
4	Called because of a change in email adresses, and Juan Costa helped me alot. Thank you so much for the help.
5	used your help serviceneeded airline confirmation numberyour agent (Julia) was helpfulShe filled ID number and expire on my behalf and hopefully will get my boarding pass
3	@skypickercom Extra for service. My foot !  In case i don't want your service you don't provide the booking info which you call credentials.
5	I used Skypicker for the first time and they really took any hassle out of the process. They even organised the online check in, which is something I would nearly always forget or leave to the last minute.They have it all - great prices and great service!!
5	Wow! What efficiency. Easy help with Miroslav on chat. Excellent company, will use from now on.
1	I wrote a review of this company before I took the flight. At that time I also rated them as a one because of their poor customer care, and lack of knowledge from customer service. They couldn't even understand how to allocate seats and different representatives quoted me different prices. It was all very sketchy. With this company, I have now missed my entire flight because the airline did not inform me of proper documentation needed for a layover. Any respectable airline would alert a guest if a visa was needed for a layover but because this company is cheap, you also receive the worst treatment possible. They do not take responsibility for their guests and are very unethical as a company all around. I am now stuck in Malaysia, no one will from the company will help me, I have to buy completely new tickets and on short notice it will cost me hundreds of dollars to replace. So now instead of a cheap or even decent ticket, I will be paying way more than if I would have booked with a respectable, responsible airline. This company may provide cheap tickets for travel but If you encounter any hiccups along the way, you will be completely on your own. I would advise anyone to stay away from this company.
5	I had Catalina as my representative, she was very responsive and helpful and solved my problem instantly.... Great quality of customer service from catalina.... Thank you
5	i appreciate the follow up of the crew of <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> site through chat specially mr. Stanislavthey helped my correct fatal mistakes in my flights info
1	My flight was cancelled by the airline more than 1 month prior to its departure. Only after arriving at the airport did I find this out from the airline. After speaking with the airline employee, he showed me in his booking system that on 5 different occasions, they contacted Skypicker and let them know of the cancellation, but not once did Skypicker notify me of the cancellation. I tried to contact Skypicker via live chat. I did not receive any response for more than 2 hours, at which point there were no other rerouting options available. On 5 different occasions I was told this error was due to an email server upgrade at Skypicker. Each time they admitted their wrong doing, but have yet to live up to their service commitment. I was promised on a limited refund for our cancelled trip. To add insult to injury, Skypicker claims that I broke their service terms and conditions because during the 2 hours I was unable to connect with them, I spoke to other airlines seeking an alternate route, Skypicker refused to refund a large portion of my rebooking costs because they unavailable agent didn't offer it to me before I made the rebooking. This company's communication with me has been an absolute joke. They have repeated lost my emails and have made multiple promises to get back to me within a certain time frame. Only after I contacted them over and over did they finally respond to my inquiries. It has been more than 2 weeks since this incident and I have yet to see a single penny returned to my account. Stay away from this company at all costs!
3	I just had a chat with Martin Carter. Great professional. Very Fast and kind.He fixed an issue on the email address in a faction of a second....However I just realized that the price that I paid  is much higher that the one offered by the same carriers for the same journey... next time I will think twice before using KIWI!
5	I made a mistake while booking. I was helped by Lukas who solved my mistake quickly and smoothly. Amazing support. I will be a life time user of <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com>.Thank you Lukas.
5	Booked flights several months in advance for 7 of us travelling from Toronto to Hawaii. The price was the best at that time and I must admit I was a little nervous up until we checked-in. We travelled over the Christmas holiday so the airports were hectic. Thankfully all went well!<http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> sent reminder messages and I was delighted to get an email from them just before returning home. They had pre-selected our seats which saved us time to enjoy the end of the vacation. All flights and connections went without any difficulty. We were travelling with elderly family members and they ensured porters were waiting to help with transfers. Definitely will refer to their website first when booking flights!
4	Excellent service...!Due to Chennai floods, chennai airport got closed and all the flights got cancelled. Airlines refused to provide the alternate ways, but skypicker team immediately provided the best ways to travel to my destination with free of cost.I am very much happy about the service and my special thanks to Aamer Tageldin (Skypicker team member)  assisted me till the end.
5	I booked some tickets through them and made a mistake. Through the chat it was very easily changed. Contact was pretty fast and they are very helpful.
5	I am really really appreciated of Michal's help. When I need very urgent change service of flight date, Michal gave me very rapid and kind support. I could deal with my work more easily thanks to him. This is not jut for flattery or cheating.I hope that Michal could take good evaluation in his company(maybe the member of customer support department). Every good man can do their work well but the person with sincerely can give comport and satisfaction to their customer. I felt he is sincere person.Thanks.
5	I just want to give a huge thank you to Viktor! for helping me with my flight! I was stressing out and he helped me and completely took the stress away! Awesome customer service and really good communication!
5	Thanks Skypicker team for giving a good service and responsibility to the customers. In my case especially thanks to Anas Dallal that stayed one hour extra at work to solve my problem as he promised. Cheers :))))))
5	I have not yet taken my trip to Europe (tickets bought obviously though skypicker!) BUT i just wanted to say THANK YOU so much to Joao Carreira who gave me personal experienced tips to getting through different airlines and different cities!!! HUGE help!!! Thank you :)
5	I've booked quite a few different of complicated flights and Kiwi and their reps have ever let me down. I've always had fantastic, accurate and speedy service through themy :) also want to give a out out to Theodore the representative I spoke with who happened to be greek as well haha x) made my day. Thank you guys!!
5	Vojta M was helping with my check in quick and profesional. Thank you
5	fast and efficient
5	Booked a flight with Kiwi, didn't add baggage until I decided I needed some at the last second which would otherwise be impossible. However, I came into contact with one of their online agents, Renata, an amazing employee helped me out and made the arrangements for me. Was that a life saver? Oh yes. Great job. 5*
5	I've commited a mistake on the date of my return flight and the personnel managed the situation within 1 hour after my call. Thank you very much!
1	Skypicker was shocking!Online check in wasn't allowed prior to flight as SkyPicker failed to send the correct emails. We then had to pay an additional £45 to check in.  Awful service, terrible customer support.Never using again!
5	Best experience ever via online chat customer service.Very helpful and informative feedback. RECOMMENDED
5	I was having a problem with my booking and Adam Jelinek sorted out very fast and kind.
5	your customer service is great , than you alot oga for helping me , and solving my problem .
5	Excellent service, highly recommended for good prices and troubleshooting with any situation.
5	I think that Skypicker is one of the best site to book your flights with;I found lowest prices on this site, and a very easy way to book them.Skypicker does everything in your place, you just have to provide your passport informations and they even do online check-in and send you your boardind pass as soon as available.As I said first, it's very easy =)
5	Easy, fast, cheap!
4	First time trying kiwi, although my flight got canceled (airline's fault) kiwi was prompt to find me a replacement that would suit my needs. Customer service people where nice and helpful via email and via chat. Also when I considered changing part of my flight Dorota helped me look for potential alternatives.
5	Abigail was a really kind and helpful person. Quick response and to the point. Give her a raise.
5	Kiwi is the first website I have found to have a live chat with their agents who can help 24/7. This has been the greatest help ever from confirming my reservation, to adding my luggage and then asking for a reimbursement I needed. The team is very kind and patient and helps you immediately to find a solutions with your doubts.
5	Aliz did a great job and was fantastic to work with.As for <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> they were good as well.  A flight delay caused me to miss my connection and they helped me buy another ticket.
5	Thank you Yulia K, being very helpful for helping me booking multiple flight and the main thing is saving my pocket
5	I put in the expiry incorrectly on the for and went straight on to the live chat with Emre T who sorted it with 2 minutes, no problem :-)
3	Firstly, I would like to compliment Mary P, who was the first point of contact via the international phone call that we have made when we missed the connecting flight. It is due to the flight delay from our previous flight from Puerto Princesa to Manila. She has the patience and empathy to empathize with our dire situation we are in. I would also like to thank her for being able to solve the problem at the 3rd phone call and get us onto the earliest next flight from Manila to Singapore. If it weren't for her, we would be stranded in the airport for a longer duration.That being said, we are also very disappointed and appalled at the HORRIBLE experience we had with the 2nd customer service agent (I did not managed to get the name). We made a 2nd call as we did not receive any callback after the 1st phone call. I have to waste another 5-10 min explaining my dire situation to her which I did not receive any empathy and was even rude towards us. It did not help especially when the investigation was not properly investigated as the flight was delayed for more than 2 hrs instead of just 5 min as claimed on the website. I WOULD NOT have made the international calls if it was only a 5 min delay with exorbitant phone bills at the end of the day and receiving such lousy services from the 2nd customer service agent.Please do refer to the original Flight timing for our flight with Cebu Pacific (5J640) below:1730 hrs departure from Puerto Princesa, 1850 hrs arrival at Manila.After the delay:1840 hrs departure from Puerto Princesa, 2030 hrs arrival at ManilaThe connecting flight was at 2100 hrs. Please do note that if we had landed as per the original timing, we would have ample time to catch our flight instead of spending time and money as well as effort to keep explaining to the customer service agents. The 2nd operator i spoke to totally not interested to listen and understand our plight but rather, trying to dismiss us. This is seriously bad customer service. I have already told her that i'm calling via international phone call and it is costly and we are desperate for help. She insisted that we are the one at fault as Cebu Airlines claims to be delayed for 5 mins and we should have landed on 1855 hrs and would still have been able to catch our connecting flight.  Not investigating properly and to pin-point that we are at fault ? Why would we be lying in the first place?After near another 5-10mins trying to resonate with her, she had the audacity to raise her voice, telling me someone will be calling me to follow up on the case. THIS IS DEFINITELY A BIG NO-NO  for a customer service operator. Being a customer service associate myself, I am indeed disappointed and frustrated with such treatment as we should always TRY to understand instead of RAISING our voices.All in all, this whole entire episode has caused me and my friends distress and anxiety not to mention the frustrations we had trying to get back to our country. It had also dampen the mood at the end of the holidays. It was only after Mary P. had called us back and got us on the available earliest flight that the rating was a 3 instead of 1.Lastly, Please action on the following:1) Investigate properly with Cebu pacific on the ACTUAL DURATION OF DELAY and an apology from the 2nd phone call operator. I believe we are not the only passengers ON THE SAME FLIGHT.2) Explain why I have to repeat my situation 3 times when it should have been recorded on the 1st phone call.3) Reimburse my phone bill for the international calls made. If you are not able to refund me, please do escalate to higher management. I will continue to pursue the matter until the refund is given.I expect a full refund of my phone bill and a satisfactory answer.Thank you.RegardsNicholas Tay Zhi YuanLim Ming ShiangLim Ming Swin
5	Just spoke with Ivana from <http://skypicker.com|skypicker.com> she was most helpful, very polite, spoke english very well and fix my issues with easy. A joy to deal with
5	I really like to do my booking on <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>. They give you so many new opions including low cost airlines. Also many thanks to Aura for additional support ans service. I needed to change the invoice, seat and food.Thanks a lot !!!
5	Very kind and helpful with all information needed. Thank you
5	was an awsome service specially when someone like Jan answers all the questions and is ahead of the game, thanks alot. The chat service is  awesome, swift and effective a great experience .
5	In a few seconds Filip of <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> fixed a my mistake in a reservation. Thank you so much Filip!!!
5	Had to cancel a booking so went on live chat and was assisted by Kristýna R. The cancellation was sorted rapidly and in a pleasant manner. Very positive experience and I will be booking through <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> again and this time with the correct date!
1	"I bought tickets on skypicker/kiwi.com and on the day of the flight they didn't even notify me that the flight had been preponed. I had to spend the entire day on the phone with them and even missed a college exam. The guy couldn't even search for a new flight on his own so I had to suggest some myself. It was so ridiculous. They were always telling me ""I'll search for a new flight and call you in 10 minutes"", and never called. I had to be checking up on them all day and of course I received a 100€ phone bill. This is the most ridiculous agency.The result was a flight that I couldn't use so almost 700€ lost because of their inefficient work. Please, just look for different ones or buy tickets directly from the company. This agency is a joke."
5	Hi this is the first time i have used your service to book a flight. I had some difficulties with the booking and hoped online to chat with a support person. His name was Michal and he was fantastic he worked through the issues thoroughly with me and helped me solve the problem as quickly as possible. I was very happy with his service
1	I mistakenly and unware bought my tickets from <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> while I found my flights on <http://kayak.com|kayak.com>, completely unsolicited. This had never happened with kayak before. Also, you are better off buying directly from the airline as I found the same ticket for 78% of what I paid with <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com>.I find it completely unacceptable that after I've paid for my ticket I wanted to confirm my reservation at the airlines website and I was not allowed to do so. Then I was told that I could not check-in myself. The options were give <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> all my personal information or pay 280GBP at the airport. This conditions should be made explicitly clear before the purchase. Never again!
1	Thought I got a deal on a flight with a layover..so I booked the one with a layover.. would have paid more for no layover as the international flight I booked with kiwi didn't include baggage (which I didn't know). Cost an extra $140 for baggage. Warn customers you don't include baggage costs before they book.. won't do business again with you.
5	I got the help I needed! Very good service. It did not take long time!
5	Had some questions about my reservation and I called just to dobbel check if everything was correct not really expecting that it actually would be possible to contact them this late. But thankfully a very nice gentleman was there to pick up my call and help out with my questions and helped out with everything.Very pleased with the service and thought it was worth to give a positive review back as a thanks for the help!
5	After my flight operated by Air France booked off another website got cancelled caused by the unnecessary strike, I was looking on kiwi for an alternative. I was successful and after contacting the call center everything was good. The stuff is really nice and understanding and takes time for you. Thanks to Dominika my vacation is saved and I will be able to see my boyfriend after 8 months again. Thank you Dominika and kiwi. We will definitely use your service again.
5	Everything was great. They built the flight very well, no problems. Everything went as expected without trouble. I recommend it
5	After missing the deadline on entering my passport details I phoned Mr Tomáš Mužík and he sorted out the problem quickly and very efficiently. I'm very impressed :) Thank you!
4	I was promised to have my boarding pass for my first flight from BNE to DPS on 23rd December 2015. However in the next morning, I didn't receive anything in the email (my flight was in the evening of 24th December 2015). I went straight to the website and using the live chat, I was served by Emre T who helped me sort it through. About 40 minutes from the first chat I got my boarding pass in the email. He helped me all the way and was making sure that everything is fine. Quick reply and excellent service, would recommend to everyone that I know.
5	I would like to thank LENKA operator! I really liked it, as a specialist treated my problem, how well the support was provided. This demonstrates the high level of professionalism and ability to work with people. Thank you, LENKA!
5	I called the helpline over confusion with my luggage. Although the airline offered free luggage my online booking didnt show this. I also had to add baggage for one airline on my trip. The consultant Eva Prochazkova was so helpful and answered my query.  She went above and beyond to contact my airline which eventually got me a cheaper price. She called back when she said she would and I was happy with the result. Overall great customer service from Eva, thanks for sorting my problem, especially on new years eve!
1	"After making a booking and payment, I received an email requesting me to verify the payment by calling to their phone number. I called five times and I was holding on the call for over an hour in total not being answered by a human!! I lost my booking as well I had to cancel my hotel reservation because not being able to receive my tickets. I am extremely dissapointed with <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com>, Why do they request me to verify the payment by calling to a phone number which THEY DO NOT ANSWER? Payment verification is done by the bank anti-fraud system not by the end company, which do not have any means to do this, this is just the bullshi.t they say because <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> blocks your money and ""confirms"" your booking BEFORE THEY HAVE ACTUALLY MADE THE RESERVATION with the airline. This is nearly a scam, I AM NEVER AGAIN BOOKING TROUGH <http://KIWI.COM|KIWI.COM>"
4	Issis (I can't remember her last name :( ) was really kind and helpful. I needed to get my boarding pass and in couple of minutes it was done. Thank you Issis!
5	I was very impressed with the thoroughness and kindness of the customer service representative I was assigned (thank you Filip). His attention to my grievances helped make the process of purchasing a flight ticket very easy. Thanks again Filip!
5	Dear Lenka Havlickova,I would like to thank you and your company for guiding me on how can I solve my situation in my baggage on my up coming flight....Keep up the good customer service.....:+1::skin-tone-2::+1::skin-tone-2::+1::skin-tone-2:Thanks & Godbless,Joeisha
5	I had to get back from turkey in a hurry, family illness. There were no direct flights to Edinburgh so I shopped around, Other company's were quoting 2 flights and very expensive with a long stop over. I tried Kiwi for the first time. Kiwi found me 3 flights much cheaper and I was home quicker than my other option. Kiwi even checked me in to all my flights.I would definitely try Kıwi first next time.Andy H
5	Great customer care! I had a problem resolved within minutes :)
5	I received a really quick and clear response after having questions concerning my boarding pass.
5	I needed to book an urgent domestic flight while I was abroad and the service I received from skypicker was absolutely amazing not only the price was better than the competitors the booking experience was simple and easy, I would bookmark and use again.
5	I've used <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> many times, I always find it very convenient that they do on-line check in for you, you receive the boarding pass in your mailbox without bothering to check it in yourself (I am not sure if this apples to all the flights, at least it was the case for my domestic flights in Australia), today I accidentally booked a ticket on the wrong date, I immediately contacted the customer survive (life chat), the customer service (Katarina) was really helpful, she canceled my booking right away so i can proceed the booking on the right date, go home and see my family. It was basically my own fault and they didn't have to deal with it, yet they did. I really appreciated that, I will continue using <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> and definitely recommend it to my friends.
5	I was initially nervous booking with Kiwi, but I am so very glad that I did. When our first flight was delayed by over 4 hours (causing us to miss our connecting flight home), Kiwi's representatives Babak and Katerina went above and beyond to find us alternative travel home. It was comforting to know that someone was taking care of us during an anxious time, in a foreign airport, thousands of miles from home. On top of this, we didn't have to pay any additional fees for the flight changes, and since our updated travel meant an overnight layover, Kiwi is also reimbursing us for our hotel accommodations for that evening. I will definitely be using Kiwi in the future.
5	Quick response time and very helpful support agent!
5	I have had a problem with booking the flight. Through an online chat when I communicated with Aura, I could not only resolve my problem but had a pleasant time while doing it. Thanks Aura:)
4	Thanks Igor Guzvinec for the patience, helpfulness and clarifications!
5	I used Skypicker to book a trip to Las Vegas and was a little dubious at first because we changed twice and had to check in separately for each flight, there was also only an hour between the last two flights, but Skypicker assured me this would be fine when I rang them. It was, I received our boarding cards for the first flight with Ryanair before we left and both of the other flights were with Delta Airlines so we could check in for them both at the same time at the first change, the whole thing was painless and there were no problems. I was also concerned when I made the booking that I didn't have everyone's passport details but was still allowed to book by putting in false details and changing them once I'd collected them from the other travellers, that wasn't a problem I rang up with the details and had no issues at the airports at all. The only problem was that we were limited to using just hand luggage because we would have been charged for the luggage to go in the hold for each flight and over the return journey that would have been 6 flights and around £140 per person, we used hand luggage and to be honest I usually do so I was fine with this but some of our party were concerned, however, they realised that you can actually have quite a big case as a hand luggage and didn't have any problems fitting it all in. Overall we saved around £180 with them for the booking per person and we were all very pleased with the experience, one of the people in our party is booking up to go to New York soon and is going to use Skypicker again. They were very professional and friendly and when I had a query that the agent wasn't sure of she even rang me back, which is what she said she would do but that doesn't happen with many companies these days.
5	Tanks for all the help I recive during my booking,so far all the problems are resolve,special tanks forTomas Krivanek for all the help he provide for a sussefull booking.RegardsJose.
4	I was plesantly surprised by Michal wich not only did everything to answer my questions but made the discution very friendly and empathic. Praise for his work.
5	They are great they answered my question directly thanks to helping me  Babak  !
4	Fast and friendly service, with responsive support staff.
1	It sucks that they'll take my money and they confirm the flight but after few hours they send an email where they tell me that they'll return the money coz the original flight is cancelled and I should book a new flight and  then after I book the second flight  two hours later they tell me that one was over booked so my tickets gets cancelled again.... So annoying that they do  like this. How they are not checking if there is room on the flight before they charge...And now they aren't even returning all my money which I paid for both of the tickets. Last time I'm using that site.
5	Great service from Enri A.! Good and easily understood answers. I can recommend everybody to write to him if you have any questions!Good day!
5	@skypickercom loving it! Now have 5 hours in #Warsaw on the way home to #Athens with @ContentTravel @TCSmultimedia #travelmassive
5	i would like to thank Naomi Osei Poku from <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> for attending my issue with the reservation i made to amsterdam.she is pleasent to chat with , and compreensive.thanks eran
5	Incredible service! I had a very complicated problem and Viktor, very patiently and kindly, made sure to help solve it. Thank you !!!
5	We had to fly from Hamburg to Dusseldorf to Riga and our flight from Hamburg to Dusseldorf was cancelled. With the help of Kiwi operator who was very polite and helpful we managed to change tickets and to go from Hamburg to Munich ant than to Riga, only 1 hour later than planned before.Big thanks to Kiwi operator Andrea C. from Italy!

5	Easiest flight booking ever, where relevant boarding passes were sent and everything was very clear. Round the world trip with some great flights, awesome value, and the confidence to know whatever airport you rocked up to next you were on the flight, had the correct information and everything was smooth. Thank you Lukas Janecka I've already recommended the booking service to everybody that I have met along the way. Great work, Nicola
5	I found my use of the live chat helper very useful and found Emre T to be very helpful and efficient. Thanks again Emre T.
5	Skypicker gave me 2 connecting flights for a considerably low price. They really saved me a lot of time, money and hassle. I wish I knew about them sooner.
5	I was having some problems with checking in online because I had forgotten to fill them in myself. Even though it was my mistake, the live chat agent, Jan, was extremely helpful and did her job quickly and efficiently. She was very polite and it really made me feel less troubled by my problems. Although Kiwi provides solutions for cheap flights, I felt like I had first class customer service. This really made my day!
5	P. Burian, J. Zdechovana, K. Starostecka were very polite and helpful. Thank you for your excellent customer service!
4	I booked a flight from Nice to LA bout a week ago, and had to stop in Brussels (for a night) and Cancun (for 3 hours). While arriving in Brussels I noticed my flight to Cancun was delayed for 3 hours, I was sure to miss my other flight to LA.I directly sent a message on Facebook to find a solution at this problem, the answer was so fast, just an hour. As it wasn't my fault, they booked me another flight  from Cancun to LA for the day after while asking me if the date and hours were ok to me, and paid me an hotel up to 50euros. In 2 hours everything was done.Thanks again for what they done!I recommend this website because the flights are so cheap. And the customer service on Facebook, even on Christmas day (when I contacted them), is the best ever (I wasn't in my country so I had to contact them only via Facebook).The only bad point I gotta say is that you never know which terminal you gotta leave or arrive. But you just have to check on the airport website before.
5	My son was stuck in a european airport in his way back home from Canada since one of his connection flights was late. I contacted Kiwi support line and spoke to a number of agents and all of them were very kind and they rescheduled him on another flight which was reasonable.My phone calls was answered very quickly without long waiting or delays.I recommend to make your next reservation with <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>
5	This is my first time using <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> and at first I have doubt about them. I'm worry that I will have some issues with my booking since the way work very different but after contacting their service team, I feel so secure.Eric is the guy who answered my questions and give me a quick and pretty straight forward answer which I really like!Thanks Kiwi
4	Everything went well. My ticket flight's price was way too much cheaper than buying in normal flight website. It is just that they didn't inform me I need to check in myself if I didn't get my boarding pass on time. I was quite panicked, but I called their landline. Even it took a while, but someone did pick up my call and answer all questions I need.
5	I deal with airline booking companies all day as part of my job. I had never heard of Kiwi and found myself dealing with them one day and was very wary - but to my surprise they did an incredible job helping me get a $1000 refund on some flights where the airline had a no refund policy. Usually these big booking companies just say sorry there is nothing we can do - but not these guys - they stuck with it and came through. Awesome. Thank you.
5	I've used kiwi a couple of times. Would not hesitate to use it again.
5	Mario Zarsky was very helpful in finding options to fly from Sarajevo to Madrid, since my trip was changed because of the airline.Thank very much.I always going to use Kiwi for my trips.
5	thank you <http://kimi.com|kimi.com> Catalina helps me a lot to solve my problem. She answers all my questions regarding my  reservation .

5	Thanks Aura, great service.
5	Very good price-quality balance. Had to get a long haul ticket in a hurry and was looking for the best price. The whole booking process was easy and fast, very nice!
5	Great service in the livechat from Bek, 5/5
5	I had a problem with the change of the name in my ticket.He was very helpful and polite.He helped me a lot and we solved the problem.He took the matter and tried to solved it.
3	Hello maam/sir.... Can i ask regarding my ticket that my employer got from skypicker? thanks...hope you can help me about my concern with my ticket. Thanks
5	Even though, there was a problem with my booking confirmation, Lukas Janecka could not have done a better job. Thus I am naming him as the Best Trustpilot who followed me through a step by step procedure so that my booking follows through. 5+ service
5	I had an unfortunate event where I was moved from one flight to another due to over booking and then the new flight I was meant to take left because the captain didn't want to wait for more passengers. As a result I would be missing my connecting flight which was booked through another airline. I tried to explain my situation at the airport but no-one was assisting me. I then called Kiwi who I booked my original travel trip with and Monika was able to help me through the process. I was already stranded in the country as I wouldn't be allowed to board my departing flight if the c connection flight isn't purchased. I was freaking out but Monika was able to assure me that everything will be ok. She began the call by apologizing for all the trouble I had to go through even though it wasn't her fault or the fault of Kiwi. She then began to help me through the process of booking my connecting flight, she said she will give me a call once she finds something in an hour and to my surprise she called back in 20 mins and told me there was something available and asked further how I was feeling and told me to not be stressed anymore. Shortly after I gave her the confirmation to book the new flight and I got the email that my flight is all set to go. Monika F was generally a good person who cared about the customer. I personally asked her if I could write a review because I was surprised at how nice someone could be while trying to help out. I would like to thank her and all of kiwi for helping me solve my travel problems. I shall continue to be a loyal customer to kiwi.Thank you Monika F
5	Muy buen servicio al telefono, contestan 24/7 y me han atendido muy amablemente, tanto Clarisa como Adrian me fueron de ayuda, y me resolvieron mis dudas y peticiones.
5	I unfortunately had to cancel my flight but I could not find how to do.Operator Dorota kindly responded me in chat, so problem was solved.
3	A website that shows prices of budget airlines directly on an interactive map for you to pick <https://t.co/E531Of2Bt1>
5	I had some worries about flight details on one leg of a 3 part flight, but Alexey worked with the airlines and confirmed everything was in order. We'd gotten burned by other booking agencies, but SkyPicker is great. 10/10 customer service.
5	Thanks Anna!
5	I will be flying with them in 24 hours. Had a few questions about logistic stuff and I contacted them via instant chat. Very good staff, kind and very helpful, specially Miro, who answered me all the questions. Happy to have found Skypicker!
5	I had a talk with Martin Carter about a mistake i made while booking a flight. Even though it was a major mistake by my mishap that shouldn't have happened in the first place, he did his best to fix it and he did sort out the problem which was wonderful. It was also very fast and efficient. I really appreciated it. He was very pleasant and lovely. The chat service has been all around marvellous with this guy.The website allows you to book flights at a very affordable price and I think that's great.
5	Great support through chat, Norweian Airlines making its thing apparently, however, guys from Kiwi chat, helped me out a lot all along the frustrating adventure, Martin, Daniel and 2 more Guys making great professional work there.
5	Best  priced , resourced and executed .
5	What's there to say? Their front web page with the details of flight pricing for the whole world...That attracted me to Kiwi and will stay here. Thanks!
5	Replying email is very fast and helpful for me. Also, reminding me to provide informatikn and helping me avoid being charged! Thanks Anna Trush!
5	Excelent service, even if I messed up with my e - mail. Everything corrected in 3 min. Thank YOU
1	Security system declined my payment, which is fine sometimes. But Kiwi did not send me email or message informing me about it. I triple-checked spam folder (Gmail) and SMS. Should fix the messaging system and not to waste client's time.
5	Excellent on-line customer service chat!..........
5	Great agent over the chat who was very patient and has helped me with all my doubts and queries. Agente muy amable y dispuesto a ayudar con mucha paciencia. Gracias.
1	Kiwi bought our ticket with their company credit card when we were going to check-in they asked us for the card that was used to purchase the ticket and of course we didn't have it. So the airlines made us buy a new ticket and now i have to claim a refund and i paid for the ticket twice. First time i have had a problem like this in my life.. very disappointed. How come you did not have this agreement with the airlines?
5	Natalia has been great help to me from greeting till the end of the call. All my queries were cleared with proper guidance and patience.  Very happy with the service provided :)  I would surely recommend friends & family to book tickets on Kiwi. Cheers!!
5	I found very quickly the airlines company for my travel and I found at <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com>, a team very responsible for my trip. The team sent me the on-line  check-in in time so I could travel without worries.
4	I just contacted with the agent Tomáš Mužík to ask about flight changes. The taxes are very expensive, I suppose it's a matter with the flight companies but the attention was great and the suggestion that finding a new flight could be sometimes cheaper than paying taxes was pretty honest. Good communication service.
5	Michael Angelo is an angel. I guess its just as her name implies. All these years i've been in Europe, i have not been attended to the way Michael Angelo did attend to me tonight. She effortlessly killed my anger and stress all in a minute to the point that i did not even wish to end the call. I'm sure if she's empowered, i have no doubt she will take her star with her to her new position and keep on shinning.thank you KIWIThank you more Michael Angelo
1	"Had a bad experience with this flight. Had to contact a lot of times via chat and just 4 persons were kind, the last one was MARIA she was great! but like other 12 just said ""We will check and send you an e.mail."" thanks maria and others 4 who really helped."

5	!! Well done, Roman !! I had the pleasure to deal with the employee of the month, Roman Slobodyan. He called me many times to solve my problems, super fast and in perfect English speaking manner. I've dealt with reps from other companies in the past but Roman was by far the best I've ever seen. He checked all the possible solutions for my problem and made extra calls to make sure I'll get the best deal ever. Although he said that it will take him few hours to check the optiins, he called within minutes!!! Well done, Roman!If you consider <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com>, don't think twice as they are the best provider. I spent many days trying to find a best deal, but they by far are the best!!!
4	Very efficient and helpful.  Issis is Offering more help I was asking for.Very happy experience!Rachel Yu
3	Hello!I don&#39;t want my 3 star review to reflect poorly on any of the workers.  They were all extremely helpful and nice--Henry was very personable and made sure he could help me with all my problems.My main problem was the technology.When I rebooked my flight (which cost even more than my original flight), it does not show a confirmation of what I am booking.  And it confirms anyway!  And there is no way to stop it.The site should say something like...&quot;Are you SURE you want to book a flight for 31 May, at 23:30, from New York to Copenhagen to Milan, a 12 hour 55 minute flight?&quot;It says nothing.  Just confirm.  And that is far too much money to just confirm without knowing what you are paying for!And then when I booked the flight, I was only given my OLD receipt--not my new receipt.  So it took me a lot more time than needed.Again--I am very satisfied with the workers.  They treated me with a lot of kindness, which I don&#39;t find in airline companies usually.  But Henry and the other person I talked to, Igor last week, were pleasant and good to talk to.  Henry even gave me travel advice when I asked him about Czech Republic.As a last thought, I wish Skypicker would maybe fight a bit harder for a cheaper flight when I am rebooking... a person should never have to pay MORE for the rebooking flight than he did for the original flight, since those airlines are now making so much money and without doing anything.Thanks and God bless,Michael Ranieri
5	Dear <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>,This is my first time booking a flight with you and am but excited to share that the whole process was very smooth to say the list. However; this would have not been possible without the professionalism and patience presented by Kojo, who in my eyes went far out of his way to help me find the correct itinerary that included a connecting flight from Brussels to Barcelona.Kojo, if you can read this man, I hope we can do it again in the future. Kudos!Respectfully;Juan Sanchez.
5	I would like to start with a huge thank you to Tomas K, Pedro F, and David G for helping yesterday without I ask. You really have the best costumer service. My first flight was cancelled so I lost my second one, and I had no money. I was really scared. I was waiting on the line to the costumer service of LOT, because the service is really slow, for them to solve the problem. Without asking <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> called me saying that they knew about the canceled flight and that they were solving the problem. I was so surprised and happy to hear that. They arrange me a new flight and I didn't had to pay more. They even paid me a hostel in warsaw for me not have to sleep in the airport. I will always be thankful. Truly recomend :)
4	Thank you for your helping Bek! We received our boarding passes immediately! Hoping we will have another chance to book your company's services again!
5	Customer care helped me very much, especially Vendula was proactive and helped me with extra luggage, instead of just polite answer she did the whole thing. Thank you very much.
3	@skypicker testy testy by bence
5	This whole info process was so smooth! Though english is not my native language the phone call was super clear and I got a helpful email. Thank you Johana and Lucia!
5	Filip was super helpful to deal with and went above and beyond his job! He had all of my problems fixed even when the other agents said they couldn't help me. Great job, great service!Thanks Filip :)
5	Skypicker provides custumers with an intuitive medium to plan air travel at the lowest costs.
4	as the title suggest, I am very happy with the online service. I had a question and I had a contact in the live chat within 1 minute. Martin Carter was very friendly and helpful!The fifth star is unfortunately missing because there is no online-check-in for Lufthansa.For any other airline I can definitely recommend <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com>
5	Due to a mistake on my part, I never received my e-ticket. Customer Service Agent Kristina was able to quickly ascertain and rectify the issue. Kristina was friendly and professional and turned me into a loyal customer.
5	At this point I want to thank Martin Carter for helping me finding my bording passes. With his kindly help my problem, that I couldn't find the bording passes, was fastly gone.Thank you!
5	Usually when I need a help from campany, they leave me with nothing. This time Kiwi solved my problem sooner then I thought. Just one message and after 5 min. there is no problem. Special thanks for Ms Sabina J - Travel COnsultant. Very nice and helpful girl. She call me back and  help with everythink what I was asking :)Thank YouSo happy :)
5	For the first time ordered tickets on online service skypicker My Questions was resolved consultant's from the support. Competent staff, friendly communication, quick answers. Thank you, especially Yuriy Vyshtal and Abigail Aurisla Mensah.
1	"First-time customer: I booked  a flight to Spain for a reasonable price. Kiwi charged my credit card. Later on I receive an email that the flight was not booked due to ""technical issues"" and they could refund me in 10 days. When I called the next day they told me the flight could not be booked as no more seats were available. When I looked at flights again, I noticed the same flight but at a higher rate. When I called back they once again said there were no seats, I asked to speak to a manager who finally admitted that the price had increased so they couldn't book the flight. Meanwhile they have charged my credit card for over $1500 and cannot return it for 10days. So no they have my money, have increased the flight, and could not do anything to help. Basically the put up a fake price, charged me for that promised price, lied about why they couldn't book it, then when I called them out, they offered no solutions that would help the customer.Terrible first experience."
1	I ordered and paid for flight tickets online. Got an email saying that there was a technical difficulty and they are offering a totally different flight with a stopover, whereas what I ordered was direct and with a higher fare +$171. They also offered a refund that I will see in 10 days. I went on their website again and they are still offering the low fare available for purchase!!
5	I was due to flight but was unsure if I had to do the check in online myself,I got online help from an operator Kristina Mikulova,she was really helpful all along and answered all my question professionally and efficiently.Thanks Kristina,five stars for you!
5	Great service
4	It was a stressful situation that took to long to be solved from my part, for mistakes made by your company. It also was a great effort to find a person that actually was willing to help me. The last person that help me deserves a 10 for how quick solved my issue and also for his honesty.
5	Great, professional and patient assistance from Ahn. I am very satisfied.
5	Great site planning, trip getting the best deals. Customer support is excellent. Thanks Lydle B. for you assistance with extra baggage. You made the online booking process easy. Thanks Mal
4	I found the booking process with SkyPicker very easy and understandable. Even though as a first time user the many steps required filled me with a bit of un unease, after completing my reservation and booking everything went without any problems. For the price payed I'd say the trip was exactly right. Had a long layover in Paris without a decent possibility to explore the city for the few hors given.The great part was that I didn't have to do all the online check-in or other annoying stuff that usually takes up a bit of time and nerves. SkyPicker handled that part really well. I can't give any feedback ou check-in luggage as I was traveling really light with just a backpack and a pair of shoes.So, if time is not an issue and your looking for an inexpensive flight, I'd definitely recomend you to chech SkyPicker out.
5	Really helpfull and clear. Thanks for the kind help!
1	"4days ago, I got this message from Vlasta Brzobohata (Customer relations).""Dear Mr Koh,I am sorry to hear that. In this case I will forward your refund request to our Finance Department to process with the refund. We will inform you once the refund has been transferred to your account. Please accept my apology for the inconvenience that you had to go through.On behalf of Skypicker,Vlasta BrzobohataCustomer relations""And after I got this mail, I bought new ticket at the Vietjet Air.Because I believed your words.But today I got the another mail from Anastasiia Kopivska.(Travel Consultant)""Thank you for your answer.Unfortunately, in this case we cannot offer refund as we were trying to help you with options and, eventually, found the identical flight and offered. We are sorry if it seemed longer than expected but we tried to do our best cooperating with the airline and tried to help you within our guarantee.We are sorry for inconvenience.Kind regards,Anastasiia KopivskaTravel Consultant<http://Skypicker.com|Skypicker.com>""I wonder why you change your words.You just burning my time and ruining my jouney.I wonder if there is any intention to be legally responsible for reversing what you said. If you can not offer refunding my money, how will you recompense my money? Skypicker's replying service is so slow, then I wrote those questions on here."
5	Thank you very much for the quick response and for the help..Lucie o'Bryan helped me to fix a mistake that i did with my name and she immediately called the airline in order to fix it without any charge..Thank you for your patience!!
5	I'm really happy with the service I've received from Skypicker and especially Jonathan who kept me updated with information regarding my booking during check-in. :airplane:
1	My tickets and reserve were canceled right before departure, so i had to buy new tickets right in airport, spend more money, and waste time to speak in online-chat with support.I was told by support that i will receive my money back in 5-7 days, but i'm afraid that i won't receive anything and have to waste more time to solve that problem.
5	Smooth booking, no hassle whatsoever...would recommend and use again!
1	Guaranteed to miss if you book with these useless pricks. Do yourself a favour and go Expedia
5	skypicker is an amazing website ... their customer service is just amazing ..... i will travel with them ... Antonin Vrzalhelped me a lot . thank you so much ..
5	I stupidly booked my flights for a month ahead! So I immediately contacted Kiwi customer service via the web chat. Tomas quickly managed to adjust the flight to the day required free of charge. Very helpful!! Would use again.
5	Very happy with the customer support team. Babak from customer services was more than helpful.
5	Archie was very very helpful with our reservation. Quick and friendly helpful! Thank you very much again!!!!
5	I've had a very positive, fast and constructive experience on helpchat with ALIKHAN. Very happy, very helpfull :)
5	I am satisfied with this service. The price was quite good, costumer service was helpful and punctual, I did not have to worried about boarding pass or anything else.
1	I booked a flight through Kiwi on the 26th for the 28th from Tel Aviv to Toronto, only to discover that they booked it for the 27th (after the flight had left). I really hope someone from Kiwi can resolve this error immediately so that I can make a wedding in Toronto on the 28th.
5	I cannot say enough in praise of <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>. My daughters flight was delayed and she missed her next flight connection. I rang their customer service and immediately was in touch with staff who I felt were extremely helpful. In particular I would like to mention Christina and Catalina who had great empathy for my and my daughter's situation, they organised the re-booking of flights home within an hour. I would recommend <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> to all.
5	Customer Service was great to me. They helped me with adding additional services to my flight in a very short period of time. Thank you Jan for all the support. With kiwi's great service I feel confident about my long flight coming up very soon. Hope everything turns out great.
5	Special thanks to @Kristina Blahová for helping me to correct my name on my flight tickets without any charge.
4	Good service, Lukas P from the chat was super fast and nice with his help!
5	Anna S is simply one of the most service minded problem solver I've ever been in contact with onlineShe is the reason why I give stars... Perfect service
4	I'll like to say thank you to the Kiwi team for their excellent customer service. I have been attended by Adam Trcala who was really kind, patient and helpful and who helped me solved my problems in a really efficient way... i did miss a connecting flight because of the airline delay but thanks to Kiwi I have been refunded twice the price of the flight I missed!! Iam really impressed by the great customer service !!!Thanks a lot Kiwi and especially Adam!!!
5	I had a chat with Zuzana S and it was like chatting with a friend. Very friendly person. I hope this feedback comes up to their big screens in their office. Hey Zuzana, you did great! :)
4	I used the live chat feature on Kiwi when recently looking at flights. I had a few questions and was guided through the process by Anastassia G. Her patience and pleasant disposition really helped. I generally hate working with airlines and booking tickets given the increased cost and the strict policies on baggage and whatnot. Anastassia was thorough in answering my questions and explaining things I should be mindful of with the tickets I was looking at. She made what is usually a stressful process much easier and much better compared to other live chats or customer service experiences. Kiwi's guarantees and cheap prices are good but having such excellent customer service staff makes them even better. Thank you!
5	Thanks a lot for helping me after i typed my passport details wrong. And the seats were very good in both two flights. I will keep on choosing you. Thanks.
5	Evrything was fine!Ms. Aurelija was really helpfull.I hope that all could stay like this until the final of the journey...
5	I would like to thank Elena, who helps me a lot with my mistake during check-in! :) really nice company, no problems, very fast and cheap ;)
5	The straightforward UI is uncluttered and non-stressful. I needed a change on the invoice and Dorota kindly forwarded my request to the financial department. Kiwi is my go-to website for plane tickets now.
5	I had a problem with my online check-in so I used the online chat in order to figure it out. I was litterally surprised how fast they answer me and how helpful the staff was (Kristina Mikulova in my case). I would recommend that booking site which is really reactive in case of problem.
5	I did a terrible mistake in my reservation. Thank you very much for arranging a visit to Bali. Youlim Son, many thanks for helping me :)
5	They made me feel comfortable and were very understanding of any concerns I had as a solo traveler.
5	I booked a flight but couldn't do the online registration because it was the day just before the departure (and not 72h before)... never saw that anywhere and i was upset because it would have cost 70€ per person to do it at the airport!!!I used the chat service, it was very easy and fast, Issis answered very well my questions and solved the problem within 5 minutes. Thank you very much!
4	The site is very good and it keep you in contact with the team till the end of  fly.
5	I had to call today as i had deleted my e tickets and confirmation emails i called and a lovely girl called keira answered had a bit of a problem with accents as i come from glasgow but once i  slowed my speech down we could understand each other perfectly .....anyway i would just line to thank keira as i now have my tickets ....i must also say that i WILL be using this vompany when i am booking my next holidayThanks again keiraDerek harper
5	Skypicker is very useful flight app!Simple to choose tickets, cheap prices and great service! I was really impressed by their brilliant and quick service,thank you Lucy!Thank you to all Skypicker team, you make so hard work!Will plan my trips only with you for sure!
4	What I like the most with the service is that they are very reactive.When you need help they call you on you phone few minutes later.The online hat also very efficient.So good job guys, and thank you to Julia G !Pap
5	I asked some things about my flight and Youssef's service was great!!
4	Thank you Youssef for good service when i could not fine where i fulfil my information to check in online. That could be more clear. But fast and easy help so no worries. Thankx
5	I am very satisfied with the services provided by <http://KIWI.COM|KIWI.COM>, helpful staff, good work.
2	A startup that finds discount flight tickets 'hidden' on airline websites just launched <https://t.co/fQaX1N1yfU> <https://t.co/9ihlVjB4HF>
5	I just came back from a flight with Skypicker. Everything went fine, I read all the mandatory information and when I had any question a care specialist called Yulia Bernatskaya helped to solved it out, so i would say that you are not going to face any problem travelling with them! :)
5	Yulia was very nice and solved our little problem :)
5	I needed help with trying to change my flight time, and Jan was super helpful and answered all the questions I had about my flight.
5	Rang to add luggage and found the service super efficient and helpful. I thought the additional price was quite high and the lady I spoke to actually looked into it for me and emailed me later that night with a better price which I have now booked. It wasn't much cheaper so this isn't just a comment on price it's really a comment on good customer service. It's rare these days to feel anyone is bothered about your best interests. Thank you Kristyna Mlcuchova :)
5	I had to make name amendments on our booking and Lydie, the support assistant was very helpful via chat. She provided quick feedback and solutions to our questions.
4	So I didn't know they did the check in (they could make it more obvious for people who are used to doing the check in on their own) for their customers so I contacted one of their agents through IM (the name of the agent is Thomaš Jurík) so he helped me to do the check in. He was very kind and helpful. I liked their customer service.. Though I'm still waiting for my boarding pass, but as far as I understood this depends on the airline's services of sending the boarding passes.
5	I had a problem with my booking information and Jan Lukasek solved it in no time, taking a big burden off my back. I even had to leave for a minute and Jan called my in an effort to solve my problem, and that's not something you are used to when contacting a support center. So I really recommend using Kiwi because if anything happens to you, you now there is a great team behind :-)
5	I just booked a flight with Skypicker from SJC to OPO with the best available price in the market. Alikhan was a great help when we called the Skypicker service, giving me all the information about the flight, details about the companies, he didn't leave any detail behind. It was the best costumer service I had with airlines. Thank you very much for everything.
1	Tried to get them to change the date of my flight and add an additional one, tried to charge us $300 Euro for the charge where we could get it done for under $200 AUD.  We were told by Skypicker we had to amend the booking through them for the higher price.  Thankfully the helpful people at Air Asia managed to help us out and amend the booking despite Sky-pickers interference. Don't recommend, unnecessary middleman trying to skim profit from you. book the tickets yourself through the airline and save yourself some trouble.
5	It was most easy reservations in my life! tickets was on my mail after 15-20 mins, and i didn't do check in on flights, but i had 6 flights! All boarding passes i accept on my mail before 7 days to my trip, it's so comfortable, because sometimes i forget about this! Thankful Skypicker for care)
5	Thank you very much for your great help.. the support team really assist me all through out until my concern is really met.. more power skypicker.
5	Thank you very much to your quick action regarding the correction of name i booked...I am very much pleased to your service..a compAny i can recommend.
5	Petr really help me with my problem, he was really kind and helpful, more employees like him !
5	"i am so satisfied with the service, I was so panic when I just realized that Ive been booking the wrong date at that time, then i would like to change it. I called my dad, he told me that the international flight would not refund me, but I am not giving up. Then, I click the contact person in the sky picker website, i try to ask for a help and tweet them in twitter. They respond me and I saw they really work hard in helping me, if I am not mistaken it takes 12 hours to finished my trouble. I am so grateful because I was booking a ticket in a right place, ""Sky Picker"", for me it is a trusted company with an excellent service, so I put 5 star ratings to this. I also recommend this company to my friend, her name is athya I recommend her to book a ticket in sky picker, because it provide the cheapest flight and also good service in way to pleasent to consument.There's a lot of travel agent website. But the only thing that keeps in my mind, I love sky picker and no other travel website could replace sky picker in my heart."
5	I reserved tickets with <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> at first. I had some problems with filling form on website. The support agent Gabi helped me with it. Thanks to <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>
5	These are the best travel agents I have ever used and I have been travelling 40 years I will use them again. Thank you for everything you are the bestMarilyn
5	Got some help checking in online from a guy calle de Pedro.
5	After a full day of receiving bad news regarding flight bookings due to poor service directly booking through airlines, Kiwi was there to save the day (Kristina, David P. & Anastasiya specifically). Imagine being on the phone for 10 hours straight with airlines and different companies just to book a few simple flights, that continuously had issues of visa payment processing, calls back saying you can't pay with credit card less than 72 hours prior to flight departure etc. It was exhausting, but finally, with fingers crossed and help of the amazing customer service reps at Kiwi, I was able to get the flight I needed just in time. They were great, actively keeping me updated VIA PHONE CALLS (not emails) as they showed they truly cared and wanted to help given my situation. Thank you Kiwi for your help. I will gladly book with Kiwi again in the future and recommend them to others.
4	Thanks to Varvara S. and Alexey T. we got all sorted out after we had some questions and also changes to be done to our booking.
5	They bought us a new plane ticket, offered 50 euro for hotel and 10 euro for refreshments (while Ryanair didn't do ****). Thanks Kiwi!
5	It is easy to buy ticketsIt is easy to contact customer support Those guys from staff  had very good attitude with me. I like to thank you that you have edited a passenger's name from Safi airways and Norwegian Kbl-- Dubai & Dubai-- Arlanda . Specially Mr Babak Soltani an 2 others lady's, I don't remember there's name.
5	It's the easiest flight booking website. I love it! This is how booking flights should be - transparent, hassle-free, quick. Really glad you guys exist! :)
1	THESE CLOWNS got my wifes name wrong and nationality resulting in us needing a visa. and we were refunded £8 from £330 . Unable to do anything. And my number was also blocked. I have lost £322 . My bank investigated the matter and kiwi sent false information to my bank and I have no way of proving that.Do not use this service.
5	<https://t.co/YJB9Y8EhMP>Je to tak :-)
4	For the first time ordered tickets on online service skypicker My Questions was resolved consultant's from the support. Competent staff, friendly communication, quick answers. Thank you, especially Yuriy Vyshtal and Abigail Aurisla Mensah.
5	Vladimir F. and Victor S.'s help was great. I found this service really helpfull. Congratulations for the system.
5	Helpful! Zora S. gave me information about what options I might have for leaving my luggage at the airport, so I don't have to carry around bags while visiting the city I have a layover in.
4	Thanks you skypick for everything to help us.I'm very happy to with your service and thanks you again!!!
1	My daughter bought flight tickets today to go to Palma when the confirmation came through it was totally wrong, husbands name wrong, and tickets the other way around - they have been totally useless saying it was all her fault no refunds what so ever - please do not book with this company
5	I have done all my booking and boarding pass procedures with online skypicker agents.I would like to thank Vlada Gusar for her patience and kindness:)))Great job Vlada Gusar .Thank you very much:)))
5	I'd like to thank to SkyPicker team. I had great experience with them. The organization of my trip to Frankfurt and back was on high level. I'll continue to book tickets through this company in further.
4	After a mistake with a reservation due to their system, I want to thanks the team and specially Jamila who give me a very good and quick service.
5	too fast for reply on live chat (: thanks
4	The open live chat is just a wonderful service that skypicker honors. I had a great agent, Jan, who took care of my request with rapidity and efficiency. Since i discover skypicker i'm totally sold to it for many reasons which includes the services and the easy searching tools option.
5	Great job by Miquel! He helped me out through a series of reservations and special considerations, always professional and kind
1	I have booked a connected flights from Kiwi. Because of health problems, I had to cancel it and called the kiwi for refund.-10 days before the flight.They said I should fill a refund form and it lasts 30 business days for refund.after that day I chatted everyday and after 4 days; kiwi said no refund from the two airlines that I have booked. They don't take responsibility they don't send legal document or they don't give information from their website. They just say it is airlines terms.! It is a cheap trick! I have never ever use their websites or such unprofessional companies!
4	RT @AnataSanea: Discount airfare site Skypicker offers travelers new ways to find cheap flights <https://t.co/CWa4fn1qNr>
5	I accidentally typed incorrect passport information into kiwi, luckily my man Tomas was on hand to really quickly fix my problems. Great and quick service
5	I made a mistake while booking my flight and entered in the incorrect email address. After talking with Eva O. on the online help chat space, she fixed my email address and I left a happy customer! Thank you, Eva O.!! I really appreciate your help! You're an asset to your company!
4	it was my first time to book the LCC ticker via internet last week. Since I didn't know much about the limitation of LCC, i missed to book for my baggage. So, i asked for help via skype and  Travel Consultant at that time was Enri Akhvlediani, who was a very nice person and help me to solve my problems and answer my questions. So, thank you so much.Best regardsmelissa
4	Good customer service, very prompt, received boarding passes on time.
5	We weren't sure about booking our flight trough Kiwi because of all the bad reviews, but we still took the risk and we had a good experience. Everything went well, no surprises. And we saved a lot of money too!
5	I needed help for an error with my reservation and Kostya was helpful and very friendly :) Thanks Kostya and thanks Kiwi !
5	I had a problem with a payment refund and cancellation and call their Customer Service. Melinda (the girl who attended me) helped me very well and solved my problem.I am very satisfied with the service of the company
1	"Try to avoid using this company - they cancelled our confirmed flight with one weeks notice and did not offer to rebook our flights. Now we are stuck with our booked transport from the destination which we cannot cancel. The company did not offer to compensate for this either.AVOID THEM or risk getting this message a week before your planned departure""We regret to inform you but unfortunately we haven't book your flights due to technical issue which occurred with you reservation. Refund procedure has been initiated already. You will get full refund  within 7 -10 working days, we are sorry for the inconvenience it might cause you. """
5	This is the first review I have ever written, good or bad, about any company. I booked 2 flights for 31st March using Skypicker; one from Manchester to Brussels and then a connecting. flight to Marseeille.Once I landed in Brussels, I discovered that my budget airline (name withheld) flight to Marseile had been cancelled due to a strike in France. Distressed and upset, I immediately phoned Skypicker to see if they could help. The employee I spoke with was extremely kind and helpful and, although she was unable to find me a  new flight to Marseille due to a national strike in France, promised to refund all the money I had spent with Skypicker for the 2 flights. The money was back in my account within 24 hours, and I believe this is a far better and faster outcome I would have received from the budget airline, if I had dealt directly with them.I will not hesitate to use Skypicker again and I will definitely recommend it to my friends.John, Warrington.
5	I am very satisfied with <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> application and services and will use it exclusively for all my next flights!
4	Had a query with my flight booking and used the live chat to discuss with one of Kiwis agents. Very helpful and promised to contact airline and email me back. I was a little be sceptical as that's sometimes how they fob you off, but within an hour email received and then also follow up emails from different members of the customer service team and the issue was resolved satisfactorily. Very impressed
5	#Skypicker one of the best free tools to find low airfares, according to @CBSNews Travel Editor @PeterSGreenberg: <https://t.co/N4zkXLBWIE>
4	I had to change my flights booked through Skypicker. As they can't repay me without all the individual airlines acceptance, I've had to do quite some work,without knowing if it will succeed...  But as I needed advices, I checked out their online chat and Nikola H. Was a great help! Thank you!
5	Filip was amazing, I had to change my passport number because of a typo and the next morning I have an email stating that it's done. Flying tomorrow, looking forward.
5	(Wednesday, April 27th 2016)I had a question regarding the documents I needed to bring along to the airport, as it was the 1st time I had booked a flight through <http://skypicker.com|skypicker.com>Henry from Skypicker was kind enough to help me out in this matter, as well as answer additional questions I had about possible delays and departure changes. In other words, his help and service were very useful. Thank you!
4	Good and quick service
1	What a terrible company. Don't even offer an admin fee for a change of flight, instead offer the flight at its full price. The people on the phone can't speak much English. Done absolutely nothing to help me. Will never book with these idiots again.
5	I found the process very easy to follow, and when I had questions, Tomas U via live chat provided me with answers promptly and with excellent customer service.  Wonderful experience.  Thanks
5	Cannot give a full review yet, before the trip, but MARTINA at online chat was superb! Thanks so much for your kind and patient help :).
4	I accidentally put the wrong last name for the person I am traveling with when booking our trip. It was somewhat difficult to get someone on the line to fix the problem, but once I did, I spoke with Emre, and he went above and beyond calling both airlines that we are traveling through to get the name changed without a fee. He called me back twice during the process to update me on the status, which I really appreciated as well. Thank you Emre and <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>!
1	FRAUD SITE, CHEATING PEOPLE BY CREATING AIRLINES THAT DOESN'T EVEN EXIST !!!
5	I bought a ticket and I found out after I payed that I put my first name on both first and last name, I contacted the support right away and great thanks to wiki support guys Daniel and Lukas that helped me change the name without any extra fee! Thanks guys! Keep it up!
4	I had the best price and great service!There have been some problems but were resolved in an excellent way.I was not able to check in due to an enquiry, I called kiwi and I immediately was helped and received the boarding passes in my email.Afterwards, I discovered that a mistake had been made in my lastname, on the boarding passes.  I was very stressed out as I left in less than 24h and did not want to pay the additional fees, due to a misspelled name (this can go up to 150€ at some airlines). Fortunately Kiwi managed to change my name for my round-trip, at BOTH airlines without any additional costs!10/10!
5	Due to technical reasons one of the connected flights of our route was delayed and an other one was even withdrawn. On spot they could not offer us a good solution, but Stanislav from Kiwi helped us out by finding an alternative way to get to the final destination in time! Thank you so much for your kind help Stanislav! Great work from you and Kiwi! Armand and Monica.

4	"I had really big problems with my tickets and with payment, I was soo nervous and everytime during the weekend when I called and I tried to explained what is my problem nobody understood me and they just told me everytime"" dont worry, just give us some time, everything is in procces"" but it wasn´t true!! Finally 3 days latter,when I spooke to Martin and Zdenka from Czech Republic they helped me to solve my problem and they explained me what´s wrong. I am so thankfull to them, now me and my friend can go to Barcelona for New Years Eve just thanks to them. I know that I did few mistakes too, but I really didnt know about them, but now I know and everything is finally ok."
4	Radek was very helpful with customer service. There was an error in the system but that was easily cleared up with his expeditious work. Overall, satisfied with Skypicker for their services.
5	I just booked a flight to Barcelona and had some problems with my emails...  Olga thanks for sorting it out quickly and with such a friendly manner. I owe you a coffee
4	Very good service by Tanya :)4 stars because i speak french and i ´m bad i english, so if i had a french service, it was more easy for me.
5	No problems at all with Kiwi service.  I had to add my middle name to the tickets which I had prompt service to assist me.  I also had to add additional luggage allowance just a day before my flight which was no issue at all.   Service was prompt.  Will recommend and will use again in my future travel plans.
4	We had some doubts but I opened the live chat and Lucie answered. She was very patient with my English and then I realized that she spoke Spanish as well. It helped me a lot. Thanks for every thing Lucie.
5	Oman air: There is anybody had experienced with oman air???i bought tickets from skypicker...kuala lumpur to d...  <http://t.co/C98FqftxLY>
4	I communicated with Artem and Zdenka. Weary good service. Quick, informative, loyal. They answered all my questions and helped me quickly solve my problems.
5	Thank you Aurelija, you were very helpful and professional.I would definitely recommend your company to any one booking in future. The 24/7 help desk service is also a great relief to finally have a company that knows that people need help also outside the usual 9 - 17 hours.
1	Worst experience trying to fly with your company you try beat every company with price but your hopeless you don't help until it's too late and we had to miss our flight and still had to pay for it you have stuffed us around so much and had to spend a lot of money trying to find acomadation unless you can refund us our money and help us to reach our destination our opinion is going to stay the same
5	very effective live chat managed my booking and checked me in online
5	Love the interatcive website, with suggested destinations and prices,in the map at the side, and the actual prices are what you pay....now that's what I like !!Everything was as it should be , even down to sending me the boarding passes .Excellent job, have already recommended Skupicker to friends who HAVE booked on it and I will definitely use it again...Skypicker is now Bookmarked !!
5	i was a wrong reservation. i want to change boarding pass name.my agent, natalia is very kind. although i'm korean, she help me well. i tell her my wrong reservation, right now she checked my matter. finally i completed my booking.thank you natalia !natalia is very very kind.
4	Good experience as a customer. Serviceminded and helpful. Got help really quick and easy. Thanks to Jan who fixed my problem at no time. Recommended!
5	easy to operate, many optional proposals, quick to book, no problem with check in
5	I had a problem to find my boarding pass and Nikola help me as fast as I needed.Thank you so much for the support.
1	Worst experience ever!. Terrible service, ridiculous fees and poor organization.
5	Skypicker allowed to easily find the best priced flights for my dates. Prices were mapped out on a calendar, making it easy to see which dates saved money. The information, itinerary, and boarding passes were sent to me on time. Skypicker made it easy for me to travel.
5	I got helpd by an agent calld lenka she was amazing and realy kind and helpfull i would like to put in a realy good word on her and hope that all the agents in the company are like that
5	I noticed my name was missing two letters in my middle name. I called Kiwi and spoke with Adam Jelínek, he promptly called the airlines and e-mailed me back with a confirmation that he managed to get the name changed for free.Excellent service. Thank you, Adam!!
3	At about 8pm I discovered that the flight I had booked for 10am next morning would actually depart at 3pm. That was a major problem because I was connecting to other flights. I contacted <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> via the online chat system.The service team was understanding and kind, and I really had the impression they tried to help me in this situation. I liked that there were no attempts to wiggle out of their responsibility, and I felt assured that they would take care. I would probably book with them again.That said, it took a full 2 hours of online chatting to be booked on a new flight. They got my problem in the first few minutes, so it really took them so long to change my flight. That was a bit funny.
5	Lucie Polívková is an excellent professional.She helped me solve my problem quickly and with extreme sympathy.Thank you Lucie wish you the greatest success in the world.Best regardsFilipe Costa
5	Nice to see @businessinsider writes about company where I work -> @skypickercom :) <https://t.co/AdkJ6IHFne>
5	I tried every other website and this is the one I fiund with the cheapest tickets and with skypicker guaranty it's even more safe.
5	Kiwi were fast and effective in delivering information which helped me easily navigate my 2 connecting flights and even helped me in locating hotels nearby. Id like to give a big shout out to my boy Eric.
5	This guys were very quick and helpful solving my problem!! :)
1	Please don't use this website. They appear as cheaper option in comparison sites but when you actually try and book, they add their service fees and it turns out to dearer than any other site. Also, they don't actually have courtesy for elderly travellers, even after my request to create a booking with through check-in for an elderly passenger, they booked independent tickets forcing the elderly passenger to go through immigration in transit and recheck in baggage. They have a policy which don't even let you discuss these with the flight company. So a definitely don't choose this site. A Definite NO NO!!!
5	We reached Patrick on the phone, very helpfull!
4	Cheap tickets, and very helpfull staff. Karen helped me at online chat, because I got confused about boardinpasses and online check in. Thank you Karen :)But on the down side, if you have to postpone your trip, for some reason (mine, that a football match got postponed in liverpool), they are NOT helpfull OR cheap. Changing the date cost as much as new tickets, and some part of our journey could not be postponed at all, and required new tickets all together. We lost 350 dollars :-( and had to buy new tickets, when the new match date was realised.
4	Unfortunately sky picker do not offer to change the flight without Mastercard or Visa. I paid my Booking with Maestro. But I did accidentally a mistake and choosed a wrong date. So I wanted to change, but it is only possible with credit or visa card. They are also not refundable. (that's why 4 stars)So I had to book a new Flight. With Maestro(link to <http://sofort.com|sofort.com>) again.BUTI want to mention that all the customer service people wich I had contact to were very patience with my issues and very kind. I am very impressed. (5 stars)Thank you to Martin Carter Smehlik, Mayyas Hazeemeh and two other customer servers which I do not know the name anymore.Thank youKramer
4	Tomas was quick at helping me solve my problem and relieving a great bit of stress. Polite, kind, considerate, and patient.
4	I had a problem regarding the email confirmation of the booking of my son and filip went out of his way to check that i missed 1 letter in the email address that i wrote. Job well done and thanks so much for the patience filip. Gbu
4	Discount airfare site Skypicker offers travelers new ways to find cheap flights - <https://t.co/3FP8BP5g6Q> <https://t.co/pHqmKg4yAe>
5	At first it was hard to communicate with the service team because of english barriers. Then I asked for a supervisor. Tomáš Mužík did a great job helping to solve my problem. HE went out of his way to find a solution. Thank you for your help.
1	"We booked airline tickets from Danang to Seoul on Kiwi.  Then booked an airline ticket from Seoul to the USA based on the first tickets time and date.  Went to bed and woke up to an email stating we must contact them within 12 hours otherwise our tickets would be cancelled.  Unfortunately, it had been 13 hours.  I called Kiwi and they said our credit card denied the charges.  The credit card company denied that.  Called Kiwi again and got their call center in India(?).  To summarize, three days have passed, I have called 5 times and keep getting no answer.  Only ""We will call you back"" and Kiwi never calls back.  We are currently in Bali and the time difference makes communication with Kiwi impossible.  The security office is NOT 24 hours a day.  Only the answering service is 24 hours, but they can not help anyone with anything.  Maybe Kiwi would work if you live (and TRAVEL) on in their time zone, BUT AMERICANS and ASIANS beware!!  Kiwi agents if you read this PLEASE, PLEASE reach out to us.  We are still scrambling trying to find alternate arrangements to get to SEOUL.  I will revise this review if you help us.  We travel full-time and book 3+ tickets a month.  This was our first, and now our last, experience with your awful service unless you call us back!"
5	I had some problems with my tickets and Yura helped me a lot! Very good service!
3	I am trying to get an airport tax refund for a canceled flight, so far the online chat has worked great and I Basilio Paz was a very helpful agent.
5	I have to say that the 24/7 service works perfectly fine, and I haven't used my flights but i have to say that so far the booking and the service was pretty easy, faster, and cheaper than other ones, I had questions about the luggage specifications and check in filled by them, normally i do those things, so i was a little bit shocked and wanted to be sure about that fact that was already filled by them... Michal and Daniel helped me a lot and were very patient at any moment, I just hope that I can finish this experience without any epic fail on the airports... but im very satisfied for the moment. Thanks
5	We needed help to check-in to our second flight. Pavel Fridrich were a such good help :-) now we feel more comfortable with the check-in, flight and all. Thank you Pavel
5	I had a quick answer and helpfully.. Ivana was very nice and she helped me a lot. Thank you for your service. Keep going ahead...Armi.
5	<http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> always is very rapid in their repsonses. Love the 24/7 online chat, was very helpful, to the point. Lenka did a great job.
5	Not long off the phone with Mariya Potello regarding cabin baggage. I can honestly say it was more than a pleasure having Mariya deal with my enquiry. She not only was pleasant but went above and beyond to ensure we received the correct information promptly. She also ensured we were happy and received all the information we required.. I must admit I was skeptical using services like kiwi, but can honestly say I have not had one negative experience.. Mariya is more than a credit to kiwi as a company.. Thank you Mariya!!
5	I was a little worried at first when I thought I missed the check-in deadline, but I used the live chat feature, and worked with Irena, who was incredibly helpful and took care of adding my travel document information. The live chat feature is really wonderful, and I would confidently book with Skypicker again in the future! Thanks to Irena and the whole Skypicker team!
5	I talked with Jonathan for some flight detail changes and he was very helpful .
1	I book bussiness trips every day for my company and this is the worst and unpersonal service I've ever had... I had to call about 5 times (20 mins each call= waste of time= no solutions). I wrote many emails and I was never contacted by phone, although I required it... In conclusion, many emails and any solution and bad service... I'm not taking any other service with them as long as I can avoid it.
5	Thank you for helping me out in a very tough time! Can't thank you guys more! Their service is excellent! They helped me with everything and I'm very thankful for that!
5	appreciated viktors help great serviceI don't know ref number but live chat was on 5.02.17 at 19.10
5	Thank you for helping me to add extra baggage to take important items over to the refugees in Idomeni. I would not have been able to do the work I wanted without your help.
3	@skypickercom I had talked with Eva in customer service but she never called me back
2	Booked my flight from California to Asia. the process was easy. customer service was responsive.That said, I had two main issues:1. after i booked my flight. just out of curiosity, i checked prices on other sites which i should've done before I booked. I found out that for each of my connecting flights, booking directly with the airline was at least $40 cheaper than prices i paid to skypicker. and this can't be because prices changed because I literally checked right after. (normally travel sites have similar prices and I got lazy this time. big mistake).2. I have a united airline reward credit card that gives me priority boarding and 1 free checked bag as long as i use this credit card to pay for my travel. I never had issues getting this benefit when I booked my tickets through other travel agency sites. However, it looks like Skypicker is unable to pass my credit card info to the airline. Instead, the airline is seeing a credit card number, which I do not own, under my booking receipt. (i am assuming that's skypicker's company card).  Needless to say i will have to pay extra for checked bag which could've been avoided by booking with a different travel site. I contacted the customer service at skypicker and they said there isn't anything they can do which was disappointing because i never had this type of issue with other sites.
4	So far, so good. Very helpful live chat with Filip. He was very nice, polite and eager to help.Thanks!!!
5	Tried to book flights from Japan to Thailand on 14th of June because price was really good, though the booking page is a bit confusing. I needed direct flights only, one of the agents told me there’re none, although that’s not true. Luckily, I had another chat and got answers to all of my questions. Would like to thank Yulia Y. who was very helpful and informative.
1	@skypickercom Booked chennai flight for 25th, ticket looks cancelled. Customer service response poor. BNo# 407893
5	Very helpful chat helpline! Your employee Phana helped me with my problem quick and easy! :) Super!
5	Thank you for 5 star communication!
5	I have tolked with Maria and she helped me with everything that I needed.
5	I had a couple of questions and was helped by a member of the team named Issis. Super helpful and helped me with everything I needed to know. Highly recommend!
1	Skypicker. com are very rude and unpleasant if you have trouble. In this case Skypicker. com made a booking error so we missed our flight. We were promissed a full refund (got an email as proof - very nice and helpful mail), but they still haven't refunded the amount. It has now been almost 4 months!We cannot recommend Skypicker. com!
5	I would like to thank miss Natalia for her fast response on live chat and her cooperation
5	Thanks Daria you been great and offering me good services for the flight ticket and chech in and you seams to be a very good person!i aprecciate!people,she is the best!have a nice day!!!
5	You will not appreciate <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> services untill you get in troubles. I am stuck in Barcelona on my way to Accra for third day already and Bara from customer services was just great. Even though she probably knew she can't do much about my situation, she tried to find a solution anyway. She argued with the airlines so I didn't have to and I am really really really greatful for that because if I argued with them I would probably just cry out of hopelessness :)) Thanks again!
5	i just want to thanks Anna Trush she is veri good worker...
5	the representatives are very very friendly and helpfuly, Rodo, Daniel and Lenka helped me with all my doubts and were very patients with me, they really cared about my issue, thank you so so much guys!
5	Great service!Thank you very much Abigail M. I very appreciated your effort on changing my flight in time.I'm looking forward to my stay abroad thanks to you.Kind regards,Tobi
5	I had made a mistake with my email addresse and was not receiving the confirmation email.. So i open a live chat window and the problem was solved within 5 min! Thanks Babak, you were great help!
5	Excellent customer service! Thanks Lucia a Marketa for your support
1	This is a summary of what went wrong with my trip managed by Kiwi:1. I could not print my boarding pass with Primera Air, which was extremely uncomfortable since that was my second flight, not the first. So I had to check out the security area, wait for their staff to open their counter and re-enter the security area in the commuting airport. I do not know if that is a problem with Kiwi or Primera Air, but given point 2 my suspicions are for Kiwi.2. I have a lot of problems and time wasted trying to manage my reservations at the flight company's websites. This is because the data used for registering was some generic from Kiwi and not mine. For example, the email entered in the booking was not mine's but some Czech email automatically generated from Kiwi. You can imagine the inconveniences this can cause. I had problems with Iberia, Ryanair and Primera Air (all the companies involved in my trip). It was extremely annoying for Ryanair since I could not assign my flight to my profile and get notifications, which, guess what, turned out to be important. My flight was delayed for 4 hours and I did not get any status update in my phone, while other passengers received theirs because their mobile phones were correct. I guess someone at Kiwi received my notification. Also, Kiwi did not send any information at all.In overall, my travel experience was very poor and it was very clear to me that their management system is clumsy and unpolished, causing major disturbances to passengers.I have learnt the lesson: not anymore with Kiwi.
5	I provided the wrong email address when booking my flight so I had to contact customer support for changing it. Fortunately, Kiwi has a 24 hour live-chat service free of charge. I received imidiately a response and in just 3 min we were done with the change and I received my flight tickets with an email.Very helpful customer support, name of Kiwi-agent was Tetyana.
3	@skypickercom I have made a booking with you for a Whizzair flight and would like to add a bag directly with the airline. How to proceed?
5	Travel Consultant Theodore V. was great. he did his best.
4	jakub helped me and he was really kindly and friendly to handle my problem
5	Today I needed some help regarding my ticket so I used the online chat. There I was greeted by Puput who was extremely helpful concerning my ticket and also gave me some good tips on several experiences in my travel destination. Great service!
5	Great experience. Missed connecting flight because of a delay. Kiwi bought me a new ticket.
5	Quite fast communication and excellent service! I had a chat with Serhii that helped me to add an extra luggage for the flight on less than 24h; great service!!!The previous day I did it also with Eleonora, that helped me very fast.
4	I was deeply satisfied by the customer support services provided by <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>, especially the agent responsible for my case - Aliz.She demonstrated perfect etiquette in specifically explaining the answers to the questions that I had. She was also kind and understanding when I had told her I had no experience in the matter of flights and she helped me find the best solutions for my problems.Despite a few shortcomings regarding the ability to change your flight details (eg. introducing a passport number after the initial booking), I was pleasantly surprised with the amount of dedication in the Kiwi team.The only recommendation I would make for the team would be to give a bit more flexibility to the customers, otherwise, I find it great!
5	I misspelled my email address during booking, customer service fixed problem in minutes
5	Exceptional service.I am extremely pleased with my experiences via <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>.Several staff members helped me make adjustments to my reservation – smoothly arranging for the correction of a misspelled passenger name, and contacting my airline directly to sort out baggage.  This type of assistance is uncommon and very appreciated.A big thank you to Anastassia G., Cristina, Monika F., Aliz I., Lorena G., Kateryna Y. and all others who helped.
1	Kiwi has been one of the worst travel experiences of my life. My flight was delayed 6 hours (not Kiwi's fault) but they never told me, they never contacted me at all to tell me about the delay! I found out later that the delay was announced by the airline at 10am. So since I didn't know I arrived at the airport at 4pm for my 6pm flight and was told in person it was delayed. Neither Kiwi or Norwegian air informed me of this ahead of time. (Also NEVER fly Norwegian air) When I got to the airport at 4pm for my flight I checked my bag (that Norwegian then broke the handle off of) and I called a Kiwi representative to re book my connection. She said she would work to get me a new connecting flight because obviously I would miss mine. So I left the airport and came back about 6 hours later. I did not get a single call back in this time. I tried calling them twice as it got closer but I just got a continuous busy signal. I finally get through after almost an hour, and I'm on the tarmac at this point, about to board. They still haven't found me a flight. 6 hours and they couldn't find me a flight! As I'm on the plane and we are about to take off I get an email saying I have 2 hours to call them back to book the flight. Guess what? I'M ON THE PLANE I CAN'T MAKE A FU**ING CALL. I immediately got yelled at by a flight attendant to put my phone away. So they give up the connection and they don't book it! Even though they knew I was on the flight, they had my flight info! Once I arrive in London I try calling them again. I called over 10 times, for literally 1.5 hours and NOBODY ANSWERS. So I go on the live chat feature on my cell phone's web browser, mind you I'm abroad, using my roaming, it cost me tons of money. The person I dealt with there was very difficult to understand and didn't seem to understand the situation. I asked to be booked on the flight I was offered when I got on the plane and she said it wasn't available. So I walked with my broken handle bag dragging it by a string to the Vueling kiosk where they told me they did, indeed, have seats. So I responded on the live chat that there were seats and only after that she rebooked me for the next morning. Obviously I had to stay overnight because the next flight wasn't out until 9am. So I booked the cheap hotel attached to the airport, which was basically my only option. I'm still waiting on the reimbursements from Kiwi for these additional expenses.
3	My first flight was delayed due to bad weather at the location of my first layover. I had to speak to many Kiwi agents on the phone and over the live chat, and most people weren't able to help me much (a couple didn't even seem to try very hard, and gave me some false or misleading information about the rebooking situation). That said, a few agents did genuinely try very hard to help me rebook my flights. In particular, Maria was able to get me new flights that worked so that I could still make my family's wedding in time (the whole point of the trip)! I am very grateful to her especially, and to the few other agents who did actually put in time and effort to try to get me to the wedding in time. I would give Maria more than a 5-star rating, and given all the stress and frustration caused the rest of my rebooking experience, I would give the company a 3-star rating overall. Be persistent if there's a flight issue that's not your fault, but no one seems to be wiling to help - one of the very helpful Kiwi agents might take on your case! In the end, thanks to Maria, the company was able to keep its word to rebook a reasonable alternative flight without extra charges. Thanks!
5	I book a series of flights with Kiwi - and there was a long delay with one flight causing me to miss my connection. The airline was not interested to help. But Kiwi got in touch and suggested that I claim compensation. They have been very helpful providing documentation to progress my claim - as I had not kept any. Very helpful guy called Eric gave me information and advice. Thanks very much
5	I'm very impressed with Kiwi's customer service, specifically the Chat feature. The service agent who helped me, Serhiy, quickly and efficiently solved my technical issue and immediately sent me new boarding passes. Very thankful for this feature, and knowledgeable agents like Serhiy!
5	I needed help for my boarding pass and Henry help me! Very gentle and quick!
1	"Good day,I am writing to say that while the agents are professional and friendly, the problem I have is with the actual processing of my requests.When I make a request for something to be changed on my ticket, it takes weeks to be done. The agent will say ""we will contact you within 48 hours"" but there is no contact made via email. Also, when I open the live chat to follow up on the request, they then say ""yes it has been handed over to another department"" but the request never gets processed. I have been waiting for changes to be made for more than 2 weeks and now I am considering calling to speak to a manager. I am very exhausted with the service being offered. I just need the changes to be made so I can have a good flight."
5	My flight from Las Vegas to London on Norwegian was one of the worst  flights I have ever had, in particular one really horrible flight attendant.  He was so mean and that whole experience was really bad.  I was determined that on my flight home I had everything in order including my choice of seats.  Jan, my customer service rep was so patient and kind in helping me get exactly what I wanted and she did this on Christmas Day - that's dedication for you!!! She really came through for me and I wish all my customer service experience was like with her.  She deserves a raise!
5	The 5 stars for Mardin Chudy.Here is an idea.If a flight is delayed by an airline your stuff should consider the earliest available flight. Because in some airports if the waiting time is more than 24 hrs then the passenger is required to purchase a transit visa. for some people it's challenging to get a transit visa. Or your stuff at least should have a little clue about the airport transit policies. Mardin, you are a professional and you made my day! Thanks a lot mate.
5	Mrs Hana,has been a fast and courteous help in correcting and completing my data for our family flight in April 2017 to Hongkong.Thanks againHeiko Hickethier
5	Really amazing site. Never had a problem during my travel. Once my flight was cancelled, I visited the live chat and there was one guy Bogdan which actually helped me a lot and did all to satisfy my needs. Thank you.
5	This service was a pleasure to use from start to finish. Easy booking. Quick response. No nonsense. No hidden cost. Price was excellent. I would definitely recommend Skypicker to my family and friends.
1	"I recommended that absolutely NO ONE do business with kiwi(.)com. I went to change a flight I booked to a new destination. I wanted to change the flight from Dublin - Edinburgh to Dublin - Inverness. I double checked the entry and made the selection for the change in airfare. When I received a confirmation email, the submission was incorrect. The timing was what I had selected, but the flight was still Dublin - Edinburgh. The website didn't correctly display Dublin - Inverness flights. I now see (based on the trust pilot reviews) that this issue has occurred to several people accessing their site recently. I immediately called to rectify the situation. I have since been told that the investigation shows that kiwi(.)com is not at fault and I am not going to receive either the correct flight or a refund.To boot, I can't go back and change my flight again to show the option I selected and take a screen shot the issue. I can only select a ""history"" button now. The bottom line is that I have been flying for 25 years and never experienced such an issue. Moreover, the problems I've had with Kiwi(.)com exceed the airline industry. In my entire life, I've never dealt with such a disingenuous and fraudulent company. I promise to fight them tooth and nail via credit card company, U.S fraud protection services, and the better business bureau to get my stolen money back. I recommend you all do the same. In the interim, I hope this message serves as a deterrent to people choosing kiwi(.)com.  The best we can collectively do is put these thieves out of business."
5	Using Skypicker significantly lowered travel cost. It is more complicated using Skypicker, but the savings and fast live-chat service really outweighted any extra time that had to be invested in understanding this in a sense rather new way of booking flights. More developed information on the web page regarding different scenarios and actions for the Skypicker guarantee, as well as a more thorough explanation of how travelling works when there is no luggage share agreement, would make things even better.Great job so far though, I'm a fan!
5	Excellent attention by Daniel, a very friendly guy who, despite being out off the hours offered to speak in Spanish, solved my troubles with the check in online. I am waiting to recieve my travel card by email,  I hope not too late. it was a pleasure, thank you very much for your help daniel!
5	Resolved my problem in 2 minutes. All thanks to very professional client support operator Natalia Petrishyna. Thank you!
5	Company as always provided excellent service!Manager Huri done all his best and solve my issue in a perfect way in really short time. Thank you very much Huri! All the best for you! I hope company will reward you for your work ! :)Sophia
5	Aamer was incredibly helpful with assisting me. He assured me that the booking confirmation will be taken care for. He also offered to follow up with a phone call as soon as the confirmation was done to reassure I've received my tickets and boarding pass. Very helpful and quick assistance from Aamer. Five stars!
5	Julia helped me a lot with a problem i had trying to book my flight.She checked everything and helped me a lot during the transaction.Also answered all my questions.Helpful and kind.Thank you very much Julia!
5	As my title say, everything perfect. No problem. The online chat 24/7 is excellent, they help you and resolve what you need so fast. The attention is excellent, with all the people I had to talk to were resolutive, friendly. Totally recommend it!. Thank you very much!
5	Need to change my depart date of my flight. Thank Patricia I. , Filip, and Marketa B.. You guys are great helps.
4	Thank you Bek for fast and effective assistance :)
5	I needed urgent help with my reservation, I was gonna lose 150 euros for not doing the check in on time (although they emailed me more than once) but thanks to the kind help of the assistan Tatevik, i could solve the problem in 10 minutes!Thanks kiwi and thanks tatevik!
3	@skypickercom is violating @IATA  rules in name of terms of service of <https://t.co/jLGZ1OGv9L>Please see into them IATA
5	After a stressful day of delayed and cancelled flights I spoke with Jan Stepan and he did a fantastic job at helping me figure out all my travel options and details. He answered all my questions and helped me find the best option for a new flight! Being a frequent travler I have spoken with a lot of airlines and travel agencies and this has been my most postivie expeince yet! I will definitely be using <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> again!  Thanks Jan!
5	I needed to print my boarding pass, since I'll be in Belgium from tomorrow, but I did't recive any email in the whole day.Emre helped me as soon as I logged in your live chat system, that is really innovative and useful to me!(I hope to get it soonish)Keep rockin'!
5	Always a great pleasure to receive support from these guys.

5	I've used Skypicker for the first time and couldn't be happier. Very easy to use and book trough the web site and when I needed assistance Eva P. couldn't be more professional and helpful trough the chat. Eva P. definitely impressed me with her customer service skills.
4	"The way how Skypicker reach the lowest prices is due to some algorithms which find ""special' flights. As a consequences, you can't amend flights directly with an airline. It means you won't be able to pre-order in-flight lunch, entertainment or any other options. Luckily, you can change baggage options.This is not a problem if you're specifically looking for low-costers and don't demand much. So, it fits their business.What was the problem (at least for us) is automatic check-in and seats allocation. Thanks to their live chat support operator Emre T. we managed to resolve the issue (although, as a friendly advise to Emre, please don't complain about time spent for resolving - this is your job and company's problems, not mine). The thing was the preallocated seats were bad and since we travelled as family, we were sitting apart from each other. While this is system which allocates seats, there should be an option for booking customers not to check-in automatically. Alternatively, they could provide a free seats changing service (now it's paid).Anyway, the company is young and it's pretty successful already. I wish good luck growing in the right direction and adding more useful features and flexibility. Once there, I would be happy to rate it 5/5.Best choice for random low-coster flight booking."
4	Big thank to Bek, lovely service,fast and reliable, highly recommended to avoid costly and unnecessary calls ;)
5	Thank you very much to Martin Curtin who assited me tonight.He was very professional, kind and cool.All the best
5	I didn't receive my e-ticket at once and had to ask for a resend. The online customer support was helpful and friendly and quickly got the problem solved.
5	Through live chat Jakub, this is his name, solved all my fears about my flights. He was amazingly helpful and I really had a great experience. I would definitely book again with <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com>. Thanks to Jakub for his kindness and good work and Tomas for helping me as well. All team 8, you guys are super stars :)
5	The KIWI website is easy to work with. The online chat possibility is great, I had a chat with a very friendly and knowledgable person named Martin Ch. He helped my immediately and adequately with a minor problem. KIWI IS CHEAP, FAST AND RELIABLE!
1	Absolute joke!!! Staff give conflicting information and when managers say they will take ownership of a problem, you never hear from them again! Lost count of how many different telesales operators I've spoken to, each time having to explain the issue! The actual airline even told us that the information this company give out is incorrect. Book at your own peril!!!
5	Customer service is great! They responded almost immediately via the online chat service. The representative that helped me --James-- was amazing and super helpful! Thanks Kiwi! -Linda.
5	"Everything was planned perfectly. And it is easy to use, the site automatically checks you in. I was with a group of people, our seats were next to each other, instead of ""filling in the blank spaces""Really a great service!"

5	After a 15 hour delay on an international flight I had the pleasure of working with Dorota, who was incredibly polite and friendly to work with. She found me the perfect alternative flight in a very short amount of time. Overall a very good experience, great customer service!
5	Daniel and Teona (sp?), where courteous and professional and made my stressful travel situation so much better.  Because of their customer service I will be using <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> for all my future travel needs, and I travel a lot too!  Thanks also to all the behind the scenes support crew too.  Job well done.
5	Fantastic customer support. Fantastic deals.I normally don't write reviews, but this company deserves it. They provide excellent customer support. The agent I spoke with, Eleonora C., and another man over the phone, were very kind and straight forward. I received a call late in the middle of the night as the company needed my passport details to confirm a leg of my flight. I didn't have my passport with me and the man on the phone told me I could email them or chat with them. He apologized profusely for calling me at such an hour and was extremely kind. I then went on their customer support chat and Eleonora was able to add the information. She also made sure I had received all the necessary documents for my flights and explained to me several times what I needed to bring. I then realized upon checking my email, another agent had already emailed me asking me about my documents. This company makes sure its customers are cared for. I would recommend this company for anyone who plans to fly anywhere. The deals are great and the support is fantastic. Just be sure to note that you cannot change your flight once they book it.
5	excellent attention and patience even though I do not speak English, thank you very much vlad I could solve my problem
5	I missed the flight from Rome to Paris, so I managed to find the cheapest flight on <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>. I purchased the tickets with my credit card, but soon I got an email that <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> needed to verify me to confirm the booking and asked me to call. However, for some reason, my tele-company didn't provided an international phone call and I tried to call through a public telephone, but didn't reach. So I searched how to contact them and I found that live chat was possible way to contact. In that way, I contacted <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> and Jan Lukasek answered me. She was really kind and nice. If she hadn't answered me, I would have been panic now. She was my life savor. Also, it was really great talk with her. She was thoughtful and had a excellent sense. If I were her boss, I would definitely promote her or raise her position. Thanks to Jan, I will use <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> again in future. Thank you very much!!No matter who her boss is, remember Jan Lukasek and give her a bonus!!
5	Your employers are so kindly esspecially Eoghan! He is the best! He helps me a lot with my stupid questions that I have :)
5	My first experience with Skypicker was great. They had an excellent offer on connecting flights to smaller airports (Tallinn, Riga, Milano) and offered best pricing. I made a small mistake when filling in the credentials of my travel compagnon, so I contacted Skypicker via the online chat. My problem was solved within 5 minutes and extra information was provided. Thanks Graeme Fairweather, superb service!
4	I want to give a huge shout out to Alikhan, who I spoke with on the phone. I made a mistake with my reservation, and Alikhan went back to the airline multiple times in an effort to help me re-book. He was incredibly kind and I really appreciated the extra effort.
5	<http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> provided me with quick response and assistance during my trip. when my flight was delayed, I just needed to chat with the representative and asked her new ticket. It was easy.
5	Monika Snowden and Yulia Volova represented the company really well by sorting out the problem with refund of money due to the problems with Ryanair tickets, where they did not allow me to fly because of apparent visa problem. They helped me to get a full refund very quickly, were very helpful and sympathetic to the situation and were generally a great pleasure to work with. Thank you and I would definitely use the services of this company again since the level of help is outstanding!
5	I called to change my passport number and Henry was so helpful. He quickly assisted me and asked if I needed additional help. He was kind and very courteous. I'll recommend this site to my fellow traveling friends.
5	I had booked a flight via Kiwi for LosAngeles to Copenhagen.For some reason, the flight schedule was not showing on the Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) website, and I was having a hard time finding the  schedule and gate number of the flight. I've contacted support center from Kiwi, and Sara (support agent), successfully helped me to find some hidden old website pages from LAX website, where the flight was actually shown. Saved me a bunch of time!
5	Great service, Bek and the staff are very helpful ! We had to change our ID numbers, couldn't find it on the website but the customer service helps me to do it. Great Service !
5	"I am so pleased with all the services I received from <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com>.  Dima K. was superb, professional, fast and genuinely nice to me.

I have been all over the world, have traveled extensively and I have never had better service from any other company. Five stars all the way.  I cannot praise Dima and <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> enough.  I will ""fly"" with them anytime, anywhere. Thank you Dima and Kiwi for making my dream trip come true at the best possible price.

Una atencion estupenda!!!!"
5	Lukas was very helpful and helped me arrange new flights after my flight to Boston got cancelled due to snow storm
5	I Love your company <3  Tickets are so cheap!
4	very courteous help and well informed. I would consider using this service again.
4	We were informed that SkyPicker would check-in to our flight for us and forward the boarding pass. We received a following communication that they were unable to check-in and that we would have to check-in at the airport. At the airport, the airline charged a fee for printing our boarding passes. We emailed SkyPicker making them aware of our circumstances and that we were displeased. Skypicker's support team was very responsive and is currently working through refunding us that amount. Although unhappy with the circumstances, we are happy with the customer service/responsiveness.
5	Mrs Ali was very helpful with me and ofer all the information I need it.
5	Our first flight got delayed so we Missed the connectings, we called <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> up and explained the situation and they helped us fast and with the best service Possible! Will definetly book with them again!
5	Thank you for helping me to insert the passport details in the sistem.
5	I always use Kiwi to search for flights, it is very easy and fast. The thing I like the most is that you can choose a country from where you would like to travel from and then see the prices to all countries on the map! It is really useful when you do not have an idea where you would like to go! I would like to thank Adrian for amazing service today. He resolved my issue very fast and efficiently. Please please make sure he gets a cookie for that :)
5	Lukas Kouril was very helpful and gave me all the information what I needed! Perfect communication! Thank you.
5	Booked,arrived, no problems, no complaints, learned a little Spanish, Gracias!
1	They were not able to sent me a boarding pass, not possible to call them - the line was busy, so I had to pay for chceck-in @ the airport extra money. Horrible, the company does not work.
5	My partner and I had a few issues with the route of our flight we needed changed; although this process takes a few days we wanted to find out if we could come to a conclusion earlier. I came across a lovely lady named Kristyna, from the customer service department, and she promised she would manage our booking from the point we called, and would find an alternate flight within two hours. An hour later, I was absolutely delighted to of received an in depth email from Kristyna regarding our flight change and other details; she also offered her advice on what would suit us best. We were pleased as this issue was solved quickly and did not cost us a great deal of money.Overall, I would recommend <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>. Kristyna went above and beyond to help us out and her professionalism was very helpful. This has been my first time dealing with kiwi and the greatest benefits are that promises are kept, there is friendly staff, written evidence and minimal hold times on phone calls.I look forward to completing my booking with Kristyna!
2	Start walking honey, they will drag it out until its too late and then deny responsibility. Friend me and join the merry band of skyfucking skypicker
5	For some reason my booking of 5 got split into two different refence numbers on a ryanair flight, where 1 in our group wasn't able to sign in. After being on hold for 15 minutes, I was connected to Ramon, who managed to solve the problem quickly. He was very helpful and friendly to talk to.
5	I had problems with printing my boarding pass. Anna Alaxinova solved my problem in a few minutes. She was very polite and patient. Really recommend an online chat for usage. Huge thanks to Anna.
5	Nice service and quick response to solve your question ! Very helpful !
3	Now i am in bank .taking request to block my credit card . Anyway i have one doubt remaining : how you will deduct balance from my card yesterday. Bcz i didn't make any transaction in your web site yesterday.
5	I went and got flight booked tonight great with the live chat. Been able to talk through everything with elena shostak people all my chat saved to and printed. bra. Got confirmation straight away and e ticket. Just fingers crossed everything goes well with flights... But the resurrance that I received from the company was good. so just have to wait now on my dad coming home. also reassurance that my dad recieve asstistance as he is a old man... flight caracas to edinburgh... time will tell.. finger crossed. x
1	"Wow. I made a big mistake booking with these guys. First, I failed to check the airline directly, and ending up paying about 20% more than the flight should have cost. Secondly, I didn't notice their very unusual policy: zero refunds for bookings; I contacted online chat minutes after making a purchase, and received a long, slow, repetitive series of ""sorry, our policy is not to refund."" This is really unusual in the airline industry. EVERY other place I've booked allows a 24hr grace period to say ""oops"" and cancel.  Additionally, I'm unable to check in online for the flight. So.... I'll have to wait until I'm in an airport 6 hours from home before I can check in and confirm my flight.  THIS IS NOT 21st CENTURY SERVICE.- PAID TOO much- POOR customer service- NON-STANDARD practices- INCONVENIENT travel situationAll in all, my trip has become stressful and uncertain due to buying from SkyPicker..... heaven forbid that anything goes wrong while traveling, like canceled or delayed flights, since it sounds like I'll need to make changes with these guys, rather than AirCanada. I don't have a good feeling about this.If I could tell everyone to avoid this company. I would."
1	We booked the flight last night. We were contacted by Kiwi this morning saying that they needed to verify the payment. The CS also said, if the price changed while confirming the payment, the charge will reflect the change. We were worried that we would end up paying a higher price. So I went to check the price on the website. It turned out the price was $200 lower. So I contacted kiwi to get the new price. At the same time, we were told that the booking was confirmed at the ORIGINAL PRICE! It's bad practice.
5	Wonderful experience and patient staff. I will definitely come back to book with Kiwi! And a shout out to Muhammad from Tunisia for his great help!
5	What we liked the most about SkyPicker is the wide range of options and the flexibility of the flight search there. Also we have to admit that the customer service was better that we expected. Bek was very friendly and answered all of our questions.
5	Fast to reply and very helpful. Support at its best!
5	He contactado con Skypicker via Live Chat y siempre son muy ambables y muy eficientes en responder a mis preguntas y resolver los problemas surgidos. Muchas gracias a Andrii G. por su ayuda!Thank you Andrii G.
5	OMG!!!!! Whoever is running this company knows what customer service is all about. I worked with a representative by the name of Filip to get a copy of a reservation that I just purchased and was still in limbo. Currently on my trip, I was a little anxious about a pending reservation. I was informed by Filip that it was still in process and that he would do his best to get the transaction rushed. He also assured me that I wouldn't need to worry about my reservations and that it takes a little bit of time to approve. Filip was kind, efficient and committed to great customer service.  There is a reason this company has high reviews. I will never shop for flights anywhere else.
4	Their customer service is A+ , as soon as a question came up they got in touch with me nearly immediately and assissted me right away. Thank you Petr for your help!
5	I'm very Glad with Alan Whitfield! Yesterday July 17 2016 help me a lot with all my doubts about my flight and my ticket flight.  I'm from México and He has been absolutely patient with me. I hope never change. Congratulations!
5	I had to cancel my trip, and they help me with all the problems I had with my travel cancellation insurance company. And they refound me the taxes of the flights. Thanks

1	2 times my ticket booking has been cancelled and another story of mine is that once 1 booking has been confirmed but with a mistake of one month distance in dates ,,,, i tried my best throughout the whole month but nobody helped me out and my money lost (( very bad experience of this company ,,, ive never seen a bad company as this is ....
5	It 's the first time that I use skypicker for the organization of a trip and found it magnificient.Punctual for reservations and for boarding passes and I promptly received answers to all my questions and my demands .Only one minor problem: it would be appropriate to ask the customer the kind of baggage that you are taking, to avoid any unpleasant surprises for boarding . For all the rest , excellent!I will recommend it.
5	Lenka was so nice and helpful at the live chat.
5	I needed help to change my flight, so requested by 'Patron Facing Chat'. Filip helped me so kindly and properly. Thank you :)

1	"Booking was easy enough. The interactive map is breathtaking. The price, however kept changing. As I searched options the price kept going up as I looked over it on their page! When I did decide on the flight I wanted they said it had gone up by almost twice due to the airline! OK. I cleared the cache and guess what: the price had fallen when I rechecked!Chalking it up to a bug, I said OK. Looking at reviews of Skypicker I decided to take the plunge. OK. Paying was seamless.This is where it gets a little exciting. Neither airline had any record of the flights! I had to email Skypicker, then the airlines had the reservation! Another issue, totally my creation. I misspelt the name of someone travelling with me. The airline said they cannot change the name as the reservation belongs to an agent. Skypicker is claiming that the airline wants €220 to change the name! In my currency that's almost TT$2000! That's just under 1/2 the cost of the entire vacation per person! Skypicker's wholesaler, Hahn Air, said the agency can do it for free, but Skypicker is still claiming that it is the airline that wants the €220! I know this was my mistake, but if Skypicker wants to make the extra profit say so!I will not be doing any more business with them. I do hope the vacation is without any more problems...Update: After this review somehow the ransom price fell. Now, however, they are claiming the second airline wants money for the name change at the airport counter. I have paid for the change on the first airline and have not heard back. Several live chats have said someone is waiting on a response from the airline. I'll update as this is done.Update (Sunday 22nd May): After quite alot of wrangling they are saying they have filed a complaint against the airline and are re-issuing the tickets. When asked about the extra payment, Lucie's exact words were: ""Agent 12:37 PM I cannot promise you anything right now."" Wow. Simply wow.Update (Monday 23rd May): Today they finally proved their lies. It seems Hann gave them the instructions on how to change the name, but they never followed these. Today, 3 days before the flight, they finally decided to follow the instructions. Because the flight is almost sold out the airline's fare went up by €2,122! They decided to refund the ticket cost and the cost to change the name they were claiming. At this last minute I am out the hotel cost and paid for ground transfers and tours.Do not, under any circumstances, use Skypickers or Kiwi or whatever next they decide to call themselves! I will be filing consumer protection complaints in the country of origin!"
4	Great service from Miquel Gudayol however I upgraded my luggage allowance (& paid for it) but never received a confirmation email so was unsure if it had been actioned. As a result I was unable to bring back any additional items as I was bang on my original limit. Other than that I would use again & recommend to others
5	I incorrectly input my passport expiration date into the system and saved it.  I called Kateryna at the US customer service line.  She not only corrected it very quickly but she followed up with a personalized email to confirm that she had made the correction.  That's all i could ask for.

5	Great customer service on the chat regarding flight cancellation! Leo in particular was kind and polite, and did everything he could to help me work out a solution. Still awaiting the result so not sure how it will work out. I would definitely book with kiwi again, particularly for the flight connection warranty!
5	I love this company. I only had a positive engagement with them. I would absolutely recommend them every time!
1	Kiwi sell a ticket with 1 stop. The stop is to short because flight is delayed more than 2 hours. Kiwi will not pay for the hotel, which is needed, because I cannot get a ticket to a new flight before next day. I'm now waiting for Kiwi to respond to my complaint.
5	Yuriy N. help me really fast, and was really polite, thanks alot for help.
5	I had an awesome experience with <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com>. They where so helpful and extremly service minded and I got help very quickly. And above all, they knew exactly the case I was struggeling with and with who i'd talked to the day before, so I never had to explain my story over again. Thank you so much Tomas and Jan S at <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> for such a great service. So grateful! :)
5	Skypicker has a most best customer service, I ever seen online. They do take care of all your troubles, till your`e safe to check in. .. Due of late night or was I too exited about a cheap tickets from Cologne to Porto, I did some wrong clicks about my gender and nationality. Then I took a try to change the passenger info, and so there was Phana online. She was very, very patient, and also very fast to get the things right! First she wasnt sure about all possibilitys, but still tried to do her best to calm me down. So and a few moments later~ my E*Tickets were suddenly right! My vacation over my Birthday to Portugal is now safe, thx to the quickest effort of Phana!
4	Very good service, wish to had the boarding passes on mob app
5	I´m a frequent flyer and I just booked a flight through <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com>. I´m very happy with their service, this time I mistyped my email address so I didnt receive the ticket.

5	Thank you so much for helping me out. I´d like to thank Tanya (I hope thats how you spell it) And Iurii Novgorodov for their exellent guidance. 4 Hours prior to my flight (which is now 3.5 hours away) I haddent gotten my boarding pass. It was probably my own  fault, but none the less, the amazing team at Skypicker helped me sort things out. Thank you yet again .
5	Excellent and more than satisfied!
5	I made a mistake on my booking, called kiwi, and Valy sort it out quickly and most importantly he was extremely kind...thank you
5	I just made a purchase for tickets online and neglected to add on the checked bags.  The process to add those on by Martin C., via chat, was superb and painless.  No issues with communication as he understood exactly what I was trying to do.  He even saved us a couple bucks.  Very pleased.
5	Very good support (chat)!! Thank you for the help!!
5	Everything went smoothly from booking to flight. All charges were clear with nothing hidden. The main reason I booked through <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> was because of their price - and no additional fees for using my credit card. I will use them again and will recommend them to friends.
1	I bought a flight from Tijuana to Milan through Kiwi for my son who is a minor. He is travelling with a special permit to exit the country without his parents.As soon as they arrived to the Tijuana airport they were told by the airline that the flight that I bought for july 7th (Y4822) was not even on their schedule!!  I had to put them in a different flight, otherwhise they would have lost their connecting flights...  when I thought everything was solved I went and checked the other 2 flights to see if they were on time.. AGAIN I discovered that the flight from Cancun to Milan (NO431) it's NOT schedule at 18:00 like my reservation..it's not even on the airport list of departing flights!  worried that it would be the same situation as the first flight I called the airline and they confirmed that the flight was and was always scheduled at 21:00 NOT 18:00 like my ticket said..  I NEVER received any notification from the airlines of any changes because they weren't any it was my reservation that was wrong...Now my son has to wait at the airport 3 more hours!!  since the flight schedule changed the information that I entered on the immigration permit now is wrong! so right now I'm at the other side of the world just hoping that my son is able to take the flight and exit the country.  I contacted kiwi and explained my problem by chat and they contacted  me immediately saying they would contact the airlines... wich I have already done. There is nothing they can do.. the airline flights schedule is different from what I bought.This is not about customer service, this is about the fact that I trusted their site to do a reservation just to find out that 2 out of 3 flights were WRONG! not schedule or scheduled differently. How can you offer a service that i'ts not even available?? Do you confirm with the airlines before selling the tickects? I WILL NEVER buy a ticket again through kiwi.. I rather pay more directly to the airline and be sure of what I am buying!!
5	I needed to make a last minute change to my booking, adding additional kg to my baggage.  Alexey Tudakov made this extremely easy, handling my issue in a most friendly matter and solved it efficiently. Really good job, keep on being great!
4	@skypickercom hi but the email is about printing boarding pass- I was told I will be receiving certain part of my refund:unamused:
5	Booked my Ryanair flights via SkyPicker - Ryanair web is awful, always have problems paying directly. The flight was cheaper than on Ryanair web (don't know how it was possible), and I was registered for the flight well in advance. Very good communication, they replied to my written request same day.
5	Very, very helpful. Alan (one of the Agents)did way more than he needed to do.Replied to me super fast and got in contact of the airlines etc.. Super Thankful. Great Job..
1	I booked a ticket for a friend,And 8 hours before the flight they send me an email that my reserve has been canceled because the credit card holder was a diferent person with the pasenger.
1	Skypicker defrauded me of over $1,000 US dollars. I purchased a flight from Miami to Durango Mexico with a stop over in Mexico City. Today in the morning when I go to check in for my flight I am told by the check in agent that only half of my itenerary is there, the connecting flight to my final destination was never processed and as a result 14 hours later and after 12 hours of back and forth with their customer service, I am told that they will not do anything therefore, I am stranded at the airport with my family with no tickets. I have booked hundreds of flights online with Expedia, cheap tickets and had never had this problem before! Stay away from Skypickers as they seem to be a shady Eastern European company defrauding people.
3	@skypickercom What is your contact number in Saudi Arabia and office telephones please
5	I had great service from Skypicker when I made a mistake on my travel documents information. I did the online chat and the service was very fast and friendly. They resolved my problem efficiently.

4	Issue with delayed bookings has now been resolved. Thanks for your patience and understanding during this time. Skypicker team
5	All good in the hood! Very good service and helpful staff!! I have to say Tomáš Jurík is the man!!!! As per usual I was late with check-in for my flight and he solved this within the minutes !!! Thanks again !!!
4	I have yet to embark on my trip, but there were two occasions where i needed assistance, & the two assistants (Alexy first, then Archil-who personally spent near an hour making sure everything was 100% satisfactory) were EXTREMELY patient and helpful. I have had an overall good experience with SkyPicker & would recommend them and use them again in the future.
5	David was my agent to help me to find a new connection to europe. He is an amazing helpful person. He was always really kind and could help me in a short time. Great Job David. He helped me so much and I really appreciated his hard work with the airline. I am more than just statisfied. Thank you David for your assistance which I just can recomande.
5	The customer service is excellent! Because i was served by Jana, she was very helpful and understanding! thankyou, so satisfied
4	I did not received the boarding pass for my daughter and after getting contgact they kindly support me for that. she ( Petya ) was very supportive and kind to help me. thanks a lot for your nice services.
2	Customer service is not good at all. Your reps don't understand English quite well (or so it seams) and thus they can be quite rude. Also, because of very personal circumstances (flight got cancelled in a very isolated region with no internet connection) so we arranged to forfeit the first leg of the flight and try to get to another airport to get an alternative to the missed connection. Well under EU regulations I can get the refund of that flight that in the end due to being cancelled I chose not to take. But you're saying I can't??  The airline at the airport itself informed me those are my rights. Appalling!!!
5	Kiwi is the best place to book flights
5	Daniel was awesome, he resolved my problems fastly and simply ! I couldn't expect a better person to do it ! Kiwi never disappoints me !!
5	Tanya just safe my day. Fast service and and nice people to have chat with.Thank you again!!
5	My flight was cancelled but the kind girl (Venda) from the help desk took care of my situation booking the most suitable flight. Great Service!
5	Melinda is very polite and helpfull. She helps me to generate my boarding pass and she explained anything about the procedure.
5	they solved a problem with my online <http://check.in|check.in> procedure. Cheap flights. Michael Angelo helped me over the chat
5	Thank you dear Filip Ralevski and Aame Tageldin for saving my son Christmas . It was like a nightmare when i found out that the flight we booked to Sharm elshek Egypt with Air Cairo has changed it's destination to Horgada . Now we have  been replaced with a new ticket so Adam can see my mama . God bless you and And all your colleagues that been working on my case today Merry Christmas everyone .
5	Jan S. was fast and very helpful thank you!
5	Fantastic experience founding a different and economic route as I did by hand first.
5	Lucie has answered all my questions patiently and gave me her recommandation. I really appreciated this.
4	I was assisted during my transaction by Lenka, and she did a good job. She helped my out in a clear and polite way. Thanks!
3	Please check the reviews of this company before you use them - they are scammers!!!
5	Thanks for all the help for the customer service clerk's Tomas Jurik, David Pinto, Silvia Ochrankova, Ksenia and NinaHave a nice day u all!
5	Excellent service!!My flight was delayed and I was very worried that I'd miss my connecting flight. Mario was very quick to find a suitable flight change and everything turned out well in the end.I'm very grateful. Thanks a million Mario!Olivia
5	I have had a very pleasant experience. Lukas P, very kind and helpful Customer Support helped me to resolve all the issues very fast, within 2 minutes. Thank you Kiwi, for employing such professional people!
1	I contacted <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> before my journey to ask about travelling with two bags. They decide to get back to me at the last minute while I am still in Morocco, to tell me that I have to give 48 notice to the check in, if I want to check in extra luggage. Of course this time had passed, and I only had 12 hours left. I was told in the email, that I would not be able to check in my luggage if it was not done in this time. I responded to their email, but one week after my email, I still receive no response. I shall be reporting them the trading standards and to the CEO. As a consequence, I paid £120 to ship my clothes back home via DHL and I still have to pay £18 for customs, I'm sure you can only imagine how angry I am. I will be filing for a full refund of my monies spent.To add insult to injury. I get to the airport and they ask me if I want to check my bag in for free! LividI will sing like a canary until I get my money back... trust me, this is one woman who will not stop until I get my money back!
1	Worst travel agency i have ever dealt with.Booked my flight but did not receive an e-ticket. Called them up,  but was told there's nothing they can do. Decided to cancel my booking.I Emailed 3x now asking about my full refund, & no reply yet.
5	Booking with <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> was cheaper, simple and reliable. I was late to fill in my travel documents info, but I contacted Dominika on chat here and she helped me to avoid any trouble. Many thanks!
1	Very fraudulent website, be very aware of them , we booked flight in nzd and they charged us in usd when it was VERY clearly not , we r trying to get refunded but communications lines are shutting and we keep getting our emails bounced back !!!! We r out of pocket $300 dollars because of these crooks , please share and let people know !
5	So I just had to get a bunch of things sorted, have less that 48 hours to do so and I could not check in online, needed more KGs for my bags, had visa questions. Not gonna lie, I was dreading having to do this alone with out the help of my flight director. But used their chat function and then BAM! Neil to the rescue, I have never had a more pleasurable experience with an airline employee before. The girls in the office always say how much they love working with Kiwi and now I have got to experience it myself and totally get it.  I got my KGs, sorted the Visa stuff and I am 100% checked in for my flight, and I know I would still be on hold with any other airline out there! Thank You Kiwi for being you! And thank you Neil for being so awesome, even after freaked out a bit, you kept it cool and made me laugh in the end!100% would rebook with them again!
5	Selorm has been really really really helpful ! Great guy and lots of patience ! Cheers dude
5	service is very good provided by Martin Carter
4	Michaela was very friendly, efficient and helpful on the online chat forum when I needed to update my details for my flight. Thanks so much for helping s holiday start well :)
5	Thanks to Maria from Slovakia , she help me with my booking. I was messing some digits from ID cards , but with her help everything is ok. Thanks again!
4	@skypickercom No reply by email but Anna took my call really well. Hope the day is getting better for you all ;-)
5	My friend and I booked a trip for the summer through Skypicker. We were having some issues receiving our payment link for reserving seats. Fortunately, I was able to find a 24/7 live chat on Skypicker's website. Michaela was really helpful and responsive, and we were able to quickly resolve our problem!I'm incredibly impressed with the level of customer service I've gotten. Special thanks to Michaela! You're awesome (:
5	The reservation was done quickly and easily. The payment went without problems. Tickets arrived at the moment. We experienced a trouble-free trip.
4	We appreciate that apart of the destination information, more information of the airport such as facilities offered, departure arrangement and etc could be very much needed to better plan passenger's time especially when passenger just have limited time to transit.We were flying from Beijing China, transiting Hong Kong to Malaysia. Flight from Beijing was delayed for about 30mins but we believe we are still able to catch our next connecting flight from Hong Kong within 2 hours. After arrived at Hong Kong Airport, we proceed to check-in but we didn't realise we need to take 3x transit express to our boarding gate where time is so tight for us.
4	thanks to lucile about changing the flight a few hours before i paid a little more but better than lose the fly
5	Had a problem with my internet connection whilst completing the booking. There customer service department was extremely helpful
5	Friendly service and great prices! Skypicker made my journey to 3 countries to Europe a pleasant one. Apart from their friendly reminders and E tickets in a easy to read format,  I even got to take Fly Emirates back to New York with such a great price bundle!
5	I wantec to add board luggage and contactd KIWI by chating and the additional booking porocedure was done plentsly chatting. When KIWI informed me about the additional cost, i stepped back from my request and KIWI asked me what ever else they could do for my and issued instead already the board card for various airlines.
5	Miss operator Dorota was very helpful and professional. Helped me to solve the situation very kindly, fast and into my 100% satisfaction.Thanks once more, all the best*Marek Polanecký, 8.10. 2016, Siracusa, Sicily.
5	From start to finish all details were easy toarrange/understand and flights were a breeze.Overall excellent experience. :-)
5	I started a chat and within minutes my problems with the tickets were solved thanks to Tamara
5	"Customer Service is phenomenal. Live chat is super useful. The company is clearly well organized, provides unbelievably low prices and amazing opportunities. I'm constantly on the website searching for great deals. As a young traveler on a budget, the search ""Anywhere"" allows me to find the best travel deals. I've even used the site to search flights in Africa. Always had great experiences with both of my international trips."
5	I spoke with Michael on the phone about an issue with the payment and he was amazing! One of the best agents I've spoke with. He handled everything so smoothly and professionally, also was really patient and kind with me when he gave me the information about the follow up on my case.
5	Dear Kiwi!I would like to thank you for your help with my flight issues I had yesterday. I was contacted trhu to Melinda Iványi, she was very kind and helpful with me and solved my problem in no time. I would like to thank her for the kindness.RegardsGabor Windt
4	Their customer service was really great i got helpt from a lovely girl named Clara, and thankfully she was really nice and calm with everything and helpt getting everything sorted out. Thanks Clara
5	I cannot say enough great things about kiwi! First off, they saved me close to $1500 through 2 connecting flights. Second, they added luggage and checked me into my flight (emailed boarding pass to me also!) with zero hassle. And when I called their helpline the man was very friendly! I was close to missing my connecting flight (not kiwis fault, the first airline was slow in getting luggage to the baggage claim as I had to recheck it), but in the end it ended up working out. And with their guarantee I know it wouldn't have been a problem to rebook a flight with them had I missed it. I will absolutely be using them and recommending them in the future!
5	Not flown yet, but Jan in customer service was quick and efficient and was very helpful in confirming my insurance details. Hopefully all goes well with my trip in a couple of weeks.
5	Easy booking process, quick in responses
5	As many others, I was also a bit skeptical about using Skypicker because of the different reviews  that one reads about it. Truth is, everything went extremely smoothly. They kept me updated about everything, sent me emails with the electronic tickets and then every time a check in became available they checked me in automatically and I received the boarding cards by email. It was amazing. I didn't have to do anything but print out the boarding passes and enjoy the flights. My trip included two flights both ways with Ryanair and Wizz Air, but there were absolutely no issues. Thank you Skypicker and I would absolutely recommend it to anyone. Well done :D
5	Alice W has offered me high quality support in live chat.
5	great and quick help from Albert Martey by changing booking details online! Thanks a lot!
1	We booked three flights with Skypicker to take us around Peru.We turned up to the airport 2 hours before our scheduled departure time for the first flight and were told that it had already left!The flight time had been changed a month previously, and though the airline said they had sent an email to Skypicker, we were never told this information.We had to book alternative flights, and Skypicker are currently refusing to refund us the value of these flights, despite the fact that we could not arrange another flight for that day with the original airline.To make matters worse I asked them to check the times of the subsequent flights, and they gave me the wrong time for the second flight as well! Thankfully we turned up at the airport 3 hours early so still made this flight, however we have received no apology for them sending us incorrect information about two of our flights.
5	The customer service was very helpful, i had some misunderstanding about the boarding pass, but Neil did explain it to me very well.Great service
5	Had no problems with anything even upgrading my luggage allowance was trouble free and easy to do
1	awful costumer service, if you make a mistake booking your flight or need to change anything your money is gone.
5	Having used Skypicker for the first time,I am very impressed with the ease and the price I obtained on two flights from Genoa to Edinburgh.Will now definitely use this facility in future for all my travel.Happy Christmas and a Good New Year to all.
5	Worked with a rep called David who provided excellent help with my booking.Would recommend to anyone
4	I found customer service to be very helpful. I had a query regarding my itinerary and Sophiya Gerasimova replied right away with the everthing I needed to know.
5	I had an issue with the seats allocation for my four flights and I spoke with a couple of operators apparently not very enthusiastic to solve the issue.Then I chatted with Mr. Emre of the customer service. He stayed with me on chat for more than one hour in order to solve the issue and finally he solved it with professionalism and great customer care skills! Thank you.
5	I have to congratulate your company for having employees such as mr. Pavel Fridrich. I have needed some extra-assistance concerning some flight tickets and it surely would be impossible to find someone more helpful and solution-oriented than mr Fridrich. I can truly say that I am grateful for having cooperated with him so well on all my flight aspects to which he has found the best solutions. I will surely recommend SkyPicker to everyone I know – and this is thanks to mr. Fridrich’s amazing professionalism!
1	I'd previously never used <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> before - I usually use eBookers, who are GREAT, I've never had any problems with them.Unfortunately eBookers didn't have the flight times available that I wanted, So I tried <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>, due to the pretty good reviews.It was a disaster.They took my booking, took my money, then I got an email saying:'We regret to inform you that your booking has been declined as a result of our standard security validation.'I called their customer service, and I was told that their security check is being a bit sensitive lately, they have a bit of trouble with it.Then why the hell did they accept my booking and take my money if they know there is a problem?They should close their offices until it's fixed, NOT take bookings that get rejected.I was told they have refunded my money and it may take up to 10 days for the money to go back into my bank - but more than likely it will only take a day or two.Well, that was 15 days ago and I see no indication of a refund in my bank at all.This is my first and last time I will have anything to do with them.It's a pity that I still have to deal with them just to try to get my money back - I feel soiled.Do yourself a favour, avoid these idiots and use eBookers.
5	Je suis plus que satisfaite.
5	@kiwicom247 thanks for your reactivity, message sent :)
5	Everyone was super helpful and friendly, and they handled my case very quickly, which is nice because you've already got enough stress arranging your trip, last thing you need is problems with customer support. Highly recommended!
5	Very impressed with the help and service. Thank you very much (Jan S.)Made things simple and easy to understand for me. Brilliant service.
5	I needed to make some changes on travel dates. So, I rang Skypicker office and received professional attention until the changes were effected. I am more than happy with their service level and couldn't ask for anything better.
5	The airline had to cancel our flight because of renovation of the transit airport.The Kiwi.com-Staff is real helpful and sympathic. We had a lot of questions and Kristina and the Staff helped us in really everything!I think, if you book a journey and everything works fine, than everything works fine. You only can valuate a service in the moment of a problem. And <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> is a real fantastic trouble shooter. Very smart and very fast. Thank you!
1	After paying for the tickets, the company wanted 1/3 MORE of the total price that we paid. We said no, and now have to wait 10 days for our money. They can take our money in 2 hours, but it takes them 10 days to pay them back. Is this even legal? I mean... the deal was closed, and they had already taken our money. Just don't.PLEASE NOTICE: my account here, at Trustpilot, has more than one (..!) review, and I have a picture. I am trustworthy.
5	Very quick and helpful resolution of problem with filling in passport expiry date on-line - Joshna was able to  take and update my details on the phoneThe call was answered quickly tooBW, Anna George, Bristol
5	no problems at all. The automatic check-in is also pretty convenient.
5	The customer service by chat is excellent, very fast and effective! Eugene attended me tonight and was very helpful, he made my confirmation and ticket arrived.
5	HiWe had made a mistake in our reservation but Gabriela K was a very big help to us today to get it fixed.Best regards
5	Non ho FB, ma ho chiesto supporto a una mia amica per scrivere la recensione.Ho avuto problemi con il check-in online e ho chiesto aiuto alla chat in tempo reale. Mi ha risposto Pavel che è stato gentilissimo, molto cordiale e molto efficente risolvendo il mio problema! Utilizzerò ancora skypicker!
5	I made a reservation, but my email was in the end wrong, i asked for help and it was super quick the answer and problem solved.I appreciate a good costumer service. Thank you.
5	Thank you to Mr. Owen Wilson, hope I have your family name right, for assisting me from beginning to end for my booking requirements and resolving immediately with much ease my payment problems due to tech glitches. Indeed service quality excellence seen in your courtesy and sense of urgency and efficiency was indeed exceptional and commendable.

5	Stan was very helpful to me and quickly answered all my questions. Thanks to him, I am not worried anymore and know all I need before my flight!Thanks kiwi for excellent customer service!
5	Tomas , who was promt and 100% x) , helped me update id/passport details in a matter of minutes! Great service ,great website!
2	A startup that finds discount flight tickets 'hidden' on airline websites just launched in the US <https://t.co/k6kPiSyRLj>
5	I had to get any informations about changing my flights.  David P. worked hard to find different possibilities for me, He did it with the less time possible, always with a politness and comforting attitude.  I had to talk to Michal and Jana too, and they all are responding well to my questions and I felt secure. I knew that If I needed help, they would do the best they could.  Great service!
1	"I trusted these so called ""travel agents"" with the prices they displayed on their website and bought my ticket to fly back home. Within the next couple  of days I receive and email saying that they had technical difficulties and unfortunately they weren't going to be able to get me on that flight. 4 days later i still do not have that money in my account and the bigger issue is that i contacted them right away and wouldn't tell me what the ""technical difficulty"" was nor where they able to rebook my flight and honor the price they had guaranteed. Conveniently enough, they were so willing to rebook my flight but this time for more the double the price they had guaranteed the day I originally purchased my ticket. And all for ""technical difficulties"" that they couldn't explain."
2	2 Stars: Poor - an inadequate experience with a lot of friction.Here's why: the trip was a bit more complicated than most, because I'll be bringing a bike on the plane, and I need to pay for it at least 2 days ahead of time accordingly to Kiwi's policy. At first it seemed like everything was going to be taken care of quickly and easily, but there were too many mistakes made along the way which added a lot of stress to the trip. Don't get me wrong, all of the people I talked to were very helpful, but paying for the box required at least 10 phone calls, and a half dozen e-mials. Way more than it should have taken. Just my opinion for future improvement: the link to pay for 'Additional Services' shouldn't expire after 24 hours, and if it has to that should be clearly written somewhere. That expiring link added a lot of hassle.
5	easy to ask something thank to the chat system and operations are very kind. Thanks a lot Lenka and Mario.
5	Hana was fantastic to help me change my flights on live chat.  Thank you Hana, you were such a help!
5	Awesomest experience ever ! I had so many questions regarding my booking and  a chat rep Pavel F made the whole process so easy and unbelievable for me. He stayed connected through the booking and kept giving me updates regarding my reservation. He readily had all information and this booking was done with great ease. I would recommend sky picker to all !! Keep up the work.
1	Totally a horrible experience. I bought a couple of tickets with <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> and I was left with nothing but trouble. First of all i bought a ticket worth 80€ only to find out one hour after my initial confirmation that my booking didn't go through. Then when i went to book the exact same ticket, the price has rissen to 100€. No support agent could explain why to me, or reimburse med the 20€During my trip i booked another flight with Kiwi, which was cancelled. The price was again 100€, which i gladly paid. Then when my flight was cancelled, at the airport I was only able to get a refund of 50€ as the rest was a booking fee. Basically Kiwi charged me double the price of what everyone else paid for the same ticket. It has taken <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> more than a week to process my complaint, and they still can't refund me any money. Stay away from this scam
5	"As someone that travels a lot, Kiwi has been really helpful for me in figuring out flight connections to minimize cost and inconvenience. The website really makes it simple, and the radius search feature is a godsend. On top of all that, their customer service is fantastic. They've contacted me on their own when some information was missing from my booking, even though I don't think they should be obligated to do that. And when I had a question about a cancellation, instead of trying to screw me over with a ""sorry too bad"" like most online/corporate travel agencies, they actually took the time to explain to me what could possibly be done about it. I'll continue to recommend Kiwi to friends and family until I've got a reason not to. Thanks Kiwi!"
5	Pavel Burian was extremely helpful during the online chat.
5	Their online chat service is really good, Radek, the person who help me was very nice and solved my problem in just a few minutes, excellent customer service.
5	Excellent customer service. My thanks to Tomáš Jurík who helped me out and found a mistake in my reservation which could me cause problems at the airport.
5	Very good agency. I m very happy because i found a very good route with them and very cheap also. The staff is very helpful. I had the pleasure of speaking with Tamara , a very lovely lady which provided me with all the information i needed :). Very interesting system of booking....They are checking you in with no extra cost !!! They are providing you the boarding passes by email .....They are very kind....They would even park your car at the airport if this would be possible through the internet :))).  I highly recommend them :) .
5	thank you Youssef for your kind help :) and for the speed and accuracy of your response !
5	Nina was very helpful when I made some inquiries about my trip to Lombok. Happy to recommend both her service and <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> to friends.
5	We had to change baggage allowances for the return flight but were unable to do it since the check-in was already performed. We used the on.line chat support and the result was impressive. Not only they replied very fast, but they completely resolved the problem. The agent (Mario Zarsky) was really nice and managed to resolve what turned out to be a rather complicated problem with the flight company. He produced a link to the flight company in the chat from which we could immediately perform the operation. Mario did not leave the chat until everything was resolved. Moreover, at the next day we found other problem with a boarding pass of another of the flight companies, and used again the chat support. The result was also wonderful. Another agent (Radek Navratil) answered immediately and managed to fix the pass, that we received by email in a matter of minutes. Overall the experience with the chat was extremely good.
5	I had a mistake in names on a boarding pass, probably it was my mistake, and Eduardo P. had helped me so much, thank you and all team of <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>!
5	Leah did a great job assisting me. Needed to add a lap child to my existing booking.
1	I'd like to cancel the my husband Osaka - Incheon ticket,but I cant that is no cancelation button.And I don't want to reservate on <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> never!
5	From the moment I booked my flight I received the confirmation and all the necessary information promptly in my inbox. Also, some days after, when I needed to check if it was still possible to change the flight return date and the costs involved I just made a phone call and in some minutes I had a reply again in my mail, as requested by me. A very good service for me.
5	I had some trouble with delays getting my passport, and had to do a reshuffle of my booking, moving bag allocations and getting some boarding passes ahead of others, but Kiwi got it all sorted with no issue at all!I was served by Radek and suffice to say this was probably the best customer service I've had in my life - I'm no stranger to these services and can be a real pain but Radek was fantastic, he was very professional and no issue was too complicated. He chased up with Ryanair to tweak the booking and emailed with a full resolution later the same day. I couldn't possibly recommend his and Kiwi's service more highly.
5	Good response and friendly ,detailed information. Thank you
5	Adding a child to my booking during a weekend is not obvious, especially with those cheap and never available airlines! The Kiwi team made it seemless to me! Great experience, thank you very much Nastasia G., Kristina B. and Markéta G.! Great stuff, just got it how much difference it is to book with Kiwi as opposed to booking with the airline...
5	Prompt and thorough response to my questions by your consultant, Anastasia Arkhipova.
4	I am very pleased with the service and support from Mr Vitalii Nikitin.He helped me very quicky and with kindnes and patience.Its very good and high qualifield person.
5	very fast and helpful answer
5	I needed to change typing error in reservation, we have to do check in few hours, on online chat I've met two ladies - KAREN and JANA - they helped me out in prompt,professional way and my problem was solved in few minutes. Thanks
5	I booked a ticket for my parents from Vietnam to Melbourne via Skypicker, and my outbound flight got delayed due to the airport's problem. I couldn't contact the airlines to ask for help so i called Skypicker support team. My situation was really stressful cause my parents' visa required them to arrive to Melbourne by the next day. They have been so supportive & fast. They paid a lot extra money for alternative tickets for my parents, and we didn't need to pay any thing. My parents arrived on time. Really appreciated that. Best agent ever.
4	Have used Scyscanner previously!Can see how much better and in many times more affordable flight!Well done!Congratulation
5	An excellent choice in case you want to safely travel from A to B and get the best provider. Maria Potello serviced me perfectly well so I managed to come to the place on time nevertheless it was a mess with tickets first. Thank you for your kind service and help, really appreciate it!
5	Thanks to Juan Costa. He was very helpful and highly efficient.
3	Has anyone ever used Skypicker?
5	Booked my first ticket with them, needed to add a piece of luggage last minute and Michael was a great support in fixing this! also, there was a tech issue and it seemed I could not check in and he immediately fixed that too. I look forward to taking more flights with them now :)
5	Many thanks for your great service Serhii Kiian and your team!
5	I am flying to Morocco tomorrow but I have to fly through France. Unfortunately, there is an air strike tomorrow in France but it's supposed to take place after my flight. I noticed that I received all my boarding passes except for the one leaving from Paris to Marrakech. I reached out to Kiwi via the 24/7 live chat. Daniel (the rep who helped me) quickly assisted and informed me that my flight should be OK. He reassured me that should I run into any challenges with the airline to contact Kiwi immediately. After a few minutes, he was able to secure my additional boarding pass for Marrakech. Fingers crossed that my flight does not get cancelled but I appreciated Daniel's quick assistance with getting me what I needed in the interim. Excellent customer service and I will be using Kiwi again to book future flights.
5	Excellent service. Bek was  our agent and helped us. Im very satisfied :)
5	I HAVE JUST TALKED TO OLGA AT THE COSTUMER service and i want to say that she was amazing!!! amazing service! perfect woman! thank you very much
5	I was worried on the fact that I didn't notice the flight I reserved had no Checked luggage. I was about to cancel since the price for the extra bag was way more expensive. However after Martin helped me, he found out at least he could get me a better rate for the extra luggage price or something like it.I don't have a resolution yet, but since Martin owned the problem and tried to gave a solution to a problem that was my mistake, to say the truth, I felt comfortable and apprecciate by <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>It was great they could give me a hand.
5	I was so desesperate looking for a great deal so I used kiwi chat for some help, so this man named Jan Lukasek which is an Agent from Kiwi that help me lots! Even if I wasnt sure about my destination this Agent help me to find my affordable prices explainind me about my checked baggage which i was worried about. I really like Kiwi, I didnt know about this website before, Kayak send me here by booking there so, My experience was great!! Ill be back for further flights.
5	I was helpled through a online chatroom with Juan Costa. He did a wonderful job helping me with the flight information I was confused about. Quick service with and he is a pleasent representative.
3	@skypickercom review???? Result is the same 2 hour layover = 2400 out of pocket. Never again. Substandard service. Skypickerfail

5	I got a email problem, they answered on the chat under 5 min after my call. Problem solved in less than 5 minutes.
5	Just booked with them for the first time and I am satisfied with the ease of the booking process. My trip is this upcoming monday March 21, 2016 and I hope everything goes well.
5	Started off very nervous. Not a world traveler.  I was worried about all of the stops.   I decided to call one week before for details and more info. I was hold for quite sometime and became more worried.. Until Eric picked up the phone.. He stayed on with me an went over every detail i was worried about..   He was so kind and wonderful. He went step by step with me..    I have never had such amazing customer service ever..  Please please thank him for me!!  I now can not wait for my trip.  I know if i have a problem i will get excellent service.. Many thanks, Colleen
1	Booked tickets in AUD and my statement reflected $40 overseas transaction fee. The bank confirmed it is because the transaction was done in another currency. Including this fee the fare price became higher then other suppliers and the blame is now on the bank that they charged the fee. Worst service and worst after service. Should have read these reviews before going ahead.
4	For choosing and finding the best flights is the best site I have ever found. I took quite a while to the get the boarding passes but at the end service was great and finally sent them to me on time.
5	I was missing my confirmation number. After talking and emailing with 3 different agents. I have been struggling to find my confirmation email for a purchase I made. Until Saskira helped me through Live Chat, she was such a helpful person! I thank her so much for all her help because I felt like she really wanted to get things cleared up. I was so happy after she resolved my problem because I have been trying to fix it for over a month. Thank you again Saskira!
5	Even though the information of the tickets invoice and booking numbers are somewhat unclear and force me to use the live chat customer services. But I really amazed by the help of customer assistant Michael and for the high-speed and extremely kind attitude. I really appreciate it.
5	a great team, great staff, fully grateful for all the help given! always very attentive and polite! Thanks again Aurelija ...
5	Had to query then add some baggae items to bookings previously made with <http://Kiwi.co|Kiwi.co>, Monika K advised and facilitated a painless and easy transaction.Many Thanks Monika K, and <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>
3	Learn how @skypickercom offers tickets for flights up to 90% less with the help of a cloud-based ticketing portal. ≡ <https://t.co/uAcckbOHFr>
5	Customer service was a fast, friendly and managed to resolve my issue with my check-in in a couple of minutes without any hassle or problems. Special thank you to Eric for offering me the best customer service that I had in a long time.Really good management and efficient way to resolve issues.I will be buying flight tickets from Kiwi more often.
5	Filip was really nice and helped me with a query i had.
5	Last night my daughter called me from Sicily (i am in Nashville Tennessee USA, it was after midnight my time)  frantic that she could not get her debit card to work to purchase a ticket from Sicily to Malta. She asked me to purchase a ticket on Kiwi for her.  The booking was easy, but in error i clicked the wrong time for the flight.  I immediately got on Kiwi chat and Rebecca C. was able to help me get the flight changed with no worries.  She went the extra mile,  Many companies would have asked me to wait for the original booking to come through and then to change it myself most likely with a processing fee.  Rebecca certainly exhibits high appreciation for KIWI customers.  I will certainly recommend and use this company in the future,Very grateful,Sandy M
5	Mr Romain Rouchet has help me a lot with my reservation . Thank you
5	Great live chat service... Youssef was Quick and concise, thanks
1	I booked one way ticket Vietnam to S.Korea. But unfortunately I mis-check my date 12->11. I mailed immediately about that, and they explain how to change flight date, I was so thank you. But If I want to change date than I'll have to paid same price as the new booking fee. It means If I want to change my date I have to book again. Also, they say no refund. So, I visited Viet-Jet website and I found that Viet-Jet Promo price is cheaper than SkyPicker price, and Viet-Jet Promo include change flight date service(only pay exceed amount about original price not same price as the new booking!). It's same ticket, but price and service are totally different. I really regret why I didn't find carefully. My first language is not English but I'll try to explain what I've been through. Thank you again SkyPicker. I'll go to book new flight ticket in the other website.  -Mis, CHO
5	Took me 25 mins to get through but Eric Ropars could not have looked after my problems better.
5	When I booked I forgot to write my whole name and sometimes you get trouble on the Emigration office. So I wrote the Customer service and they fixed it in a hour!Thank you for your friendly and excellent service!
1	We experienced a flight delay>12h and we thought we would get most of our expenses paid through the insurance, since we had to pay plane tickets to connecting flights for three people, hotel room and food. They didn't cover anything. They're the worst company ever! Don't book your flights through SkyScanner and don't think about purchasing the insurance! It's a fraud!
4	I asked several questions of Jan and she answered them all satisfactorily and provided me with extra helpful information!  She was very prompt and precise!
5	Johnathan in the call centre was great - thanks for your help :)
2	I would NOT recommend Skypicker for someone with children or special needs. If you are a flexible person that only values low costs you could give it a try. Lets say that I payed a low price for the ticket, but on the cost of flexibility, comfort and most of all; Security.My problem was that my tickets wasn't available until hours before the departure. I had to call Skypicker on both the way to and way back from my holidays. At 18:00 the day before my return I called Skypicker to ask where my ticket was. I was told that my ticket wasn't ready yet, even though I had to leave for the airport around 04.00 the next morning. This really creates problems and insecurity when you are in vacation and in need of an internet-café or something similar to print your ticket. Later, after midnight, I received an email that said that I wasn't checked-in. I saw this first at the airport which of course created a bit of panic.Everything turned out just fine, but really in the last minute! I would never risk to fly with them again, most of all if I wasn't alone. Imagine this stress having a child with you when this kind of things happens... I also had to exit the second airport to recheck-in during my transfer. Lets say that I payed a low price for the ticket, but on the cost of flexibility, comfort, security and panic. This is not an optimal travel company for non-flexible persons since YOU have to remind THEM to give them the airplain ticket you've payed for, which you will receive just a few hours before departure. Everything you have planned for 6 months happens in the last minutes. This is my experience anyway.
2	Oh on mail I was said it was done twice and on the phone Lukas said it was 4 times and now it's 3? And then I was told you guys will deduct the apparent transfer fee paid by you'll from my refund despite me giving you all account details and your team again makes a mistake by transferring it with wrong details just like how the ticket had wrong details printed on it?Do you wanna make up your mind? It's been like 5 months but this seems to just go on and on!
5	I had a problem with my passport number. Everytime I sent an email I had an answer within a day and my problem was solved like this in 2 days.Good job!
5	I had a few problems checking in but the customer service I recieved from Jakub was truly outstanding. He fixed everything via live chat. He is an excellent member of the Kiwi team. Thank you
5	Thank you very much for helping us to check in online. Denis was very kind and helpful.
5	Skypicker got me from Hobart to Dublin via Sydney for a couple of days with 3 different airlines! I had no problems at all, very easy and cheaper than anyone else by 50%! Will definitely be using again and will recommend to everyone! Thank you very much skypicker
4	Skypicker is very good service. Most impotant, that i book flight and go away.
5	I booked a cheap flight USA to Portugal with Skypicker and couldn't be more surprised with the quality of costumer support. One of my flights was cancelled by the airline and Skypicker contacted me to arrange for an alternative. Not only were they really responsive and helpful, I was travelling with my partner who had a separate booking and Skypicker was really helpful with making sure we were on the same flight after the initial cancellation. Definitely recommend!
5	No problem at all booking my flight. I will use it again
5	Website of <http://skypicker.com|skypicker.com> help me to find cheap air tickets between Ostrava (OSR) ---> Dusseldorf (DUS) and back. Quick and clear order. Specially thanks to Ivana V. (I hope, that I didn´t mistake in her name), who answered me on some questions.
1	"A few weeks ago I booked a flight through Skyscanner who (as they do) redirected me to one of their partnered websites - <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>. The flight I booked was - London - Hong Kong - Bali - Maldives - London - and had various layovers in transit between.Heading off for the final leg of my trip, coming home today I get to Male (Maldives) airport and am told that because my flight home is stopping in Cochin and then New Delhi in India I will need an Indian visa so I can clear immigration in Cochin and get across to the domestic terminal in order to catch the flight to Delhi. This apparently isn't something they can provide on arrival in fact is only something one can acquire with at least 7 days notice at the cost of the best part of £200!!Astonished by this I called <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> to found out how on Earth this could have happened and they rudely informed me that it is my responsibility to check the visa requirements for my trip and there is nothing they can do apart from book me a different flight that transits through a country where I do not need a visa. I will also foot the bill for this privilege and ""of course"" will not be getting a refund for my original flight. Now I understand that it is of course my responsibility to check visa requirements for places I'm actually visiting, (although all good travel agents will make sure you know these things) but for transiting!!!? How on Earth can this even be legal!!?The ladies at the Male check-in desk informed me that my best option is to fly to Sri Lanka (where I don't need a visa) and then on to Dehli where I can catch my final flight however, on further inspection there are no available flights to Sri Lanka for another 2 days!!<http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> reluctantly agreed to try and figure me out a path home and all credit to them managed to come up with a brilliant solution -Flight from Male to Kuwiat in 18 hours time (recommended I get a hotel here for the night) followed by another night in Kuwait and then a flight back to London (£700). Not only is this highly inconvenient and expensive but I also found out after hanging up on Sadi the <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> worker who can only be described as an unhelpful, and rude abominable person with ZERO empathy, sympathy or common sense as to why this situation is UTTERLY OUTRAGEOUS!!) that I would need an unobtainable visa to get into Kuwait!!!It would seem it is this this company's policy to just sell people tickets without any concern for them actually getting there. If I had made it through MALE checkin I would have been locked in detention in Cochin and eventually sent back at my cost! Same in Kuwait!!After speaking to various people about this everyone seems to share the same viewpoint that this is OUTRAGEOUS!!The mistake itself is bad enough in the first place, how dare they sell tickets like this at all let alone sell them without informing people! But the rude customer service to boot with absolutely no acceptance of responsibility in such an obviously ludicrous situation. Followed by an attempt to sell me yet ANOTHER flight that required a visa. I'm absolutely flabberghasted!!SkyScanner surely doesn't not condone these reckless sales techniques!! I will be kicking up the biggest fuss imaginable about this. Fortunately I own a marketing company that employs 400 people.Get ready <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>, there's a storm coming! You absolute amateurs!"

5	I booked my flights through <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> and didn't pay too much attention to the online check in until today, the day before my flight. After a rush of panic Jan S. at the chat-customerservice saved my day by helping me fufill my information, smooth and easy. Service at high class!

5	Excellent support team!Thanks Enri for the fast action following my enquiry!
5	The first time I bought throug KIWI and it was perfect.I needed some help and I had a great assistance.
5	I would like to share that Tamara did today exceptional job helping me to add personal details to my flight. She was very helpful and nice all the way through.
5	I wish to thank to Richard Lucas, Puput, Daniel, and Caterina for all the efforts to solve my fly back home. They was very quickly to do so and the communication with them was perfect all the time. I lost my next fly on the way to Iceland because Easy Jet arrived too late but the staff from KIWI did everything best to make me feel secure with my booking and they also help me with one night in airport hotel Bloc at LGW so I can fully recommend KIWI to any one. You will not be disappointed from KIWI. Magnus R. Hansen
1	Avoid. Reading the 5 star reviews confirms my impression. The reviews are well-written but do have a number of things in common -- they are all just too gloating to fully believe, many of them quote the name of the agent and how wonderful he/she was, most of them say a lot about the booking but nothing really covincing,  the contrasting reviews that were critical are far more accurate,which detailed specific things and give a totally different impression.
5	I booked the tkts from Orlando to Shannon on  <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com>. The booking was very easy, process was convenient and navigation too. After booking, it asked me to contact them if i did not receive the payment confirmation within 5 mins. I contacted them via live chat, and Jakub was very helpful, understood my concern, checked and informed me that the booking was confirmed and that he was prepared to resend the confirmation by email if I had not received it. But I had got it by then.Great service, really impressed by the ease and promptness
5	Everything was okay, and the live chat works really good. I had a problem with my passport and I talk with the costumer service by this chat and they answered and helped me so fast.
4	We've updated our site so that live chat can be accessed from any page. Please contact us via chat for urgent cases. Skypicker team

5	I didn't get my email to book for special seating request due to fear of flying but Viktor helped me sort it last minute so I now have a stress less flight as I got to sit near window and my husband next to me. Thanks for going all out to fix this for me you were awesome.
5	Katie K was solid she helped me all the way to the end solved the whole trip pulled up multiple variations until we found the right flight that fit our needs best I purchased my flight right away.Thanks again!
5	Professional, quick, and not just a template that goes out to everyone with a query but very much personalised emails dealing with the issue.Despite different people dealing with my request there was an impressive and seamless service. Thanks to Miquel and others of the Kiwi team, Giorgi, Babak, Emre, Kristina!

5	Due to a technical problem on the airlines website, the flight we had booked was actually not flying.. First I spoke with Zuzana via chat and than by phone. She helped me a lot and made me more calm. The next day I spoke 2 times with Milica via chat and she really helped me step by step and was very patient while I asked for a moment. She spent a few hours with me to help me very professional. Really glad I met them.Zuzana & Milica, you are the best!!Kind regards, Gulsah Suzulmus
5	Very easy booking, quick, no hassle, good price. Also, I made an error when I tried to input the passport info but I got on the chat with Alex A, and Alex took care of the issue promptly. Give that man a raise, he's great. Thank you.
3	I asked to change my tripSend a lot of emailThe answer did not comeI've lost my reservation from this companyBecame not trust her now
5	I needed help with reserving seats and prices, so i used the <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> live chat.There was Jan who gave me all the help i needed with very nice and professional attitude, im very gratefull and satisfied for your service! Thank you! :)
5	I had some difficulties with them, as they did not send me a BP to a flight, so I had to pay some extra money @ the airport.But, with an app it works pretty good and this time, it was me who screwed up two bookings three times. I cant believe that, but they were able to solve it, free of charge, and their agent Michal was really nice to me.
5	Thank you very much for changing my flight to the most convince time.Thank you very much again.
5	Irina was very nice and helpful.She was very organised and I am really recommend to use Kiwi and their customer service was surprisingly good.
5	I could find a very cheap price return flight UK to Turkey.Return was with connection and it was changed by airline,Skypicker quickly sent an email with different options around same time,and rescheduled for me.Payment felt like Uoh I do not know this company, I hope it is not a scam and it wasn't. I took the insurance option anyway for airline troubles. You  know brokered ticket owners have less response from airline itself.I found it using momondo actually, so you guys need more advertising to get out there.
5	Daniela Demeterova helped us quickly and easy with passport problem, thank you!
5	I was very satisfied with the booking and services. Everything went without any complications.The company took care of everything, I just had to print out!I recommend highly
5	La pagina tiene muy buenos precioy disponibilidad. El problema es que tienes 72 horas antes de limite para confirmar y sacar las tarjetas de embarque.Contacte con el servicio al cliente via chat y me solucionaron los problemas sobre la marcha,son muy buenos y rapidos. Gracias a Irina por su ayuda y solucionarme mis fallos.
5	Viktor P.  was extremely helpful with adding checked bags to a reservation with a looming deadline. The website wasn't clear about not adding checked bags within 48 hours of flight. Very disappointed with that. Viktor helped with the return portion of the trip. Very patient and courteous. It made the experience more bearable and I'm not as stressed. Thank you Viktor!
5	Easy and fast with reasonable price.
5	These guys are amazing. I emailed them saying that I couldn't check in on self check in and they rang me straight away, sorted everything out and even rang me again after to make sure that I had boarded.
1	Terrible company. Raises prices due to no fault to customers. STAY AWAY
5	When I reserved my ticket I forgot information. I ask the kiwi support and Jaroslav Kouba help me very fast. Thank you for all.
4	Although what may seem an insignificant question, David was prompt and polite in his response to my enquiry. I am looking forward to rating <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> the 5th star in due course, so well done to David in making my transaction all the more worth it.

5	Great service and a Quick one to from Michaela O. Helped me pay to get extra luggage for My return flight
5	I received a text telling me I had 24 hours to do the online check-in. I tryed to do it 12 hours later, but it was closed. That made me very dissapointed, and i didn't know what to do, so i contacted livechat and got help from a very helpful person called Milica. And everything was fixed within minutes. Thumbs up for the live chat, but thumbs down that the information in the text was not right.
5	Nothing to complain about
5	Very good experience.
5	I have now tried some airlines received excellent servide many places. This time I bekyttet SKYPICKER, I can not describe in words what help and fight good service I have received at SKYPICKER !! I have needed some change entries after I booked for longer travel and some questions. I have gained more than 100 percent GOOD SERVICE at SKYPICKER and the answers to my questions have been obtimale and extremely fast, from a very friendly staff who took the time to get acquainted with my problems - once SKYPICKER always SKYPICKER! ! Many thanks to SKYPICKER !!!!
5	I booked with <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> after finding them through a popular search engine, as I had not heard of them before. I found the website very clean, thorough and easy to use. After a simple booking system, for 2 connecting flights may i add, I had a few questions. I proceeded to use the live chat option, which i find a great tool for 24hr assistance. The agent (Juan Carlos) was extremely helpful in answering my questions and even went beyond by finding me local businesses the I would need once arriving at my destination. Overall great experience
5	I was helped by Dorota as I was unsure if we had checked baggage for our domestic flights in Thailand. Her service was fast and efficient and I couldn't thank her enough :)
5	Ivana V helped me with some trouble regarding the name on my ticket and took care of the problem with no hesitation! The service was great thanks to Ivana. I thank you for the help
3	We are hoping to come to come to a good resolution with Kiwi.  An error occurred in booking (not sure if it is human error or computer error), but we were booked for a June 15 return flight rather than a July 15 return flight.  The error was discovered within 8-9 hours of booking. We contacted Kiwi immediately and were told that there were no refunds.  We are hoping that Kiwi will work with us.  Stay tuned.  I will let you know of our outcome.  I hope this doesn't ruin our 25th anniversary trip.
5	I spent the night at an airport in France after my flight was cancelled. I spent most of that night on the phone with Owen trying to resolve my problems. He is the best <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> staff member I have ever spoken with, is incredibly helpful, and very pleasant to speak with. Thanks Owen !
5	I'm very glad with the help on one problem with our booking, specially with Natali, which was so kind and invaluable. Thank you for your work
5	I talked with Tatev Grigorian and she was able to complete the check-in online with me even if the 72-hours-before limit was expied.She helped me to save 90€ at the airport, she was gentle, punctual and fast.One of the best customer-assistence I've ever had.
1	"I have booked my flight ticket from KUL to AKL, but the payment process did not go through at first. So I  contacted my bank and double-checked that my card is allowed for online payment, and I followed everything I need as skypicekr 's team advised. So the second time I tried using a different card, the payment did go through, but got canceled again due to a security issue with my reservation.I was very frustrated, but tried to book it again choosing a different date option with hope. Unfortunately, Same thing happened. My payment didn't go through again so I e-mailed to the team but received the same, repeated answer.I used another card of mine at that time, and the payment seemed like went through at first but eventually got canceled with the same reason. And the customer support team told me to use a different card AGAIN, but who carries that many different types of cards? I asked if there is any other option to make my payment process successful but all I could hear was ""Use a different card"".I am extremely frustrated booking my flights with Skypicker and their customer service is not very helpful AT ALL.Bad experience"
5	Great costumer service (Olga Celanova and many others before), this company have also the best way to buy air tickets, for the cheapest price you cannot find anywhere esle. I guarantee.
5	I am very pleased with my chat with Lena.  Well done.Thanks
5	This company insainly aweaome system. I dont need to waste time to make a call anymore. 24/7 live Chat. Plus they have Korean or Japanese staffs 2am to 2pm central Europe <http://time.It|time.It> was really great to talk with Kristyna. The best costomer center ever★★
1	"Do not buy from that company. You will pay and two hours later, you will get this email:""During the process of your booking we have encountered the following concern: There is a technical issue in the carrier's reservation system preventing us from finishing the booking.As a result of the above we will be refunding to you in full the cost of the initial booking.""And they will say that you refund will arrive in ten days.I was also supposed to get a 10$ voucher by clicking on a link on a page advertising their new app but never get anything!"
1	"The worst company ever! Unreliable and lack of customer service and flexibility, runs only to get the money from you, after, they are available just if you pay them more money, otherwise all the help you receive is just ""Sorry"" ..... Cheapest routes, and non-customer oriented, rules made to make you feel guilty, And then we come again to the saying, you get what you pay for, get the cheapest stuff, receive the shittiest service and understanding from customer support."
5	I would recommend Skypicker.
5	I am sooo thankful for the service i got from skypicker, i had problems two time and there was no problem to fix!special thanks to Jiri Cervenka who was so fast and very helpful!!!
5	I had to change my flights. After talking to Ryanair and not having an answer or any help, I decided to contact <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>. I talked to Lucie G.and I must say that her patience and kindness were amazing. It was the 8th person to be involved in this matter and she was the only one to really care about the subject. I had to stay in the chat with her for 4h but she really could solve my problem. I had problems with the flights and with the credit card. She never gave up on me. She was with me to the very end, making sure she could do everything to help me and she did. I'm really happy I could talk to her. I'm really happy about her job in this matter.
4	Boarding passes sent immediately ( I recommend Skypicker to send boarding passes to one APP in the modern phones..not so many people can print at once boarding passes)
5	Many thanks to Donald, who helped me a lot with registration!
3	I have yet to take my flights which won't be until next month. However I had a few concerns after reading a couple of bad revives. I was in contact with customer service, regarding an issue due to my own error & they resolved almost immediately. I was in contact with both Jan in customer service who acted swiftly & promptly to address my issue. I was contacted within 30 minutes by email Luis to inform me that the issue had been resolved. I had anticipated that it may take 24 hours but 30 minutes later all was resolved. This was down to good team work & dedicated customer service who really put their customer service skills to work. Great Job & thank you again to Jan for great job done & then thank you to Luis for a very swift follow up email. Hope my flights will come & go without any hitches :) Thanks again, Kind regards Leon
5	I find it very unreasonable that a checked bag must be under 15kg. That is far below many other airlines and it deters many customers from flying. That being said, I received generous support from the kiwi customer support. Lukas gave me his full attention and respect while helping me with this issue. If it wasn't for Lukas I would have most likely cancelled my booking and have went with another travel agency.
5	I made a mistake which was 100% my fault and Dorota and Monika helped me out of the situation with their hard effort. Their response was very polite and quick. Great customer service.
5	Very good deals and great costumer support! I spoke to Monika on the online chat last night and even tough it was late Sunday night she called Ryanair and made my Check-in so I could avoid the ridiculous fee 45 euros fee that the airline charges for Checking in at the airport. Thanks Monika and all the great Kiwi team!
1	The worst flight company I , ever used. Vi booked return tickets copenhagen , Hurgada Directly none between landiger. but on the way home vi landet in Bilund. and The disclaimedall , responsibility by having give us the wrong times for departure and return, loss both times a 1 tendons into the plane actually had to fly so lucky of we got there two hours before both times . the claimed it was air cairo who had not reported changes, but apparently we were the only ones who had not got the change off flight time and when we asket in the airport the time for despartur it has not bin change. so never vi will never use skypicker again, rather pay more,then not by using skypicker
5	"I booked a flight from Mexico to Manchester at a good price, It was planned as a 3 scales or connections, I had to manually check-in on the airport counter for the first flight (Mexican Volaris), where I was charged extra for my luggage because their system reported my on-line luggage payment made on <http://Skypicker.com|Skypicker.com> as ""declined"" and also they had a different policy for the size of the carry-on luggage, so immediately contacted <http://Skypicker.com|Skypicker.com> and explained the problem, they just asked me to sent a scan of the vouchers for the extra payment, which I sent and some days later they refunded the extra money charged by that volaris airline. <http://Skypicker.com|Skypicker.com> customer support where prompt to respond and they attended my inquiry in a great way. No doubt I will choose them to flight again and also I will speak good of them to my friends."

5	Dealt with Radek and Klara when booking seats to Bangkok, both were incredibly helpful.
4	I had a question about my bagage and I chatted with Jan. He helped me very well. My problem was solved In a few minutes. Thank you Jan
5	There was a discrepancy in pricing regarding online check in (and the associated fee) on one of my flights with Jet2, which I booked through <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com>. I emailed Jet2 directly, but never heard back. I forwarded the message to Kiwi and got an immediate answer from Travel Consultant Fahd, who refunded the fee without further issue. Like I told Fahd in response, this type of customer service is increasingly rare, especially in airline travel, and I very much appreciate the prompt, efficient service and will definitely use <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com> for my future travel needs! Thanks again Fahd and <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com>
5	I talked to Lenka.I must say, what a pleasant experience. I am a little in love. She solved all problems in no time with a kind, smiling and pleasant voice.
5	"I experienced a cancellation for my (budget) flight from Denpasar-Adelaide due to volcano eruptions. At first, I was worried that Skypicker would not book me a different ticket under the disguise of ""force majeure are exceptions"". However, surprisingly they were able to book me for a completely new flight (non budget even!) within 2 hours. I'm also told that I could claim the accommodation costs and transportation costs incurred. Therefore, the ""Skypicker Guarantee"" truly does speak for itself!I can only hope that my upcoming flight Denpasar-Jakarta will not be delayed, else I'll have to be in contact with Monica Snowden, Leonardo, Sawalani and the lovely team from Skypicker again :)"
4	I had a very mixed experience with Kiwi.com.... I was encouraged by the prices, but quickly put off by the deadline for the online check in being 3 days before the flight. They should have that in neon somewhere on the site as it is then followed by the warning you may have to pay an extra €140, and if you are flying with Ryanair, they will charge! Anyway, after the shock of missing the check in deadline settled, I luckily found Jan.S on the live chat and she sorted it all out for me! Thanks Jan. You are a life saver!
5	This company offer 5 stars of quality with air ticket book. Especially when I facing some name spelling issue all of their customers service consultant treat me patiently and guide me step by step to proceed the mistake correction. The agent finally Re-book my air ticket to my maid. Very thanks to all of you. Gratitude.
5	I had a flight cancelled and one of Skypicker's travel consultants, Martin Carter, responded almost immediately and is working hard to reschedule my flight. It is always reassuring when customer service is so responsive. Thanks!
5	Thank you, Ondra P. for helping to manage my flight changes, conversation was friendly and easy. So I'm waiting for my Barcelona journey :)
5	I have have booked my last few flights with <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com>Being in Brazil, most site do not allow me to books flights being a tourist here. Often a cpf-number is asked for or something else does not work out while trying to process a payment. I am sooooo, happy that finally I can easily buy tickets in Brazil again.Also, I love how, the site, the moment I pick a date, shows me the price comparison for all dates of that month. Such good technology.An finally, once my luggage was calculated incorrectly. I received a refund without a problem and the web site flaw was taken care of right away. Highly recommended!

5	The process went very smoothly! Jakub understood me and was able to get the information I was asking for seemingly with no problem at all and with ease! Y'all should give him a raise! And if you don't, I will! 5 star service for sure!!
5	i received a call from kiwi agent to be informed about cancelled flight and booking of a new one...all information was clear and I appreciated effort they had put into to put me on a new closest flight with a different company.thank you!Mirka
5	My trip is fast approaching, I haven't yet boarded a flight I have booked with sky picker but I have had a few changes I've needed to make regarding my upcoming flights. Attempting to make changes via the airlines direct website was confusing and time consuming. I contacted skypicker instead and received a response almost immediately. I communicated with Lucy Krylova and she was extremely helpful and informative. Quickly, she updated my information and resolved my issues. Couldn't be more pleased. Highly recommend.
5	Daniele grazie è stato molto gentile, professionale e preciso, mi ha spiegato tutto con precisione. Grazie.
5	I wanted to add extra luggage to one of my flights coming up for a connection flight from Kuala Lumpur to Denpasar, and Patrik, the customer service agent was extremely quick, helpful and kind with processing my request. <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> in general has been easy to manage, informative and a great way to manage my long and what could have been an arduous journey, a lot less stressful.

5	Thank you once more Martin for answering my question regarding booking of flights to New Zealand in December. I really appreciate that even though you didn't know the answer you promptly asked your manager and could provide me a satisfactory answer within minutes.
1	These thieves stole my money. I went to the Saudi airlines office at the airport to change my flight and the guy told me their system cannot recognize the eticket number or the booking number tgey gave me. I emailed them later about this incident with no reply!!!!!
5	I had some issues due to a lost passport and the Skypicker team really helped me out. Emre T. changed the details for my flights quickly and easily without me having to do anything. As I said in the title, great service!
5	I entered some information with an error online and noticed on confirmation. I went to online chat help and an agent called Lusine was very helpful and will contact the airline to make the change. She will then send me a new E-ticket with the corrected informationGreat service
5	I just had my first communication with <http://Kiwi.com|Kiwi.com> cutomer support and it was absolutelly awesome! My travel consultant Katka K. was fully profesional and willing to help me with all of my questions. Thank you!
4	So far, so good. I just booked my flights today as this was far and away the best price I could find for a summer flight JFK-Copenhagen and then Rekjavik-JFK. I noticed there were no seat assignments noted in the booking, so went to the website and used the chat function to talk to Yulia K. She was very helpful in saying she would contact the airlines. I got an email within the hour offering me seat assignments for an increased fee on one flight and no option for seat assignments on the way back. I appreciated the swiftness and efficiency. Minus one star for being very pushy about asking me to write a 'positive review' numerous times. First asking me to write one before the problem had even been resolved! But overall, good experience so far.
1	You think you are getting a USA company but all reps are in Europe, barely speak in English, use the euro and are a fricking day ahead of us. We had 3 canceled flights and as much as they tried to help us it was so so difficult to get anything done. Especially when the person doesn't speak the language wellNever again
5	She was helpful and gave us all the information we needed. She was pleasent and had a nice attitude.
1	All booked flights changed at the last moment. No online checkins soms we had to pay at the airport. Bad service . Just book directly true the airline!
5	Henry was very helpful in modifying our reservation.  I was a little disappointed that adding luggage was so expensive, but evidently that's on me for not including it in the original reservation.
5	everything was very good

5	I would like to say thank this company for the awareness me in such thin moment how a schedule change of my flight!
5	Thankyou for your quick response and friendly support in are ticket changes.
5	I missed the deadline for filling my passport information so Kiwi could handle my check-in, so I had to do it by myself through the airlines website. I first seemed to have some problems with the airline reference number that Kiwi provided so I contacted the customer service. Perhaps this was my own mistake because later I was able to do the check-in by myself, but I was happy that two people contacted me from Kiwi in a rather short notice, Pavel Burian and Lukas Kliment. The fact that I even received a phone call from Pavel in order to take care of my problem showed me that Kiwi is a trustworthy company which I will definitely also use in the future.

5	Kiwi came through when the airline couldn't!  We were unable to book seats directly with the airline, but Kiwi had us with seats and boarding passes within minutes.  It was such a pleasant, time and money saving first experience!  I'll be checking with Kiwi before I purchase airfare as a rule going forward.  Thank you Kiwi.
5	I booked two tickets for the 6th august 2016 and the customer service was always available to reply to my questions, both via chat and phone.Now I'm waiting for the boarding passes and I'll update this review once the travel will be completed ;)

5	I am so grateful to Kiwi for quickly and painlessly rebooking my entire trip on four different airlines after a crucia flight was cancelled due to weather. They were so kind and found alternate flights quickly. They have saved my Christmas!
5	It was the first time I used the site, was a bit anxious and to be honest skeptical. However, I ventured on when I found out that it was previously Skypicker. Hadn't used them either, but they had more internet presence. I contacted the help desk to get more info about validating the purchase, and that the airline was aware of my purchase.The chat is amazing, and Lydie was the perfect representative. She was quite helpful and patient, checking everything regarding my booking. Even though I received more emails, mid-chat, confirming my purchase, and supplying all the info necessary for my flight.Great webpage. Great deals. Great customer service. 10/10 will return, and recommend
5	Very good guidance for my check in steps. Thank's a lot Jan Lukasek !
5	I had a very nice experience with this travel agency, wich helped me out in moments of stress, and the travel consultant Polina was able to offer me other alternatives, avoiding any additional costs.Polina saved my travel!Thank you very much! I will keep on recommending Kiwi to all my friends and family.
5	David was very great in helping me get an alternative flight.
5	Thanks for helping us in such a friendly and efficient way when we missed our connection flight and nobody at the airport felt responsible for us!
5	I love <http://kiwi.com|kiwi.com>
5	I called 6 time and all of employer said I dont know, I cant help etc, the only person was Mohamed who fix the problem.After I called Mohamed he called me  hours after and resolve the problem with tickets.Mohamed THANK YOU VERY MUTCH........
5	Great service after willingness to learn and adapt in reaction to solving my problem. I made a misstake in booking (there is no warning on what names to use) with the names on the tickets for my flights.At first they insisted on paying the airliner fees for name-change. Together we found out - if the name-change is undoubtedly the same person - there's no fee to pay.Very satisfactory solution and good reaction time on every mail sent.I would suggest some form of warning whilst booking tickets when filling out the names! Doing it right from the beginning is so much easier..
5	There were security issues related to the payment that I transferred and so I called Kiwi Services and the staff was really helpful the issue was sorted out in less than 2 hours and the payment was successful.
1	I fly regularly from Dublin Ireland to LAX .I always check fares on Skyscanner.

Other sites same flight -same airline £380 .Yes £650 cheaper SAY NO MORE !!!
4	I wanted to thank Jana Turčanová for her great assistance yesterday. I had a problem with my booking and couldn't find neither the ref. number nor the email of the flight. Jana, with a patient and friendly tone offered to call me back in a while with the information needed. People like Jana makes the customers believe in the company. Thank you very much for your help and my recognition to your profesional skills.
5	Awer Does Skypicker offer Travel Insurance?How do I know which airport my flight departs from / arrives to? And what is the airport IATA code?Is it possible to add any extras to my flight (e.g. bikes or sport equipment, special meals or seating arrangements)?I have a promotion code, how can I use it?I am connecting to another airport via coach. Do I have enough time to get there?
